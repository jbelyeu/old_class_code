in

sherlock
holmes
she
is
always
the
woman  have
seldom
heard
him
mention
her
under
any
other
name
in
his
eyes
she
eclipses
and
predominates
the
whole
of
her
sex
it
was
not
that
he
felt
any
emotion
akin
to
love
for
irene
adler
all
emotions
and
that
one
particularly
were
abhorrent
to
his
cold
precise
but
admirably
balanced
mind
he
was  take
it
the
most
perfect
reasoning
and
observing
machine
that
the
world
has
seen
but
as  lover
he
would
have
placed
himself
in  false
position
he
never
spoke
of
the
softer
passions
save
with  gibe
and  sneer
they
were
admirable
things
for
the
observer
excellent
for
drawing
the
veil
from
men  motives
and
actions
but
for
the
trained
reasoner
to
admit
such
intrusions
into
his
own
delicate
and
finely
adjusted
temperament
was
to
introduce  distracting
factor
which
might
throw  doubt
upon
all
his
mental
results
grit
in  sensitive
instrument
or  crack
in
one
of
his
own
high
power
lenses
would
not
be
more
disturbing
than  strong
emotion
in  nature
such
as
his
and
yet
there
was
but
one
woman
to
him
and
that
woman
was
the
late
irene
adler
of
dubious
and
questionable
memory  had
seen
little
of
holmes
lately
my
marriage
had
drifted
us
away
from
each
other
my
own
complete
happiness
and
the
home
centred
interests
which
rise
up
around
the
man
who
first
finds
himself
master
of
his
own
establishment
were
sufficient
to
absorb
all
my
attention
while
holmes
who
loathed
every
form
of
society
with
his
whole
bohemian
soul
remained
in
our
lodgings
in
baker
street
buried
among
his
old
books
and
alternating
from
week
to
week
between
cocaine
and
ambition
the
drowsiness
of
the
drug
and
the
fierce
energy
of
his
own
keen
nature
he
was
still
as
ever
deeply
attracted
by
the
study
of
crime
and
occupied
his
immense
faculties
and
extraordinary
powers
of
observation
in
following
out
those
clues
and
clearing
up
those
mysteries
which
had
been
abandoned
as
hopeless
by
the
official
police
from
time
to
time  heard
some
vague
account
of
his
doings
of
his
summons
to
odessa
in
the
case
of
the
trepoff
murder
of
his
clearing
up
of
the
singular
tragedy
of
the
atkinson
brothers
at
trincomalee
and
finally
of
the
mission
which
he
had
accomplished
so
delicately
and
successfully
for
the
reigning
family
of
holland
beyond
these
signs
of
his
activity
however
which  merely
shared
with
all
the
readers
of
the
daily
press  knew
little
of
my
former
friend
and
companion
one
night
it
was
on
the
twentieth
of
march  was
returning
from  journey
to  patient
for  had
now
returned
to
civil
practice
when
my
way
led
me
through
baker
street
as  passed
the
well
remembered
door
which
must
always
be
associated
in
my
mind
with
my
wooing
and
with
the
dark
incidents
of
the
study
in
scarlet  was
seized
with  keen
desire
to
see
holmes
again
and
to
know
how
he
was
employing
his
extraordinary
powers
his
rooms
were
brilliantly
lit
and
even
as  looked
up  saw
his
tall
spare
figure
pass
twice
in  dark
silhouette
against
the
blind
he
was
pacing
the
room
swiftly
eagerly
with
his
head
sunk
upon
his
chest
and
his
hands
clasped
behind
him
to
me
who
knew
his
every
mood
and
habit
his
attitude
and
manner
told
their
own
story
he
was
at
work
again
he
had
risen
out
of
his
drug
created
dreams
and
was
hot
upon
the
scent
of
some
new
problem  rang
the
bell
and
was
shown
up
to
the
chamber
which
had
formerly
been
in
part
my
own
his
manner
was
not
effusive
it
seldom
was
but
he
was
glad  think
to
see
me
with
hardly  word
spoken
but
with  kindly
eye
he
waved
me
to
an
armchair
threw
across
his
case
of
cigars
and
indicated  spirit
case
and  gasogene
in
the
corner
then
he
stood
before
the
fire
and
looked
me
over
in
his
singular
introspective
fashion
wedlock
suits
you
he
remarked  think
watson
that
you
have
put
on
seven
and  half
pounds
since  saw
you
seven  answered
indeed  should
have
thought  little
more
just  trifle
more  fancy
watson
and
in
practice
again  observe
you
did
not
tell
me
that
you
intended
to
go
into
harness
then
how
do
you
know  see
it  deduce
it
how
do  know
that
you
have
been
getting
yourself
very
wet
lately
and
that
you
have  most
clumsy
and
careless
servant
girl
my
dear
holmes
said  this
is
too
much
you
would
certainly
have
been
burned
had
you
lived  few
centuries
ago
it
is
true
that  had  country
walk
on
thursday
and
came
home
in  dreadful
mess
but
as  have
changed
my
clothes  can  imagine
how
you
deduce
it
as
to
mary
jane
she
is
incorrigible
and
my
wife
has
given
her
notice
but
there
again  fail
to
see
how
you
work
it
out
he
chuckled
to
himself
and
rubbed
his
long
nervous
hands
together
it
is
simplicity
itself
said
he
my
eyes
tell
me
that
on
the
inside
of
your
left
shoe
just
where
the
firelight
strikes
it
the
leather
is
scored
by
six
almost
parallel
cuts
obviously
they
have
been
caused
by
someone
who
has
very
carelessly
scraped
round
the
edges
of
the
sole
in
order
to
remove
crusted
mud
from
it
hence
you
see
my
double
deduction
that
you
had
been
out
in
vile
weather
and
that
you
had  particularly
malignant
boot
slitting
specimen
of
the
london
slavey
as
to
your
practice
if  gentleman
walks
into
my
rooms
smelling
of
iodoform
with  black
mark
of
nitrate
of
silver
upon
his
right
forefinger
and  bulge
on
the
right
side
of
his
top
hat
to
show
where
he
has
secreted
his
stethoscope  must
be
dull
indeed
if  do
not
pronounce
him
to
be
an
active
member
of
the
medical
profession  could
not
help
laughing
at
the
ease
with
which
he
explained
his
process
of
deduction
when  hear
you
give
your
reasons  remarked
the
thing
always
appears
to
me
to
be
so
ridiculously
simple
that  could
easily
do
it
myself
though
at
each
successive
instance
of
your
reasoning  am
baffled
until
you
explain
your
process
and
yet  believe
that
my
eyes
are
as
good
as
yours
quite
so
he
answered
lighting  cigarette
and
throwing
himself
down
into
an
armchair
you
see
but
you
do
not
observe
the
distinction
is
clear
for
example
you
have
frequently
seen
the
steps
which
lead
up
from
the
hall
to
this
room
frequently
how
often
well
some
hundreds
of
times
then
how
many
are
there
how
many  don  know
quite
so
you
have
not
observed
and
yet
you
have
seen
that
is
just
my
point
now  know
that
there
are
seventeen
steps
because  have
both
seen
and
observed
by
the
way
since
you
are
interested
in
these
little
problems
and
since
you
are
good
enough
to
chronicle
one
or
two
of
my
trifling
experiences
you
may
be
interested
in
this
he
threw
over  sheet
of
thick
pink
tinted
notepaper
which
had
been
lying
open
upon
the
table
it
came
by
the
last
post
said
he
read
it
aloud
the
note
was
undated
and
without
either
signature
or
address
there
will
call
upon
you
to
night
at  quarter
to
eight  clock
it
said  gentleman
who
desires
to
consult
you
upon  matter
of
the
very
deepest
moment
your
recent
services
to
one
of
the
royal
houses
of
europe
have
shown
that
you
are
one
who
may
safely
be
trusted
with
matters
which
are
of
an
importance
which
can
hardly
be
exaggerated
this
account
of
you
we
have
from
all
quarters
received
be
in
your
chamber
then
at
that
hour
and
do
not
take
it
amiss
if
your
visitor
wear  mask
this
is
indeed  mystery  remarked
what
do
you
imagine
that
it
means  have
no
data
yet
it
is  capital
mistake
to
theorise
before
one
has
data
insensibly
one
begins
to
twist
facts
to
suit
theories
instead
of
theories
to
suit
facts
but
the
note
itself
what
do
you
deduce
from
it  carefully
examined
the
writing
and
the
paper
upon
which
it
was
written
the
man
who
wrote
it
was
presumably
well
to
do  remarked
endeavouring
to
imitate
my
companion  processes
such
paper
could
not
be
bought
under
half  crown  packet
it
is
peculiarly
strong
and
stiff
peculiar
that
is
the
very
word
said
holmes
it
is
not
an
english
paper
at
all
hold
it
up
to
the
light  did
so
and
the
texture
of
the
paper
what
do
you
make
of
that
asked
holmes
the
name
of
the
maker
no
stands
for
gesellschaft
which
is
the
german
at
our
continental
not
far
from
carlsbad
remarkable
as
being
the
scene
of
the
death
of
wallenstein
and
for
its
numerous
glass
factories
his
eyes
wrote
the
note
is  german
do
you
note
the
peculiar
construction
of
the
sentence
this
account
of
you
we
have
from
all
quarters
received  frenchman
or
russian
could
not
have
written
that
it
is
the
german
who
is
so
uncourteous
to
his
verbs
it
only
remains
therefore
to
discover
what
is
wanted
by
this
german
who
writes
upon
bohemian
paper
and
prefers
wearing  mask
to
showing
his
face
and
here
he
comes
if  am
not
mistaken
to
resolve
all
our
doubts
as
he
spoke
there
was
the
sharp
sound
of
horses
hoofs
and
grating
wheels
against
the
curb
followed
by  sharp
pull
at
the
bell
holmes
whistled  pair
by
the
sound
said
he
yes
he
continued
glancing
out
of
the
window  nice
little
brougham
and  pair
of
beauties  hundred
and
fifty
guineas
apiece
there  money
in
this
case
watson
if
there
is
nothing
else  think
that  had
better
go
holmes
not  bit
doctor
stay
where
you
are  am
lost
without
my
boswell
and
this
promises
to
be
interesting
it
would
be  pity
to
miss
it
but
your
client
never
mind
him  may
want
your
help
and
so
may
he
here
he
comes
sit
down
in
that
armchair
doctor
and
give
us
your
best
attention  slow
and
heavy
step
which
had
been
heard
upon
the
stairs
and
in
the
passage
paused
immediately
outside
the
door
then
there
was  loud
and
authoritative
tap
come
in
said
holmes  man
entered
who
could
hardly
have
been
less
than
six
feet
six
inches
in
height
with
the
chest
and
limbs
of  hercules
his
dress
was
rich
with  richness
which
would
in
england
be
looked
upon
as
akin
to
bad
taste
heavy
bands
of
astrakhan
were
slashed
across
the
sleeves
and
fronts
of
his
double
breasted
coat
while
the
deep
blue
cloak
which
was
thrown
over
his
shoulders
was
lined
with
flame
coloured
silk
and
secured
at
the
neck
with  brooch
which
consisted
of  single
flaming
beryl
boots
which
extended
halfway
up
his
calves
and
which
were
trimmed
at
the
tops
with
rich
brown
fur
completed
the
impression
of
barbaric
opulence
which
was
suggested
by
his
whole
appearance
he
carried  broad
brimmed
hat
in
his
hand
while
he
wore
across
the
upper
part
of
his
face
extending
down
past
the
cheekbones  black
vizard
mask
which
he
had
apparently
adjusted
that
very
moment
for
his
hand
was
still
raised
to
it
as
he
entered
from
the
lower
part
of
the
face
he
appeared
to
be  man
of
strong
character
with  thick
hanging
lip
and  long
straight
chin
suggestive
of
resolution
pushed
to
the
length
of
obstinacy
you
had
my
note
he
asked
with  deep
harsh
voice
and  strongly
marked
german
accent  told
you
that  would
call
he
looked
from
one
to
the
other
of
us
as
if
uncertain
which
to
address
pray
take  seat
said
holmes
this
is
my
friend
and
colleague
dr
watson
who
is
occasionally
good
enough
to
help
me
in
my
cases
whom
have  the
honour
to
address
you
may
address
me
as
the
count
von
kramm  bohemian
nobleman  understand
that
this
gentleman
your
friend
is  man
of
honour
and
discretion
whom  may
trust
with  matter
of
the
most
extreme
importance
if
not  should
much
prefer
to
communicate
with
you
alone  rose
to
go
but
holmes
caught
me
by
the
wrist
and
pushed
me
back
into
my
chair
it
is
both
or
none
said
he
you
may
say
before
this
gentleman
anything
which
you
may
say
to
me
the
count
shrugged
his
broad
shoulders
then  must
begin
said
he
by
binding
you
both
to
absolute
secrecy
for
two
years
at
the
end
of
that
time
the
matter
will
be
of
no
importance
at
present
it
is
not
too
much
to
say
that
it
is
of
such
weight
it
may
have
an
influence
upon
european
history  promise
said
holmes
and  you
will
excuse
this
mask
continued
our
strange
visitor
the
august
person
who
employs
me
wishes
his
agent
to
be
unknown
to
you
and  may
confess
at
once
that
the
title
by
which  have
just
called
myself
is
not
exactly
my
own  was
aware
of
it
said
holmes
dryly
the
circumstances
are
of
great
delicacy
and
every
precaution
has
to
be
taken
to
quench
what
might
grow
to
be
an
immense
scandal
and
seriously
compromise
one
of
the
reigning
families
of
europe
to
speak
plainly
the
matter
implicates
the
great
house
of
ormstein
hereditary
kings
of
bohemia  was
also
aware
of
that
murmured
holmes
settling
himself
down
in
his
armchair
and
closing
his
eyes
our
visitor
glanced
with
some
apparent
surprise
at
the
languid
lounging
figure
of
the
man
who
had
been
no
doubt
depicted
to
him
as
the
most
incisive
reasoner
and
most
energetic
agent
in
europe
holmes
slowly
reopened
his
eyes
and
looked
impatiently
at
his
gigantic
client
if
your
majesty
would
condescend
to
state
your
case
he
remarked  should
be
better
able
to
advise
you
the
man
sprang
from
his
chair
and
paced
up
and
down
the
room
in
uncontrollable
agitation
then
with  gesture
of
desperation
he
tore
the
mask
from
his
face
and
hurled
it
upon
the
ground
you
are
right
he
cried  am
the
king
why
should  attempt
to
conceal
it
why
indeed
murmured
holmes
your
majesty
had
not
spoken
before  was
aware
that  was
addressing
wilhelm
gottsreich
sigismond
von
ormstein
grand
duke
of
cassel
felstein
and
hereditary
king
of
bohemia
but
you
can
understand
said
our
strange
visitor
sitting
down
once
more
and
passing
his
hand
over
his
high
white
forehead
you
can
understand
that  am
not
accustomed
to
doing
such
business
in
my
own
person
yet
the
matter
was
so
delicate
that  could
not
confide
it
to
an
agent
without
putting
myself
in
his
power  have
come
incognito
from
prague
for
the
purpose
of
consulting
you
then
pray
consult
said
holmes
shutting
his
eyes
once
more
the
facts
are
briefly
these
some
five
years
ago
during  lengthy
visit
to
warsaw  made
the
acquaintance
of
the
well
known
adventuress
irene
adler
the
name
is
no
doubt
familiar
to
you
kindly
look
her
up
in
my
index
doctor
murmured
holmes
without
opening
his
eyes
for
many
years
he
had
adopted  system
of
docketing
all
paragraphs
concerning
men
and
things
so
that
it
was
difficult
to
name  subject
or  person
on
which
he
could
not
at
once
furnish
information
in
this
case  found
her
biography
sandwiched
in
between
that
of  hebrew
rabbi
and
that
of  staff
commander
who
had
written  monograph
upon
the
deep
sea
fishes
let
me
see
said
holmes
hum
born
in
new
jersey
in
the
year
contralto
hum
la
scala
hum
prima
donna
imperial
opera
of
warsaw
yes
retired
from
operatic
stage
ha
living
in
london
quite
so
your
majesty
as  understand
became
entangled
with
this
young
person
wrote
her
some
compromising
letters
and
is
now
desirous
of
getting
those
letters
back
precisely
so
but
how
was
there  secret
marriage
none
no
legal
papers
or
certificates
none
then  fail
to
follow
your
majesty
if
this
young
person
should
produce
her
letters
for
blackmailing
or
other
purposes
how
is
she
to
prove
their
authenticity
there
is
the
writing
pooh
pooh
forgery
my
private
note
paper
stolen
my
own
seal
imitated
my
photograph
bought
we
were
both
in
the
photograph
oh
dear
that
is
very
bad
your
majesty
has
indeed
committed
an
indiscretion  was
mad
insane
you
have
compromised
yourself
seriously  was
only
crown
prince
then  was
young  am
but
thirty
now
it
must
be
recovered
we
have
tried
and
failed
your
majesty
must
pay
it
must
be
bought
she
will
not
sell
stolen
then
five
attempts
have
been
made
twice
burglars
in
my
pay
ransacked
her
house
once
we
diverted
her
luggage
when
she
travelled
twice
she
has
been
waylaid
there
has
been
no
result
no
sign
of
it
absolutely
none
holmes
laughed
it
is
quite  pretty
little
problem
said
he
but  very
serious
one
to
me
returned
the
king
reproachfully
very
indeed
and
what
does
she
propose
to
do
with
the
photograph
to
ruin
me
but
how  am
about
to
be
married
so  have
heard
to
clotilde
lothman
von
saxe
meningen
second
daughter
of
the
king
of
scandinavia
you
may
know
the
strict
principles
of
her
family
she
is
herself
the
very
soul
of
delicacy  shadow
of  doubt
as
to
my
conduct
would
bring
the
matter
to
an
end
and
irene
adler
threatens
to
send
them
the
photograph
and
she
will
do
it  know
that
she
will
do
it
you
do
not
know
her
but
she
has  soul
of
steel
she
has
the
face
of
the
most
beautiful
of
women
and
the
mind
of
the
most
resolute
of
men
rather
than  should
marry
another
woman
there
are
no
lengths
to
which
she
would
not
go
none
you
are
sure
that
she
has
not
sent
it
yet  am
sure
and
why
because
she
has
said
that
she
would
send
it
on
the
day
when
the
betrothal
was
publicly
proclaimed
that
will
be
next
monday
oh
then
we
have
three
days
yet
said
holmes
with  yawn
that
is
very
fortunate
as  have
one
or
two
matters
of
importance
to
look
into
just
at
present
your
majesty
will
of
course
stay
in
london
for
the
present
certainly
you
will
find
me
at
the
langham
under
the
name
of
the
count
von
kramm
then  shall
drop
you  line
to
let
you
know
how
we
progress
pray
do
so  shall
be
all
anxiety
then
as
to
money
you
have
carte
blanche
absolutely  tell
you
that  would
give
one
of
the
provinces
of
my
kingdom
to
have
that
photograph
and
for
present
expenses
the
king
took  heavy
chamois
leather
bag
from
under
his
cloak
and
laid
it
on
the
table
there
are
three
hundred
pounds
in
gold
and
seven
hundred
in
notes
he
said
holmes
scribbled  receipt
upon  sheet
of
his
note
book
and
handed
it
to
him
and
mademoiselle  address
he
asked
is
briony
lodge
serpentine
avenue
st
john  wood
holmes
took  note
of
it
one
other
question
said
he
was
the
photograph  cabinet
it
was
then
good
night
your
majesty
and  trust
that
we
shall
soon
have
some
good
news
for
you
and
good
night
watson
he
added
as
the
wheels
of
the
royal
brougham
rolled
down
the
street
if
you
will
be
good
enough
to
call
to
morrow
afternoon
at
three  clock  should
like
to
chat
this
little
matter
over
with
you
ii
at
three  clock
precisely  was
at
baker
street
but
holmes
had
not
yet
returned
the
landlady
informed
me
that
he
had
left
the
house
shortly
after
eight  clock
in
the
morning  sat
down
beside
the
fire
however
with
the
intention
of
awaiting
him
however
long
he
might
be  was
already
deeply
interested
in
his
inquiry
for
though
it
was
surrounded
by
none
of
the
grim
and
strange
features
which
were
associated
with
the
two
crimes
which  have
already
recorded
still
the
nature
of
the
case
and
the
exalted
station
of
his
client
gave
it  character
of
its
own
indeed
apart
from
the
nature
of
the
investigation
which
my
friend
had
on
hand
there
was
something
in
his
masterly
grasp
of  situation
and
his
keen
incisive
reasoning
which
made
it  pleasure
to
me
to
study
his
system
of
work
and
to
follow
the
quick
subtle
methods
by
which
he
disentangled
the
most
inextricable
mysteries
so
accustomed
was  to
his
invariable
success
that
the
very
possibility
of
his
failing
had
ceased
to
enter
into
my
head
it
was
close
upon
four
before
the
door
opened
and  drunken
looking
groom
ill
kempt
and
side
whiskered
with
an
inflamed
face
and
disreputable
clothes
walked
into
the
room
accustomed
as  was
to
my
friend  amazing
powers
in
the
use
of
disguises  had
to
look
three
times
before  was
certain
that
it
was
indeed
he
with  nod
he
vanished
into
the
bedroom
whence
he
emerged
in
five
minutes
tweed
suited
and
respectable
as
of
old
putting
his
hands
into
his
pockets
he
stretched
out
his
legs
in
front
of
the
fire
and
laughed
heartily
for
some
minutes
well
really
he
cried
and
then
he
choked
and
laughed
again
until
he
was
obliged
to
lie
back
limp
and
helpless
in
the
chair
what
is
it
it  quite
too
funny  am
sure
you
could
never
guess
how  employed
my
morning
or
what  ended
by
doing  can  imagine  suppose
that
you
have
been
watching
the
habits
and
perhaps
the
house
of
miss
irene
adler
quite
so
but
the
sequel
was
rather
unusual  will
tell
you
however  left
the
house  little
after
eight  clock
this
morning
in
the
character
of  groom
out
of
work
there
is  wonderful
sympathy
and
freemasonry
among
horsey
men
be
one
of
them
and
you
will
know
all
that
there
is
to
know  soon
found
briony
lodge
it
is  bijou
villa
with  garden
at
the
back
but
built
out
in
front
right
up
to
the
road
two
stories
chubb
lock
to
the
door
large
sitting
room
on
the
right
side
well
furnished
with
long
windows
almost
to
the
floor
and
those
preposterous
english
window
fasteners
which  child
could
open
behind
there
was
nothing
remarkable
save
that
the
passage
window
could
be
reached
from
the
top
of
the
coach
house  walked
round
it
and
examined
it
closely
from
every
point
of
view
but
without
noting
anything
else
of
interest  then
lounged
down
the
street
and
found
as  expected
that
there
was  mews
in  lane
which
runs
down
by
one
wall
of
the
garden  lent
the
ostlers  hand
in
rubbing
down
their
horses
and
received
in
exchange
twopence  glass
of
half
and
half
two
fills
of
shag
tobacco
and
as
much
information
as  could
desire
about
miss
adler
to
say
nothing
of
half  dozen
other
people
in
the
neighbourhood
in
whom  was
not
in
the
least
interested
but
whose
biographies  was
compelled
to
listen
to
and
what
of
irene
adler  asked
oh
she
has
turned
all
the
men  heads
down
in
that
part
she
is
the
daintiest
thing
under  bonnet
on
this
planet
so
say
the
serpentine
mews
to  man
she
lives
quietly
sings
at
concerts
drives
out
at
five
every
day
and
returns
at
seven
sharp
for
dinner
seldom
goes
out
at
other
times
except
when
she
sings
has
only
one
male
visitor
but  good
deal
of
him
he
is
dark
handsome
and
dashing
never
calls
less
than
once  day
and
often
twice
he
is  mr
godfrey
norton
of
the
inner
temple
see
the
advantages
of  cabman
as  confidant
they
had
driven
him
home  dozen
times
from
serpentine
mews
and
knew
all
about
him
when  had
listened
to
all
they
had
to
tell  began
to
walk
up
and
down
near
briony
lodge
once
more
and
to
think
over
my
plan
of
campaign
this
godfrey
norton
was
evidently
an
important
factor
in
the
matter
he
was  lawyer
that
sounded
ominous
what
was
the
relation
between
them
and
what
the
object
of
his
repeated
visits
was
she
his
client
his
friend
or
his
mistress
if
the
former
she
had
probably
transferred
the
photograph
to
his
keeping
if
the
latter
it
was
less
likely
on
the
issue
of
this
question
depended
whether  should
continue
my
work
at
briony
lodge
or
turn
my
attention
to
the
gentleman  chambers
in
the
temple
it
was  delicate
point
and
it
widened
the
field
of
my
inquiry  fear
that  bore
you
with
these
details
but  have
to
let
you
see
my
little
difficulties
if
you
are
to
understand
the
situation  am
following
you
closely  answered  was
still
balancing
the
matter
in
my
mind
when  hansom
cab
drove
up
to
briony
lodge
and  gentleman
sprang
out
he
was  remarkably
handsome
man
dark
aquiline
and
moustached
evidently
the
man
of
whom  had
heard
he
appeared
to
be
in  great
hurry
shouted
to
the
cabman
to
wait
and
brushed
past
the
maid
who
opened
the
door
with
the
air
of  man
who
was
thoroughly
at
home
he
was
in
the
house
about
half
an
hour
and  could
catch
glimpses
of
him
in
the
windows
of
the
sitting
room
pacing
up
and
down
talking
excitedly
and
waving
his
arms
of
her  could
see
nothing
presently
he
emerged
looking
even
more
flurried
than
before
as
he
stepped
up
to
the
cab
he
pulled  gold
watch
from
his
pocket
and
looked
at
it
earnestly
drive
like
the
devil
he
shouted
first
to
gross
hankey  in
regent
street
and
then
to
the
church
of
st
monica
in
the
edgeware
road
half  guinea
if
you
do
it
in
twenty
minutes
away
they
went
and  was
just
wondering
whether  should
not
do
well
to
follow
them
when
up
the
lane
came  neat
little
landau
the
coachman
with
his
coat
only
half
buttoned
and
his
tie
under
his
ear
while
all
the
tags
of
his
harness
were
sticking
out
of
the
buckles
it
hadn  pulled
up
before
she
shot
out
of
the
hall
door
and
into
it  only
caught  glimpse
of
her
at
the
moment
but
she
was  lovely
woman
with  face
that  man
might
die
for
the
church
of
st
monica
john
she
cried
and
half  sovereign
if
you
reach
it
in
twenty
minutes
this
was
quite
too
good
to
lose
watson  was
just
balancing
whether  should
run
for
it
or
whether  should
perch
behind
her
landau
when  cab
came
through
the
street
the
driver
looked
twice
at
such  shabby
fare
but  jumped
in
before
he
could
object
the
church
of
st
monica
said  and
half  sovereign
if
you
reach
it
in
twenty
minutes
it
was
twenty
five
minutes
to
twelve
and
of
course
it
was
clear
enough
what
was
in
the
wind
my
cabby
drove
fast  don  think  ever
drove
faster
but
the
others
were
there
before
us
the
cab
and
the
landau
with
their
steaming
horses
were
in
front
of
the
door
when  arrived  paid
the
man
and
hurried
into
the
church
there
was
not  soul
there
save
the
two
whom  had
followed
and  surpliced
clergyman
who
seemed
to
be
expostulating
with
them
they
were
all
three
standing
in  knot
in
front
of
the
altar  lounged
up
the
side
aisle
like
any
other
idler
who
has
dropped
into  church
suddenly
to
my
surprise
the
three
at
the
altar
faced
round
to
me
and
godfrey
norton
came
running
as
hard
as
he
could
towards
me
thank
god
he
cried
you
ll
do
come
come
what
then  asked
come
man
come
only
three
minutes
or
it
won  be
legal  was
half
dragged
up
to
the
altar
and
before  knew
where  was  found
myself
mumbling
responses
which
were
whispered
in
my
ear
and
vouching
for
things
of
which  knew
nothing
and
generally
assisting
in
the
secure
tying
up
of
irene
adler
spinster
to
godfrey
norton
bachelor
it
was
all
done
in
an
instant
and
there
was
the
gentleman
thanking
me
on
the
one
side
and
the
lady
on
the
other
while
the
clergyman
beamed
on
me
in
front
it
was
the
most
preposterous
position
in
which  ever
found
myself
in
my
life
and
it
was
the
thought
of
it
that
started
me
laughing
just
now
it
seems
that
there
had
been
some
informality
about
their
license
that
the
clergyman
absolutely
refused
to
marry
them
without  witness
of
some
sort
and
that
my
lucky
appearance
saved
the
bridegroom
from
having
to
sally
out
into
the
streets
in
search
of  best
man
the
bride
gave
me  sovereign
and  mean
to
wear
it
on
my
watch
chain
in
memory
of
the
occasion
this
is  very
unexpected
turn
of
affairs
said  and
what
then
well  found
my
plans
very
seriously
menaced
it
looked
as
if
the
pair
might
take
an
immediate
departure
and
so
necessitate
very
prompt
and
energetic
measures
on
my
part
at
the
church
door
however
they
separated
he
driving
back
to
the
temple
and
she
to
her
own
house  shall
drive
out
in
the
park
at
five
as
usual
she
said
as
she
left
him  heard
no
more
they
drove
away
in
different
directions
and  went
off
to
make
my
own
arrangements
which
are
some
cold
beef
and  glass
of
beer
he
answered
ringing
the
bell  have
been
too
busy
to
think
of
food
and  am
likely
to
be
busier
still
this
evening
by
the
way
doctor  shall
want
your
co
operation  shall
be
delighted
you
don  mind
breaking
the
law
not
in
the
least
nor
running  chance
of
arrest
not
in  good
cause
oh
the
cause
is
excellent
then  am
your
man  was
sure
that  might
rely
on
you
but
what
is
it
you
wish
when
mrs
turner
has
brought
in
the
tray  will
make
it
clear
to
you
now
he
said
as
he
turned
hungrily
on
the
simple
fare
that
our
landlady
had
provided  must
discuss
it
while  eat
for  have
not
much
time
it
is
nearly
five
now
in
two
hours
we
must
be
on
the
scene
of
action
miss
irene
or
madame
rather
returns
from
her
drive
at
seven
we
must
be
at
briony
lodge
to
meet
her
and
what
then
you
must
leave
that
to
me  have
already
arranged
what
is
to
occur
there
is
only
one
point
on
which  must
insist
you
must
not
interfere
come
what
may
you
understand  am
to
be
neutral
to
do
nothing
whatever
there
will
probably
be
some
small
unpleasantness
do
not
join
in
it
it
will
end
in
my
being
conveyed
into
the
house
four
or
five
minutes
afterwards
the
sitting
room
window
will
open
you
are
to
station
yourself
close
to
that
open
window
yes
you
are
to
watch
me
for  will
be
visible
to
you
yes
and
when  raise
my
hand
so
you
will
throw
into
the
room
what  give
you
to
throw
and
will
at
the
same
time
raise
the
cry
of
fire
you
quite
follow
me
entirely
it
is
nothing
very
formidable
he
said
taking  long
cigar
shaped
roll
from
his
pocket
it
is
an
ordinary
plumber  smoke
rocket
fitted
with  cap
at
either
end
to
make
it
self
lighting
your
task
is
confined
to
that
when
you
raise
your
cry
of
fire
it
will
be
taken
up
by
quite  number
of
people
you
may
then
walk
to
the
end
of
the
street
and  will
rejoin
you
in
ten
minutes  hope
that  have
made
myself
clear  am
to
remain
neutral
to
get
near
the
window
to
watch
you
and
at
the
signal
to
throw
in
this
object
then
to
raise
the
cry
of
fire
and
to
wait
you
at
the
corner
of
the
street
precisely
then
you
may
entirely
rely
on
me
that
is
excellent  think
perhaps
it
is
almost
time
that  prepare
for
the
new
role  have
to
play
he
disappeared
into
his
bedroom
and
returned
in  few
minutes
in
the
character
of
an
amiable
and
simple
minded
nonconformist
clergyman
his
broad
black
hat
his
baggy
trousers
his
white
tie
his
sympathetic
smile
and
general
look
of
peering
and
benevolent
curiosity
were
such
as
mr
john
hare
alone
could
have
equalled
it
was
not
merely
that
holmes
changed
his
costume
his
expression
his
manner
his
very
soul
seemed
to
vary
with
every
fresh
part
that
he
assumed
the
stage
lost  fine
actor
even
as
science
lost
an
acute
reasoner
when
he
became  specialist
in
crime
it
was  quarter
past
six
when
we
left
baker
street
and
it
still
wanted
ten
minutes
to
the
hour
when
we
found
ourselves
in
serpentine
avenue
it
was
already
dusk
and
the
lamps
were
just
being
lighted
as
we
paced
up
and
down
in
front
of
briony
lodge
waiting
for
the
coming
of
its
occupant
the
house
was
just
such
as  had
pictured
it
from
sherlock
holmes
succinct
description
but
the
locality
appeared
to
be
less
private
than  expected
on
the
contrary
for  small
street
in  quiet
neighbourhood
it
was
remarkably
animated
there
was  group
of
shabbily
dressed
men
smoking
and
laughing
in  corner  scissors
grinder
with
his
wheel
two
guardsmen
who
were
flirting
with  nurse
girl
and
several
well
dressed
young
men
who
were
lounging
up
and
down
with
cigars
in
their
mouths
you
see
remarked
holmes
as
we
paced
to
and
fro
in
front
of
the
house
this
marriage
rather
simplifies
matters
the
photograph
becomes  double
edged
weapon
now
the
chances
are
that
she
would
be
as
averse
to
its
being
seen
by
mr
godfrey
norton
as
our
client
is
to
its
coming
to
the
eyes
of
his
princess
now
the
question
is
where
are
we
to
find
the
photograph
where
indeed
it
is
most
unlikely
that
she
carries
it
about
with
her
it
is
cabinet
size
too
large
for
easy
concealment
about  woman  dress
she
knows
that
the
king
is
capable
of
having
her
waylaid
and
searched
two
attempts
of
the
sort
have
already
been
made
we
may
take
it
then
that
she
does
not
carry
it
about
with
her
where
then
her
banker
or
her
lawyer
there
is
that
double
possibility
but  am
inclined
to
think
neither
women
are
naturally
secretive
and
they
like
to
do
their
own
secreting
why
should
she
hand
it
over
to
anyone
else
she
could
trust
her
own
guardianship
but
she
could
not
tell
what
indirect
or
political
influence
might
be
brought
to
bear
upon  business
man
besides
remember
that
she
had
resolved
to
use
it
within  few
days
it
must
be
where
she
can
lay
her
hands
upon
it
it
must
be
in
her
own
house
but
it
has
twice
been
burgled
pshaw
they
did
not
know
how
to
look
but
how
will
you
look  will
not
look
what
then  will
get
her
to
show
me
but
she
will
refuse
she
will
not
be
able
to
but  hear
the
rumble
of
wheels
it
is
her
carriage
now
carry
out
my
orders
to
the
letter
as
he
spoke
the
gleam
of
the
sidelights
of  carriage
came
round
the
curve
of
the
avenue
it
was  smart
little
landau
which
rattled
up
to
the
door
of
briony
lodge
as
it
pulled
up
one
of
the
loafing
men
at
the
corner
dashed
forward
to
open
the
door
in
the
hope
of
earning  copper
but
was
elbowed
away
by
another
loafer
who
had
rushed
up
with
the
same
intention  fierce
quarrel
broke
out
which
was
increased
by
the
two
guardsmen
who
took
sides
with
one
of
the
loungers
and
by
the
scissors
grinder
who
was
equally
hot
upon
the
other
side  blow
was
struck
and
in
an
instant
the
lady
who
had
stepped
from
her
carriage
was
the
centre
of  little
knot
of
flushed
and
struggling
men
who
struck
savagely
at
each
other
with
their
fists
and
sticks
holmes
dashed
into
the
crowd
to
protect
the
lady
but
just
as
he
reached
her
he
gave  cry
and
dropped
to
the
ground
with
the
blood
running
freely
down
his
face
at
his
fall
the
guardsmen
took
to
their
heels
in
one
direction
and
the
loungers
in
the
other
while  number
of
better
dressed
people
who
had
watched
the
scuffle
without
taking
part
in
it
crowded
in
to
help
the
lady
and
to
attend
to
the
injured
man
irene
adler
as  will
still
call
her
had
hurried
up
the
steps
but
she
stood
at
the
top
with
her
superb
figure
outlined
against
the
lights
of
the
hall
looking
back
into
the
street
is
the
poor
gentleman
much
hurt
she
asked
he
is
dead
cried
several
voices
no
no
there  life
in
him
shouted
another
but
he
ll
be
gone
before
you
can
get
him
to
hospital
he  a
brave
fellow
said  woman
they
would
have
had
the
lady  purse
and
watch
if
it
hadn  been
for
him
they
were  gang
and  rough
one
too
ah
he  breathing
now
he
can  lie
in
the
street
may
we
bring
him
in
marm
surely
bring
him
into
the
sitting
room
there
is  comfortable
sofa
this
way
please
slowly
and
solemnly
he
was
borne
into
briony
lodge
and
laid
out
in
the
principal
room
while  still
observed
the
proceedings
from
my
post
by
the
window
the
lamps
had
been
lit
but
the
blinds
had
not
been
drawn
so
that  could
see
holmes
as
he
lay
upon
the
couch  do
not
know
whether
he
was
seized
with
compunction
at
that
moment
for
the
part
he
was
playing
but  know
that  never
felt
more
heartily
ashamed
of
myself
in
my
life
than
when  saw
the
beautiful
creature
against
whom  was
conspiring
or
the
grace
and
kindliness
with
which
she
waited
upon
the
injured
man
and
yet
it
would
be
the
blackest
treachery
to
holmes
to
draw
back
now
from
the
part
which
he
had
intrusted
to
me  hardened
my
heart
and
took
the
smoke
rocket
from
under
my
ulster
after
all  thought
we
are
not
injuring
her
we
are
but
preventing
her
from
injuring
another
holmes
had
sat
up
upon
the
couch
and  saw
him
motion
like  man
who
is
in
need
of
air  maid
rushed
across
and
threw
open
the
window
at
the
same
instant  saw
him
raise
his
hand
and
at
the
signal  tossed
my
rocket
into
the
room
with  cry
of
fire
the
word
was
no
sooner
out
of
my
mouth
than
the
whole
crowd
of
spectators
well
dressed
and
ill
gentlemen
ostlers
and
servant
maids
joined
in  general
shriek
of
fire
thick
clouds
of
smoke
curled
through
the
room
and
out
at
the
open
window  caught  glimpse
of
rushing
figures
and  moment
later
the
voice
of
holmes
from
within
assuring
them
that
it
was  false
alarm
slipping
through
the
shouting
crowd  made
my
way
to
the
corner
of
the
street
and
in
ten
minutes
was
rejoiced
to
find
my
friend  arm
in
mine
and
to
get
away
from
the
scene
of
uproar
he
walked
swiftly
and
in
silence
for
some
few
minutes
until
we
had
turned
down
one
of
the
quiet
streets
which
lead
towards
the
edgeware
road
you
did
it
very
nicely
doctor
he
remarked
nothing
could
have
been
better
it
is
all
right
you
have
the
photograph  know
where
it
is
and
how
did
you
find
out
she
showed
me
as  told
you
she
would  am
still
in
the
dark  do
not
wish
to
make  mystery
said
he
laughing
the
matter
was
perfectly
simple
you
of
course
saw
that
everyone
in
the
street
was
an
accomplice
they
were
all
engaged
for
the
evening  guessed
as
much
then
when
the
row
broke
out  had  little
moist
red
paint
in
the
palm
of
my
hand  rushed
forward
fell
down
clapped
my
hand
to
my
face
and
became  piteous
spectacle
it
is
an
old
trick
that
also  could
fathom
then
they
carried
me
in
she
was
bound
to
have
me
in
what
else
could
she
do
and
into
her
sitting
room
which
was
the
very
room
which  suspected
it
lay
between
that
and
her
bedroom
and  was
determined
to
see
which
they
laid
me
on  couch  motioned
for
air
they
were
compelled
to
open
the
window
and
you
had
your
chance
how
did
that
help
you
it
was
all
important
when  woman
thinks
that
her
house
is
on
fire
her
instinct
is
at
once
to
rush
to
the
thing
which
she
values
most
it
is  perfectly
overpowering
impulse
and  have
more
than
once
taken
advantage
of
it
in
the
case
of
the
darlington
substitution
scandal
it
was
of
use
to
me
and
also
in
the
arnsworth
castle
business  married
woman
grabs
at
her
baby
an
unmarried
one
reaches
for
her
jewel
box
now
it
was
clear
to
me
that
our
lady
of
to
day
had
nothing
in
the
house
more
precious
to
her
than
what
we
are
in
quest
of
she
would
rush
to
secure
it
the
alarm
of
fire
was
admirably
done
the
smoke
and
shouting
were
enough
to
shake
nerves
of
steel
she
responded
beautifully
the
photograph
is
in  recess
behind  sliding
panel
just
above
the
right
bell
pull
she
was
there
in
an
instant
and  caught  glimpse
of
it
as
she
half
drew
it
out
when  cried
out
that
it
was  false
alarm
she
replaced
it
glanced
at
the
rocket
rushed
from
the
room
and  have
not
seen
her
since  rose
and
making
my
excuses
escaped
from
the
house  hesitated
whether
to
attempt
to
secure
the
photograph
at
once
but
the
coachman
had
come
in
and
as
he
was
watching
me
narrowly
it
seemed
safer
to
wait  little
over
precipitance
may
ruin
all
and
now  asked
our
quest
is
practically
finished  shall
call
with
the
king
to
morrow
and
with
you
if
you
care
to
come
with
us
we
will
be
shown
into
the
sitting
room
to
wait
for
the
lady
but
it
is
probable
that
when
she
comes
she
may
find
neither
us
nor
the
photograph
it
might
be  satisfaction
to
his
majesty
to
regain
it
with
his
own
hands
and
when
will
you
call
at
eight
in
the
morning
she
will
not
be
up
so
that
we
shall
have  clear
field
besides
we
must
be
prompt
for
this
marriage
may
mean  complete
change
in
her
life
and
habits  must
wire
to
the
king
without
delay
we
had
reached
baker
street
and
had
stopped
at
the
door
he
was
searching
his
pockets
for
the
key
when
someone
passing
said
good
night
mister
sherlock
holmes
there
were
several
people
on
the
pavement
at
the
time
but
the
greeting
appeared
to
come
from  slim
youth
in
an
ulster
who
had
hurried
by  ve
heard
that
voice
before
said
holmes
staring
down
the
dimly
lit
street
now  wonder
who
the
deuce
that
could
have
been
iii  slept
at
baker
street
that
night
and
we
were
engaged
upon
our
toast
and
coffee
in
the
morning
when
the
king
of
bohemia
rushed
into
the
room
you
have
really
got
it
he
cried
grasping
sherlock
holmes
by
either
shoulder
and
looking
eagerly
into
his
face
not
yet
but
you
have
hopes  have
hopes
then
come  am
all
impatience
to
be
gone
we
must
have  cab
no
my
brougham
is
waiting
then
that
will
simplify
matters
we
descended
and
started
off
once
more
for
briony
lodge
irene
adler
is
married
remarked
holmes
married
when
yesterday
but
to
whom
to
an
english
lawyer
named
norton
but
she
could
not
love
him  am
in
hopes
that
she
does
and
why
in
hopes
because
it
would
spare
your
majesty
all
fear
of
future
annoyance
if
the
lady
loves
her
husband
she
does
not
love
your
majesty
if
she
does
not
love
your
majesty
there
is
no
reason
why
she
should
interfere
with
your
majesty  plan
it
is
true
and
yet
well  wish
she
had
been
of
my
own
station
what  queen
she
would
have
made
he
relapsed
into  moody
silence
which
was
not
broken
until
we
drew
up
in
serpentine
avenue
the
door
of
briony
lodge
was
open
and
an
elderly
woman
stood
upon
the
steps
she
watched
us
with  sardonic
eye
as
we
stepped
from
the
brougham
mr
sherlock
holmes  believe
said
she  am
mr
holmes
answered
my
companion
looking
at
her
with  questioning
and
rather
startled
gaze
indeed
my
mistress
told
me
that
you
were
likely
to
call
she
left
this
morning
with
her
husband
by
the
train
from
charing
cross
for
the
continent
what
sherlock
holmes
staggered
back
white
with
chagrin
and
surprise
do
you
mean
that
she
has
left
england
never
to
return
and
the
papers
asked
the
king
hoarsely
all
is
lost
we
shall
see
he
pushed
past
the
servant
and
rushed
into
the
drawing
room
followed
by
the
king
and
myself
the
furniture
was
scattered
about
in
every
direction
with
dismantled
shelves
and
open
drawers
as
if
the
lady
had
hurriedly
ransacked
them
before
her
flight
holmes
rushed
at
the
bell
pull
tore
back  small
sliding
shutter
and
plunging
in
his
hand
pulled
out  photograph
and  letter
the
photograph
was
of
irene
adler
herself
in
evening
dress
the
letter
was
superscribed
to
sherlock
holmes
esq
to
be
left
till
called
for
my
friend
tore
it
open
and
we
all
three
read
it
together
it
was
dated
at
midnight
of
the
preceding
night
and
ran
in
this
way
my
dear
mr
sherlock
holmes
you
really
did
it
very
well
you
took
me
in
completely
until
after
the
alarm
of
fire  had
not  suspicion
but
then
when  found
how  had
betrayed
myself  began
to
think  had
been
warned
against
you
months
ago  had
been
told
that
if
the
king
employed
an
agent
it
would
certainly
be
you
and
your
address
had
been
given
me
yet
with
all
this
you
made
me
reveal
what
you
wanted
to
know
even
after  became
suspicious  found
it
hard
to
think
evil
of
such  dear
kind
old
clergyman
but
you
know  have
been
trained
as
an
actress
myself
male
costume
is
nothing
new
to
me  often
take
advantage
of
the
freedom
which
it
gives  sent
john
the
coachman
to
watch
you
ran
upstairs
got
into
my
walking
clothes
as  call
them
and
came
down
just
as
you
departed
well  followed
you
to
your
door
and
so
made
sure
that  was
really
an
object
of
interest
to
the
celebrated
mr
sherlock
holmes
then  rather
imprudently
wished
you
good
night
and
started
for
the
temple
to
see
my
husband
we
both
thought
the
best
resource
was
flight
when
pursued
by
so
formidable
an
antagonist
so
you
will
find
the
nest
empty
when
you
call
to
morrow
as
to
the
photograph
your
client
may
rest
in
peace  love
and
am
loved
by  better
man
than
he
the
king
may
do
what
he
will
without
hindrance
from
one
whom
he
has
cruelly
wronged  keep
it
only
to
safeguard
myself
and
to
preserve  weapon
which
will
always
secure
me
from
any
steps
which
he
might
take
in
the
future  leave  photograph
which
he
might
care
to
possess
and  remain
dear
mr
sherlock
holmes
very
truly
yours
irene
norton
nee
adler
what  woman
oh
what  woman
cried
the
king
of
bohemia
when
we
had
all
three
read
this
epistle
did  not
tell
you
how
quick
and
resolute
she
was
would
she
not
have
made
an
admirable
queen
is
it
not  pity
that
she
was
not
on
my
level
from
what  have
seen
of
the
lady
she
seems
indeed
to
be
on  very
different
level
to
your
majesty
said
holmes
coldly  am
sorry
that  have
not
been
able
to
bring
your
majesty  business
to  more
successful
conclusion
on
the
contrary
my
dear
sir
cried
the
king
nothing
could
be
more
successful  know
that
her
word
is
inviolate
the
photograph
is
now
as
safe
as
if
it
were
in
the
fire  am
glad
to
hear
your
majesty
say
so  am
immensely
indebted
to
you
pray
tell
me
in
what
way  can
reward
you
this
ring
he
slipped
an
emerald
snake
ring
from
his
finger
and
held
it
out
upon
the
palm
of
his
hand
your
majesty
has
something
which  should
value
even
more
highly
said
holmes
you
have
but
to
name
it
this
photograph
the
king
stared
at
him
in
amazement
irene  photograph
he
cried
certainly
if
you
wish
it  thank
your
majesty
then
there
is
no
more
to
be
done
in
the
matter  have
the
honour
to
wish
you  very
good
morning
he
bowed
and
turning
away
without
observing
the
hand
which
the
king
had
stretched
out
to
him
he
set
off
in
my
company
for
his
chambers
and
that
was
how  great
scandal
threatened
to
affect
the
kingdom
of
bohemia
and
how
the
best
plans
of
mr
sherlock
holmes
were
beaten
by  woman  wit
he
used
to
make
merry
over
the
cleverness
of
women
but  have
not
heard
him
do
it
of
late
and
when
he
speaks
of
irene
adler
or
when
he
refers
to
her
photograph
it
is
always
under
the
honourable
title
of
the
woman
adventure
ii
the
red
headed
league  had
called
upon
my
friend
mr
sherlock
holmes
one
day
in
the
autumn
of
last
year
and
found
him
in
deep
conversation
with  very
stout
florid
faced
elderly
gentleman
with
fiery
red
hair
with
an
apology
for
my
intrusion  was
about
to
withdraw
when
holmes
pulled
me
abruptly
into
the
room
and
closed
the
door
behind
me
you
could
not
possibly
have
come
at  better
time
my
dear
watson
he
said
cordially  was
afraid
that
you
were
engaged
so  am
very
much
so
then  can
wait
in
the
next
room
not
at
all
this
gentleman
mr
wilson
has
been
my
partner
and
helper
in
many
of
my
most
successful
cases
and  have
no
doubt
that
he
will
be
of
the
utmost
use
to
me
in
yours
also
the
stout
gentleman
half
rose
from
his
chair
and
gave  bob
of
greeting
with  quick
little
questioning
glance
from
his
small
fat
encircled
eyes
try
the
settee
said
holmes
relapsing
into
his
armchair
and
putting
his
fingertips
together
as
was
his
custom
when
in
judicial
moods  know
my
dear
watson
that
you
share
my
love
of
all
that
is
bizarre
and
outside
the
conventions
and
humdrum
routine
of
everyday
life
you
have
shown
your
relish
for
it
by
the
enthusiasm
which
has
prompted
you
to
chronicle
and
if
you
will
excuse
my
saying
so
somewhat
to
embellish
so
many
of
my
own
little
adventures
your
cases
have
indeed
been
of
the
greatest
interest
to
me  observed
you
will
remember
that  remarked
the
other
day
just
before
we
went
into
the
very
simple
problem
presented
by
miss
mary
sutherland
that
for
strange
effects
and
extraordinary
combinations
we
must
go
to
life
itself
which
is
always
far
more
daring
than
any
effort
of
the
imagination  proposition
which  took
the
liberty
of
doubting
you
did
doctor
but
none
the
less
you
must
come
round
to
my
view
for
otherwise  shall
keep
on
piling
fact
upon
fact
on
you
until
your
reason
breaks
down
under
them
and
acknowledges
me
to
be
right
now
mr
jabez
wilson
here
has
been
good
enough
to
call
upon
me
this
morning
and
to
begin  narrative
which
promises
to
be
one
of
the
most
singular
which  have
listened
to
for
some
time
you
have
heard
me
remark
that
the
strangest
and
most
unique
things
are
very
often
connected
not
with
the
larger
but
with
the
smaller
crimes
and
occasionally
indeed
where
there
is
room
for
doubt
whether
any
positive
crime
has
been
committed
as
far
as  have
heard
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
say
whether
the
present
case
is
an
instance
of
crime
or
not
but
the
course
of
events
is
certainly
among
the
most
singular
that  have
ever
listened
to
perhaps
mr
wilson
you
would
have
the
great
kindness
to
recommence
your
narrative  ask
you
not
merely
because
my
friend
dr
watson
has
not
heard
the
opening
part
but
also
because
the
peculiar
nature
of
the
story
makes
me
anxious
to
have
every
possible
detail
from
your
lips
as  rule
when  have
heard
some
slight
indication
of
the
course
of
events  am
able
to
guide
myself
by
the
thousands
of
other
similar
cases
which
occur
to
my
memory
in
the
present
instance  am
forced
to
admit
that
the
facts
are
to
the
best
of
my
belief
unique
the
portly
client
puffed
out
his
chest
with
an
appearance
of
some
little
pride
and
pulled  dirty
and
wrinkled
newspaper
from
the
inside
pocket
of
his
greatcoat
as
he
glanced
down
the
advertisement
column
with
his
head
thrust
forward
and
the
paper
flattened
out
upon
his
knee  took  good
look
at
the
man
and
endeavoured
after
the
fashion
of
my
companion
to
read
the
indications
which
might
be
presented
by
his
dress
or
appearance  did
not
gain
very
much
however
by
my
inspection
our
visitor
bore
every
mark
of
being
an
average
commonplace
british
tradesman
obese
pompous
and
slow
he
wore
rather
baggy
grey
shepherd  check
trousers  not
over
clean
black
frock
coat
unbuttoned
in
the
front
and  drab
waistcoat
with  heavy
brassy
albert
chain
and  square
pierced
bit
of
metal
dangling
down
as
an
ornament  frayed
top
hat
and  faded
brown
overcoat
with  wrinkled
velvet
collar
lay
upon  chair
beside
him
altogether
look
as  would
there
was
nothing
remarkable
about
the
man
save
his
blazing
red
head
and
the
expression
of
extreme
chagrin
and
discontent
upon
his
features
sherlock
holmes
quick
eye
took
in
my
occupation
and
he
shook
his
head
with  smile
as
he
noticed
my
questioning
glances
beyond
the
obvious
facts
that
he
has
at
some
time
done
manual
labour
that
he
takes
snuff
that
he
is  freemason
that
he
has
been
in
china
and
that
he
has
done  considerable
amount
of
writing
lately  can
deduce
nothing
else
mr
jabez
wilson
started
up
in
his
chair
with
his
forefinger
upon
the
paper
but
his
eyes
upon
my
companion
how
in
the
name
of
good
fortune
did
you
know
all
that
mr
holmes
he
asked
how
did
you
know
for
example
that  did
manual
labour
it  as
true
as
gospel
for  began
as  ship  carpenter
your
hands
my
dear
sir
your
right
hand
is
quite  size
larger
than
your
left
you
have
worked
with
it
and
the
muscles
are
more
developed
well
the
snuff
then
and
the
freemasonry  won  insult
your
intelligence
by
telling
you
how  read
that
especially
as
rather
against
the
strict
rules
of
your
order
you
use
an
arc
and
compass
breastpin
ah
of
course  forgot
that
but
the
writing
what
else
can
be
indicated
by
that
right
cuff
so
very
shiny
for
five
inches
and
the
left
one
with
the
smooth
patch
near
the
elbow
where
you
rest
it
upon
the
desk
well
but
china
the
fish
that
you
have
tattooed
immediately
above
your
right
wrist
could
only
have
been
done
in
china  have
made  small
study
of
tattoo
marks
and
have
even
contributed
to
the
literature
of
the
subject
that
trick
of
staining
the
fishes
scales
of  delicate
pink
is
quite
peculiar
to
china
when
in
addition  see  chinese
coin
hanging
from
your
watch
chain
the
matter
becomes
even
more
simple
mr
jabez
wilson
laughed
heavily
well  never
said
he  thought
at
first
that
you
had
done
something
clever
but  see
that
there
was
nothing
in
it
after
all  begin
to
think
watson
said
holmes
that  make  mistake
in
explaining
omne
ignotum
pro
magnifico
you
know
and
my
poor
little
reputation
such
as
it
is
will
suffer
shipwreck
if  am
so
candid
can
you
not
find
the
advertisement
mr
wilson
yes  have
got
it
now
he
answered
with
his
thick
red
finger
planted
halfway
down
the
column
here
it
is
this
is
what
began
it
all
you
just
read
it
for
yourself
sir  took
the
paper
from
him
and
read
as
follows
to
the
red
headed
league
on
account
of
the
bequest
of
the
late
ezekiah
hopkins
of
lebanon
pennsylvania  s  there
is
now
another
vacancy
open
which
entitles  member
of
the
league
to  salary
of  week
for
purely
nominal
services
all
red
headed
men
who
are
sound
in
body
and
mind
and
above
the
age
of
twenty
one
years
are
eligible
apply
in
person
on
monday
at
eleven  clock
to
duncan
ross
at
the
offices
of
the
league
pope  court
fleet
street
what
on
earth
does
this
mean  ejaculated
after  had
twice
read
over
the
extraordinary
announcement
holmes
chuckled
and
wriggled
in
his
chair
as
was
his
habit
when
in
high
spirits
it
is  little
off
the
beaten
track
isn  it
said
he
and
now
mr
wilson
off
you
go
at
scratch
and
tell
us
all
about
yourself
your
household
and
the
effect
which
this
advertisement
had
upon
your
fortunes
you
will
first
make  note
doctor
of
the
paper
and
the
date
it
is
the
morning
chronicle
of
april
just
two
months
ago
very
good
now
mr
wilson
well
it
is
just
as  have
been
telling
you
mr
sherlock
holmes
said
jabez
wilson
mopping
his
forehead  have  small
pawnbroker  business
at
coburg
square
near
the
city
it  not  very
large
affair
and
of
late
years
it
has
not
done
more
than
just
give
me  living  used
to
be
able
to
keep
two
assistants
but
now  only
keep
one
and  would
have  job
to
pay
him
but
that
he
is
willing
to
come
for
half
wages
so
as
to
learn
the
business
what
is
the
name
of
this
obliging
youth
asked
sherlock
holmes
his
name
is
vincent
spaulding
and
he  not
such  youth
either
it  hard
to
say
his
age  should
not
wish  smarter
assistant
mr
holmes
and  know
very
well
that
he
could
better
himself
and
earn
twice
what  am
able
to
give
him
but
after
all
if
he
is
satisfied
why
should  put
ideas
in
his
head
why
indeed
you
seem
most
fortunate
in
having
an
employe
who
comes
under
the
full
market
price
it
is
not  common
experience
among
employers
in
this
age  don  know
that
your
assistant
is
not
as
remarkable
as
your
advertisement
oh
he
has
his
faults
too
said
mr
wilson
never
was
such  fellow
for
photography
snapping
away
with  camera
when
he
ought
to
be
improving
his
mind
and
then
diving
down
into
the
cellar
like  rabbit
into
its
hole
to
develop
his
pictures
that
is
his
main
fault
but
on
the
whole
he  a
good
worker
there  no
vice
in
him
he
is
still
with
you  presume
yes
sir
he
and  girl
of
fourteen
who
does  bit
of
simple
cooking
and
keeps
the
place
clean
that  all  have
in
the
house
for  am  widower
and
never
had
any
family
we
live
very
quietly
sir
the
three
of
us
and
we
keep  roof
over
our
heads
and
pay
our
debts
if
we
do
nothing
more
the
first
thing
that
put
us
out
was
that
advertisement
spaulding
he
came
down
into
the
office
just
this
day
eight
weeks
with
this
very
paper
in
his
hand
and
he
says  wish
to
the
lord
mr
wilson
that  was  red
headed
man
why
that  asks
why
says
he
here  another
vacancy
on
the
league
of
the
red
headed
men
it  worth
quite  little
fortune
to
any
man
who
gets
it
and  understand
that
there
are
more
vacancies
than
there
are
men
so
that
the
trustees
are
at
their
wits
end
what
to
do
with
the
money
if
my
hair
would
only
change
colour
here  a
nice
little
crib
all
ready
for
me
to
step
into
why
what
is
it
then  asked
you
see
mr
holmes  am  very
stay
at
home
man
and
as
my
business
came
to
me
instead
of
my
having
to
go
to
it  was
often
weeks
on
end
without
putting
my
foot
over
the
door
mat
in
that
way  didn  know
much
of
what
was
going
on
outside
and  was
always
glad
of  bit
of
news
have
you
never
heard
of
the
league
of
the
red
headed
men
he
asked
with
his
eyes
open
never
why  wonder
at
that
for
you
are
eligible
yourself
for
one
of
the
vacancies
and
what
are
they
worth  asked
oh
merely  couple
of
hundred  year
but
the
work
is
slight
and
it
need
not
interfere
very
much
with
one  other
occupations
well
you
can
easily
think
that
that
made
me
prick
up
my
ears
for
the
business
has
not
been
over
good
for
some
years
and
an
extra
couple
of
hundred
would
have
been
very
handy
tell
me
all
about
it
said  well
said
he
showing
me
the
advertisement
you
can
see
for
yourself
that
the
league
has  vacancy
and
there
is
the
address
where
you
should
apply
for
particulars
as
far
as  can
make
out
the
league
was
founded
by
an
american
millionaire
ezekiah
hopkins
who
was
very
peculiar
in
his
ways
he
was
himself
red
headed
and
he
had  great
sympathy
for
all
red
headed
men
so
when
he
died
it
was
found
that
he
had
left
his
enormous
fortune
in
the
hands
of
trustees
with
instructions
to
apply
the
interest
to
the
providing
of
easy
berths
to
men
whose
hair
is
of
that
colour
from
all  hear
it
is
splendid
pay
and
very
little
to
do
but
said  there
would
be
millions
of
red
headed
men
who
would
apply
not
so
many
as
you
might
think
he
answered
you
see
it
is
really
confined
to
londoners
and
to
grown
men
this
american
had
started
from
london
when
he
was
young
and
he
wanted
to
do
the
old
town  good
turn
then
again  have
heard
it
is
no
use
your
applying
if
your
hair
is
light
red
or
dark
red
or
anything
but
real
bright
blazing
fiery
red
now
if
you
cared
to
apply
mr
wilson
you
would
just
walk
in
but
perhaps
it
would
hardly
be
worth
your
while
to
put
yourself
out
of
the
way
for
the
sake
of  few
hundred
pounds
now
it
is  fact
gentlemen
as
you
may
see
for
yourselves
that
my
hair
is
of  very
full
and
rich
tint
so
that
it
seemed
to
me
that
if
there
was
to
be
any
competition
in
the
matter  stood
as
good  chance
as
any
man
that  had
ever
met
vincent
spaulding
seemed
to
know
so
much
about
it
that  thought
he
might
prove
useful
so  just
ordered
him
to
put
up
the
shutters
for
the
day
and
to
come
right
away
with
me
he
was
very
willing
to
have  holiday
so
we
shut
the
business
up
and
started
off
for
the
address
that
was
given
us
in
the
advertisement  never
hope
to
see
such  sight
as
that
again
mr
holmes
from
north
south
east
and
west
every
man
who
had  shade
of
red
in
his
hair
had
tramped
into
the
city
to
answer
the
advertisement
fleet
street
was
choked
with
red
headed
folk
and
pope  court
looked
like  coster  orange
barrow  should
not
have
thought
there
were
so
many
in
the
whole
country
as
were
brought
together
by
that
single
advertisement
every
shade
of
colour
they
were
straw
lemon
orange
brick
irish
setter
liver
clay
but
as
spaulding
said
there
were
not
many
who
had
the
real
vivid
flame
coloured
tint
when  saw
how
many
were
waiting  would
have
given
it
up
in
despair
but
spaulding
would
not
hear
of
it
how
he
did
it  could
not
imagine
but
he
pushed
and
pulled
and
butted
until
he
got
me
through
the
crowd
and
right
up
to
the
steps
which
led
to
the
office
there
was  double
stream
upon
the
stair
some
going
up
in
hope
and
some
coming
back
dejected
but
we
wedged
in
as
well
as
we
could
and
soon
found
ourselves
in
the
office
your
experience
has
been  most
entertaining
one
remarked
holmes
as
his
client
paused
and
refreshed
his
memory
with  huge
pinch
of
snuff
pray
continue
your
very
interesting
statement
there
was
nothing
in
the
office
but  couple
of
wooden
chairs
and  deal
table
behind
which
sat  small
man
with  head
that
was
even
redder
than
mine
he
said  few
words
to
each
candidate
as
he
came
up
and
then
he
always
managed
to
find
some
fault
in
them
which
would
disqualify
them
getting  vacancy
did
not
seem
to
be
such  very
easy
matter
after
all
however
when
our
turn
came
the
little
man
was
much
more
favourable
to
me
than
to
any
of
the
others
and
he
closed
the
door
as
we
entered
so
that
he
might
have  private
word
with
us
this
is
mr
jabez
wilson
said
my
assistant
and
he
is
willing
to
fill  vacancy
in
the
league
and
he
is
admirably
suited
for
it
the
other
answered
he
has
every
requirement  cannot
recall
when  have
seen
anything
so
fine
he
took  step
backward
cocked
his
head
on
one
side
and
gazed
at
my
hair
until  felt
quite
bashful
then
suddenly
he
plunged
forward
wrung
my
hand
and
congratulated
me
warmly
on
my
success
it
would
be
injustice
to
hesitate
said
he
you
will
however  am
sure
excuse
me
for
taking
an
obvious
precaution
with
that
he
seized
my
hair
in
both
his
hands
and
tugged
until  yelled
with
the
pain
there
is
water
in
your
eyes
said
he
as
he
released
me  perceive
that
all
is
as
it
should
be
but
we
have
to
be
careful
for
we
have
twice
been
deceived
by
wigs
and
once
by
paint  could
tell
you
tales
of
cobbler  wax
which
would
disgust
you
with
human
nature
he
stepped
over
to
the
window
and
shouted
through
it
at
the
top
of
his
voice
that
the
vacancy
was
filled  groan
of
disappointment
came
up
from
below
and
the
folk
all
trooped
away
in
different
directions
until
there
was
not  red
head
to
be
seen
except
my
own
and
that
of
the
manager
my
name
said
he
is
mr
duncan
ross
and  am
myself
one
of
the
pensioners
upon
the
fund
left
by
our
noble
benefactor
are
you  married
man
mr
wilson
have
you  family  answered
that  had
not
his
face
fell
immediately
dear
me
he
said
gravely
that
is
very
serious
indeed  am
sorry
to
hear
you
say
that
the
fund
was
of
course
for
the
propagation
and
spread
of
the
red
heads
as
well
as
for
their
maintenance
it
is
exceedingly
unfortunate
that
you
should
be  bachelor
my
face
lengthened
at
this
mr
holmes
for  thought
that  was
not
to
have
the
vacancy
after
all
but
after
thinking
it
over
for  few
minutes
he
said
that
it
would
be
all
right
in
the
case
of
another
said
he
the
objection
might
be
fatal
but
we
must
stretch  point
in
favour
of  man
with
such  head
of
hair
as
yours
when
shall
you
be
able
to
enter
upon
your
new
duties
well
it
is  little
awkward
for  have  business
already
said  oh
never
mind
about
that
mr
wilson
said
vincent
spaulding  should
be
able
to
look
after
that
for
you
what
would
be
the
hours  asked
ten
to
two
now  pawnbroker  business
is
mostly
done
of
an
evening
mr
holmes
especially
thursday
and
friday
evening
which
is
just
before
pay
day
so
it
would
suit
me
very
well
to
earn  little
in
the
mornings
besides  knew
that
my
assistant
was  good
man
and
that
he
would
see
to
anything
that
turned
up
that
would
suit
me
very
well
said  and
the
pay
is  week
and
the
work
is
purely
nominal
what
do
you
call
purely
nominal
well
you
have
to
be
in
the
office
or
at
least
in
the
building
the
whole
time
if
you
leave
you
forfeit
your
whole
position
forever
the
will
is
very
clear
upon
that
point
you
don  comply
with
the
conditions
if
you
budge
from
the
office
during
that
time
it  only
four
hours  day
and  should
not
think
of
leaving
said  no
excuse
will
avail
said
mr
duncan
ross
neither
sickness
nor
business
nor
anything
else
there
you
must
stay
or
you
lose
your
billet
and
the
work
is
to
copy
out
the
encyclopaedia
britannica
there
is
the
first
volume
of
it
in
that
press
you
must
find
your
own
ink
pens
and
blotting
paper
but
we
provide
this
table
and
chair
will
you
be
ready
to
morrow
certainly  answered
then
good
bye
mr
jabez
wilson
and
let
me
congratulate
you
once
more
on
the
important
position
which
you
have
been
fortunate
enough
to
gain
he
bowed
me
out
of
the
room
and  went
home
with
my
assistant
hardly
knowing
what
to
say
or
do  was
so
pleased
at
my
own
good
fortune
well  thought
over
the
matter
all
day
and
by
evening  was
in
low
spirits
again
for  had
quite
persuaded
myself
that
the
whole
affair
must
be
some
great
hoax
or
fraud
though
what
its
object
might
be  could
not
imagine
it
seemed
altogether
past
belief
that
anyone
could
make
such  will
or
that
they
would
pay
such  sum
for
doing
anything
so
simple
as
copying
out
the
encyclopaedia
britannica
vincent
spaulding
did
what
he
could
to
cheer
me
up
but
by
bedtime  had
reasoned
myself
out
of
the
whole
thing
however
in
the
morning  determined
to
have  look
at
it
anyhow
so  bought  penny
bottle
of
ink
and
with  quill
pen
and
seven
sheets
of
foolscap
paper  started
off
for
pope  court
well
to
my
surprise
and
delight
everything
was
as
right
as
possible
the
table
was
set
out
ready
for
me
and
mr
duncan
ross
was
there
to
see
that  got
fairly
to
work
he
started
me
off
upon
the
letter  and
then
he
left
me
but
he
would
drop
in
from
time
to
time
to
see
that
all
was
right
with
me
at
two  clock
he
bade
me
good
day
complimented
me
upon
the
amount
that  had
written
and
locked
the
door
of
the
office
after
me
this
went
on
day
after
day
mr
holmes
and
on
saturday
the
manager
came
in
and
planked
down
four
golden
sovereigns
for
my
week  work
it
was
the
same
next
week
and
the
same
the
week
after
every
morning  was
there
at
ten
and
every
afternoon  left
at
two
by
degrees
mr
duncan
ross
took
to
coming
in
only
once
of  morning
and
then
after  time
he
did
not
come
in
at
all
still
of
course  never
dared
to
leave
the
room
for
an
instant
for  was
not
sure
when
he
might
come
and
the
billet
was
such  good
one
and
suited
me
so
well
that  would
not
risk
the
loss
of
it
eight
weeks
passed
away
like
this
and  had
written
about
abbots
and
archery
and
armour
and
architecture
and
attica
and
hoped
with
diligence
that  might
get
on
to
the  s
before
very
long
it
cost
me
something
in
foolscap
and  had
pretty
nearly
filled  shelf
with
my
writings
and
then
suddenly
the
whole
business
came
to
an
end
to
an
end
yes
sir
and
no
later
than
this
morning  went
to
my
work
as
usual
at
ten  clock
but
the
door
was
shut
and
locked
with  little
square
of
cardboard
hammered
on
to
the
middle
of
the
panel
with  tack
here
it
is
and
you
can
read
for
yourself
he
held
up  piece
of
white
cardboard
about
the
size
of  sheet
of
note
paper
it
read
in
this
fashion
the
red
headed
league
is
dissolved
october
sherlock
holmes
and  surveyed
this
curt
announcement
and
the
rueful
face
behind
it
until
the
comical
side
of
the
affair
so
completely
overtopped
every
other
consideration
that
we
both
burst
out
into  roar
of
laughter  cannot
see
that
there
is
anything
very
funny
cried
our
client
flushing
up
to
the
roots
of
his
flaming
head
if
you
can
do
nothing
better
than
laugh
at
me  can
go
elsewhere
no
no
cried
holmes
shoving
him
back
into
the
chair
from
which
he
had
half
risen  really
wouldn  miss
your
case
for
the
world
it
is
most
refreshingly
unusual
but
there
is
if
you
will
excuse
my
saying
so
something
just  little
funny
about
it
pray
what
steps
did
you
take
when
you
found
the
card
upon
the
door  was
staggered
sir  did
not
know
what
to
do
then  called
at
the
offices
round
but
none
of
them
seemed
to
know
anything
about
it
finally  went
to
the
landlord
who
is
an
accountant
living
on
the
ground
floor
and  asked
him
if
he
could
tell
me
what
had
become
of
the
red
headed
league
he
said
that
he
had
never
heard
of
any
such
body
then  asked
him
who
mr
duncan
ross
was
he
answered
that
the
name
was
new
to
him
well
said  the
gentleman
at
no
what
the
red
headed
man
yes
oh
said
he
his
name
was
william
morris
he
was  solicitor
and
was
using
my
room
as  temporary
convenience
until
his
new
premises
were
ready
he
moved
out
yesterday
where
could  find
him
oh
at
his
new
offices
he
did
tell
me
the
address
yes
king
edward
street
near
st
paul  i
started
off
mr
holmes
but
when  got
to
that
address
it
was  manufactory
of
artificial
knee
caps
and
no
one
in
it
had
ever
heard
of
either
mr
william
morris
or
mr
duncan
ross
and
what
did
you
do
then
asked
holmes  went
home
to
saxe
coburg
square
and  took
the
advice
of
my
assistant
but
he
could
not
help
me
in
any
way
he
could
only
say
that
if  waited  should
hear
by
post
but
that
was
not
quite
good
enough
mr
holmes  did
not
wish
to
lose
such  place
without  struggle
so
as  had
heard
that
you
were
good
enough
to
give
advice
to
poor
folk
who
were
in
need
of
it  came
right
away
to
you
and
you
did
very
wisely
said
holmes
your
case
is
an
exceedingly
remarkable
one
and  shall
be
happy
to
look
into
it
from
what
you
have
told
me  think
that
it
is
possible
that
graver
issues
hang
from
it
than
might
at
first
sight
appear
grave
enough
said
mr
jabez
wilson
why  have
lost
four
pound  week
as
far
as
you
are
personally
concerned
remarked
holmes  do
not
see
that
you
have
any
grievance
against
this
extraordinary
league
on
the
contrary
you
are
as  understand
richer
by
some
to
say
nothing
of
the
minute
knowledge
which
you
have
gained
on
every
subject
which
comes
under
the
letter  you
have
lost
nothing
by
them
no
sir
but  want
to
find
out
about
them
and
who
they
are
and
what
their
object
was
in
playing
this
prank
if
it
was  prank
upon
me
it
was  pretty
expensive
joke
for
them
for
it
cost
them
two
and
thirty
pounds
we
shall
endeavour
to
clear
up
these
points
for
you
and
first
one
or
two
questions
mr
wilson
this
assistant
of
yours
who
first
called
your
attention
to
the
advertisement
how
long
had
he
been
with
you
about  month
then
how
did
he
come
in
answer
to
an
advertisement
was
he
the
only
applicant
no  had  dozen
why
did
you
pick
him
because
he
was
handy
and
would
come
cheap
at
half
wages
in
fact
yes
what
is
he
like
this
vincent
spaulding
small
stout
built
very
quick
in
his
ways
no
hair
on
his
face
though
he  not
short
of
thirty
has  white
splash
of
acid
upon
his
forehead
holmes
sat
up
in
his
chair
in
considerable
excitement  thought
as
much
said
he
have
you
ever
observed
that
his
ears
are
pierced
for
earrings
yes
sir
he
told
me
that  gipsy
had
done
it
for
him
when
he
was  lad
hum
said
holmes
sinking
back
in
deep
thought
he
is
still
with
you
oh
yes
sir  have
only
just
left
him
and
has
your
business
been
attended
to
in
your
absence
nothing
to
complain
of
sir
there  never
very
much
to
do
of  morning
that
will
do
mr
wilson  shall
be
happy
to
give
you
an
opinion
upon
the
subject
in
the
course
of  day
or
two
to
day
is
saturday
and  hope
that
by
monday
we
may
come
to  conclusion
well
watson
said
holmes
when
our
visitor
had
left
us
what
do
you
make
of
it
all  make
nothing
of
it  answered
frankly
it
is  most
mysterious
business
as  rule
said
holmes
the
more
bizarre  thing
is
the
less
mysterious
it
proves
to
be
it
is
your
commonplace
featureless
crimes
which
are
really
puzzling
just
as  commonplace
face
is
the
most
difficult
to
identify
but  must
be
prompt
over
this
matter
what
are
you
going
to
do
then  asked
to
smoke
he
answered
it
is
quite  three
pipe
problem
and  beg
that
you
won  speak
to
me
for
fifty
minutes
he
curled
himself
up
in
his
chair
with
his
thin
knees
drawn
up
to
his
hawk
like
nose
and
there
he
sat
with
his
eyes
closed
and
his
black
clay
pipe
thrusting
out
like
the
bill
of
some
strange
bird  had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
he
had
dropped
asleep
and
indeed
was
nodding
myself
when
he
suddenly
sprang
out
of
his
chair
with
the
gesture
of  man
who
has
made
up
his
mind
and
put
his
pipe
down
upon
the
mantelpiece
sarasate
plays
at
the
st
james  hall
this
afternoon
he
remarked
what
do
you
think
watson
could
your
patients
spare
you
for  few
hours  have
nothing
to
do
to
day
my
practice
is
never
very
absorbing
then
put
on
your
hat
and
come  am
going
through
the
city
first
and
we
can
have
some
lunch
on
the
way  observe
that
there
is  good
deal
of
german
music
on
the
programme
which
is
rather
more
to
my
taste
than
italian
or
french
it
is
introspective
and  want
to
introspect
come
along
we
travelled
by
the
underground
as
far
as
aldersgate
and  short
walk
took
us
to
saxe
coburg
square
the
scene
of
the
singular
story
which
we
had
listened
to
in
the
morning
it
was  poky
little
shabby
genteel
place
where
four
lines
of
dingy
two
storied
brick
houses
looked
out
into  small
railed
in
enclosure
where  lawn
of
weedy
grass
and  few
clumps
of
faded
laurel
bushes
made  hard
fight
against  smoke
laden
and
uncongenial
atmosphere
three
gilt
balls
and  brown
board
with
jabez
wilson
in
white
letters
upon  corner
house
announced
the
place
where
our
red
headed
client
carried
on
his
business
sherlock
holmes
stopped
in
front
of
it
with
his
head
on
one
side
and
looked
it
all
over
with
his
eyes
shining
brightly
between
puckered
lids
then
he
walked
slowly
up
the
street
and
then
down
again
to
the
corner
still
looking
keenly
at
the
houses
finally
he
returned
to
the
pawnbroker  and
having
thumped
vigorously
upon
the
pavement
with
his
stick
two
or
three
times
he
went
up
to
the
door
and
knocked
it
was
instantly
opened
by  bright
looking
clean
shaven
young
fellow
who
asked
him
to
step
in
thank
you
said
holmes  only
wished
to
ask
you
how
you
would
go
from
here
to
the
strand
third
right
fourth
left
answered
the
assistant
promptly
closing
the
door
smart
fellow
that
observed
holmes
as
we
walked
away
he
is
in
my
judgment
the
fourth
smartest
man
in
london
and
for
daring  am
not
sure
that
he
has
not  claim
to
be
third  have
known
something
of
him
before
evidently
said  mr
wilson  assistant
counts
for  good
deal
in
this
mystery
of
the
red
headed
league  am
sure
that
you
inquired
your
way
merely
in
order
that
you
might
see
him
not
him
what
then
the
knees
of
his
trousers
and
what
did
you
see
what  expected
to
see
why
did
you
beat
the
pavement
my
dear
doctor
this
is  time
for
observation
not
for
talk
we
are
spies
in
an
enemy  country
we
know
something
of
saxe
coburg
square
let
us
now
explore
the
parts
which
lie
behind
it
the
road
in
which
we
found
ourselves
as
we
turned
round
the
corner
from
the
retired
saxe
coburg
square
presented
as
great  contrast
to
it
as
the
front
of  picture
does
to
the
back
it
was
one
of
the
main
arteries
which
conveyed
the
traffic
of
the
city
to
the
north
and
west
the
roadway
was
blocked
with
the
immense
stream
of
commerce
flowing
in  double
tide
inward
and
outward
while
the
footpaths
were
black
with
the
hurrying
swarm
of
pedestrians
it
was
difficult
to
realise
as
we
looked
at
the
line
of
fine
shops
and
stately
business
premises
that
they
really
abutted
on
the
other
side
upon
the
faded
and
stagnant
square
which
we
had
just
quitted
let
me
see
said
holmes
standing
at
the
corner
and
glancing
along
the
line  should
like
just
to
remember
the
order
of
the
houses
here
it
is  hobby
of
mine
to
have
an
exact
knowledge
of
london
there
is
mortimer  the
tobacconist
the
little
newspaper
shop
the
coburg
branch
of
the
city
and
suburban
bank
the
vegetarian
restaurant
and
mcfarlane  carriage
building
depot
that
carries
us
right
on
to
the
other
block
and
now
doctor
we
ve
done
our
work
so
it  time
we
had
some
play  sandwich
and  cup
of
coffee
and
then
off
to
violin
land
where
all
is
sweetness
and
delicacy
and
harmony
and
there
are
no
red
headed
clients
to
vex
us
with
their
conundrums
my
friend
was
an
enthusiastic
musician
being
himself
not
only  very
capable
performer
but  composer
of
no
ordinary
merit
all
the
afternoon
he
sat
in
the
stalls
wrapped
in
the
most
perfect
happiness
gently
waving
his
long
thin
fingers
in
time
to
the
music
while
his
gently
smiling
face
and
his
languid
dreamy
eyes
were
as
unlike
those
of
holmes
the
sleuth
hound
holmes
the
relentless
keen
witted
ready
handed
criminal
agent
as
it
was
possible
to
conceive
in
his
singular
character
the
dual
nature
alternately
asserted
itself
and
his
extreme
exactness
and
astuteness
represented
as  have
often
thought
the
reaction
against
the
poetic
and
contemplative
mood
which
occasionally
predominated
in
him
the
swing
of
his
nature
took
him
from
extreme
languor
to
devouring
energy
and
as  knew
well
he
was
never
so
truly
formidable
as
when
for
days
on
end
he
had
been
lounging
in
his
armchair
amid
his
improvisations
and
his
black
letter
editions
then
it
was
that
the
lust
of
the
chase
would
suddenly
come
upon
him
and
that
his
brilliant
reasoning
power
would
rise
to
the
level
of
intuition
until
those
who
were
unacquainted
with
his
methods
would
look
askance
at
him
as
on  man
whose
knowledge
was
not
that
of
other
mortals
when  saw
him
that
afternoon
so
enwrapped
in
the
music
at
st
james  hall  felt
that
an
evil
time
might
be
coming
upon
those
whom
he
had
set
himself
to
hunt
down
you
want
to
go
home
no
doubt
doctor
he
remarked
as
we
emerged
yes
it
would
be
as
well
and  have
some
business
to
do
which
will
take
some
hours
this
business
at
coburg
square
is
serious
why
serious  considerable
crime
is
in
contemplation  have
every
reason
to
believe
that
we
shall
be
in
time
to
stop
it
but
to
day
being
saturday
rather
complicates
matters  shall
want
your
help
to
night
at
what
time
ten
will
be
early
enough  shall
be
at
baker
street
at
ten
very
well
and  say
doctor
there
may
be
some
little
danger
so
kindly
put
your
army
revolver
in
your
pocket
he
waved
his
hand
turned
on
his
heel
and
disappeared
in
an
instant
among
the
crowd  trust
that  am
not
more
dense
than
my
neighbours
but  was
always
oppressed
with  sense
of
my
own
stupidity
in
my
dealings
with
sherlock
holmes
here  had
heard
what
he
had
heard  had
seen
what
he
had
seen
and
yet
from
his
words
it
was
evident
that
he
saw
clearly
not
only
what
had
happened
but
what
was
about
to
happen
while
to
me
the
whole
business
was
still
confused
and
grotesque
as  drove
home
to
my
house
in
kensington  thought
over
it
all
from
the
extraordinary
story
of
the
red
headed
copier
of
the
encyclopaedia
down
to
the
visit
to
saxe
coburg
square
and
the
ominous
words
with
which
he
had
parted
from
me
what
was
this
nocturnal
expedition
and
why
should  go
armed
where
were
we
going
and
what
were
we
to
do  had
the
hint
from
holmes
that
this
smooth
faced
pawnbroker  assistant
was  formidable
man  man
who
might
play  deep
game  tried
to
puzzle
it
out
but
gave
it
up
in
despair
and
set
the
matter
aside
until
night
should
bring
an
explanation
it
was  quarter
past
nine
when  started
from
home
and
made
my
way
across
the
park
and
so
through
oxford
street
to
baker
street
two
hansoms
were
standing
at
the
door
and
as  entered
the
passage  heard
the
sound
of
voices
from
above
on
entering
his
room  found
holmes
in
animated
conversation
with
two
men
one
of
whom  recognised
as
peter
jones
the
official
police
agent
while
the
other
was  long
thin
sad
faced
man
with  very
shiny
hat
and
oppressively
respectable
frock
coat
ha
our
party
is
complete
said
holmes
buttoning
up
his
pea
jacket
and
taking
his
heavy
hunting
crop
from
the
rack
watson  think
you
know
mr
jones
of
scotland
yard
let
me
introduce
you
to
mr
merryweather
who
is
to
be
our
companion
in
to
night  adventure
we
re
hunting
in
couples
again
doctor
you
see
said
jones
in
his
consequential
way
our
friend
here
is  wonderful
man
for
starting  chase
all
he
wants
is
an
old
dog
to
help
him
to
do
the
running
down  hope  wild
goose
may
not
prove
to
be
the
end
of
our
chase
observed
mr
merryweather
gloomily
you
may
place
considerable
confidence
in
mr
holmes
sir
said
the
police
agent
loftily
he
has
his
own
little
methods
which
are
if
he
won  mind
my
saying
so
just  little
too
theoretical
and
fantastic
but
he
has
the
makings
of  detective
in
him
it
is
not
too
much
to
say
that
once
or
twice
as
in
that
business
of
the
sholto
murder
and
the
agra
treasure
he
has
been
more
nearly
correct
than
the
official
force
oh
if
you
say
so
mr
jones
it
is
all
right
said
the
stranger
with
deference
still  confess
that  miss
my
rubber
it
is
the
first
saturday
night
for
seven
and
twenty
years
that  have
not
had
my
rubber  think
you
will
find
said
sherlock
holmes
that
you
will
play
for  higher
stake
to
night
than
you
have
ever
done
yet
and
that
the
play
will
be
more
exciting
for
you
mr
merryweather
the
stake
will
be
some
and
for
you
jones
it
will
be
the
man
upon
whom
you
wish
to
lay
your
hands
john
clay
the
murderer
thief
smasher
and
forger
he  a
young
man
mr
merryweather
but
he
is
at
the
head
of
his
profession
and  would
rather
have
my
bracelets
on
him
than
on
any
criminal
in
london
he  a
remarkable
man
is
young
john
clay
his
grandfather
was  royal
duke
and
he
himself
has
been
to
eton
and
oxford
his
brain
is
as
cunning
as
his
fingers
and
though
we
meet
signs
of
him
at
every
turn
we
never
know
where
to
find
the
man
himself
he
ll
crack  crib
in
scotland
one
week
and
be
raising
money
to
build
an
orphanage
in
cornwall
the
next  ve
been
on
his
track
for
years
and
have
never
set
eyes
on
him
yet  hope
that  may
have
the
pleasure
of
introducing
you
to
night  ve
had
one
or
two
little
turns
also
with
mr
john
clay
and  agree
with
you
that
he
is
at
the
head
of
his
profession
it
is
past
ten
however
and
quite
time
that
we
started
if
you
two
will
take
the
first
hansom
watson
and  will
follow
in
the
second
sherlock
holmes
was
not
very
communicative
during
the
long
drive
and
lay
back
in
the
cab
humming
the
tunes
which
he
had
heard
in
the
afternoon
we
rattled
through
an
endless
labyrinth
of
gas
lit
streets
until
we
emerged
into
farrington
street
we
are
close
there
now
my
friend
remarked
this
fellow
merryweather
is  bank
director
and
personally
interested
in
the
matter  thought
it
as
well
to
have
jones
with
us
also
he
is
not  bad
fellow
though
an
absolute
imbecile
in
his
profession
he
has
one
positive
virtue
he
is
as
brave
as  bulldog
and
as
tenacious
as  lobster
if
he
gets
his
claws
upon
anyone
here
we
are
and
they
are
waiting
for
us
we
had
reached
the
same
crowded
thoroughfare
in
which
we
had
found
ourselves
in
the
morning
our
cabs
were
dismissed
and
following
the
guidance
of
mr
merryweather
we
passed
down  narrow
passage
and
through  side
door
which
he
opened
for
us
within
there
was  small
corridor
which
ended
in  very
massive
iron
gate
this
also
was
opened
and
led
down  flight
of
winding
stone
steps
which
terminated
at
another
formidable
gate
mr
merryweather
stopped
to
light  lantern
and
then
conducted
us
down  dark
earth
smelling
passage
and
so
after
opening  third
door
into  huge
vault
or
cellar
which
was
piled
all
round
with
crates
and
massive
boxes
you
are
not
very
vulnerable
from
above
holmes
remarked
as
he
held
up
the
lantern
and
gazed
about
him
nor
from
below
said
mr
merryweather
striking
his
stick
upon
the
flags
which
lined
the
floor
why
dear
me
it
sounds
quite
hollow
he
remarked
looking
up
in
surprise  must
really
ask
you
to
be  little
more
quiet
said
holmes
severely
you
have
already
imperilled
the
whole
success
of
our
expedition
might  beg
that
you
would
have
the
goodness
to
sit
down
upon
one
of
those
boxes
and
not
to
interfere
the
solemn
mr
merryweather
perched
himself
upon  crate
with  very
injured
expression
upon
his
face
while
holmes
fell
upon
his
knees
upon
the
floor
and
with
the
lantern
and  magnifying
lens
began
to
examine
minutely
the
cracks
between
the
stones  few
seconds
sufficed
to
satisfy
him
for
he
sprang
to
his
feet
again
and
put
his
glass
in
his
pocket
we
have
at
least
an
hour
before
us
he
remarked
for
they
can
hardly
take
any
steps
until
the
good
pawnbroker
is
safely
in
bed
then
they
will
not
lose  minute
for
the
sooner
they
do
their
work
the
longer
time
they
will
have
for
their
escape
we
are
at
present
doctor
as
no
doubt
you
have
divined
in
the
cellar
of
the
city
branch
of
one
of
the
principal
london
banks
mr
merryweather
is
the
chairman
of
directors
and
he
will
explain
to
you
that
there
are
reasons
why
the
more
daring
criminals
of
london
should
take  considerable
interest
in
this
cellar
at
present
it
is
our
french
gold
whispered
the
director
we
have
had
several
warnings
that
an
attempt
might
be
made
upon
it
your
french
gold
yes
we
had
occasion
some
months
ago
to
strengthen
our
resources
and
borrowed
for
that
purpose
napoleons
from
the
bank
of
france
it
has
become
known
that
we
have
never
had
occasion
to
unpack
the
money
and
that
it
is
still
lying
in
our
cellar
the
crate
upon
which  sit
contains
napoleons
packed
between
layers
of
lead
foil
our
reserve
of
bullion
is
much
larger
at
present
than
is
usually
kept
in  single
branch
office
and
the
directors
have
had
misgivings
upon
the
subject
which
were
very
well
justified
observed
holmes
and
now
it
is
time
that
we
arranged
our
little
plans  expect
that
within
an
hour
matters
will
come
to  head
in
the
meantime
mr
merryweather
we
must
put
the
screen
over
that
dark
lantern
and
sit
in
the
dark  am
afraid
so  had
brought  pack
of
cards
in
my
pocket
and  thought
that
as
we
were  partie
carree
you
might
have
your
rubber
after
all
but  see
that
the
enemy  preparations
have
gone
so
far
that
we
cannot
risk
the
presence
of  light
and
first
of
all
we
must
choose
our
positions
these
are
daring
men
and
though
we
shall
take
them
at  disadvantage
they
may
do
us
some
harm
unless
we
are
careful  shall
stand
behind
this
crate
and
do
you
conceal
yourselves
behind
those
then
when  flash  light
upon
them
close
in
swiftly
if
they
fire
watson
have
no
compunction
about
shooting
them
down  placed
my
revolver
cocked
upon
the
top
of
the
wooden
case
behind
which  crouched
holmes
shot
the
slide
across
the
front
of
his
lantern
and
left
us
in
pitch
darkness
such
an
absolute
darkness
as  have
never
before
experienced
the
smell
of
hot
metal
remained
to
assure
us
that
the
light
was
still
there
ready
to
flash
out
at  moment  notice
to
me
with
my
nerves
worked
up
to  pitch
of
expectancy
there
was
something
depressing
and
subduing
in
the
sudden
gloom
and
in
the
cold
dank
air
of
the
vault
they
have
but
one
retreat
whispered
holmes
that
is
back
through
the
house
into
saxe
coburg
square  hope
that
you
have
done
what  asked
you
jones  have
an
inspector
and
two
officers
waiting
at
the
front
door
then
we
have
stopped
all
the
holes
and
now
we
must
be
silent
and
wait
what  time
it
seemed
from
comparing
notes
afterwards
it
was
but
an
hour
and  quarter
yet
it
appeared
to
me
that
the
night
must
have
almost
gone
and
the
dawn
be
breaking
above
us
my
limbs
were
weary
and
stiff
for  feared
to
change
my
position
yet
my
nerves
were
worked
up
to
the
highest
pitch
of
tension
and
my
hearing
was
so
acute
that  could
not
only
hear
the
gentle
breathing
of
my
companions
but  could
distinguish
the
deeper
heavier
in
breath
of
the
bulky
jones
from
the
thin
sighing
note
of
the
bank
director
from
my
position  could
look
over
the
case
in
the
direction
of
the
floor
suddenly
my
eyes
caught
the
glint
of  light
at
first
it
was
but  lurid
spark
upon
the
stone
pavement
then
it
lengthened
out
until
it
became  yellow
line
and
then
without
any
warning
or
sound  gash
seemed
to
open
and  hand
appeared  white
almost
womanly
hand
which
felt
about
in
the
centre
of
the
little
area
of
light
for  minute
or
more
the
hand
with
its
writhing
fingers
protruded
out
of
the
floor
then
it
was
withdrawn
as
suddenly
as
it
appeared
and
all
was
dark
again
save
the
single
lurid
spark
which
marked  chink
between
the
stones
its
disappearance
however
was
but
momentary
with  rending
tearing
sound
one
of
the
broad
white
stones
turned
over
upon
its
side
and
left  square
gaping
hole
through
which
streamed
the
light
of  lantern
over
the
edge
there
peeped  clean
cut
boyish
face
which
looked
keenly
about
it
and
then
with  hand
on
either
side
of
the
aperture
drew
itself
shoulder
high
and
waist
high
until
one
knee
rested
upon
the
edge
in
another
instant
he
stood
at
the
side
of
the
hole
and
was
hauling
after
him  companion
lithe
and
small
like
himself
with  pale
face
and  shock
of
very
red
hair
it  all
clear
he
whispered
have
you
the
chisel
and
the
bags
great
scott
jump
archie
jump
and  ll
swing
for
it
sherlock
holmes
had
sprung
out
and
seized
the
intruder
by
the
collar
the
other
dived
down
the
hole
and  heard
the
sound
of
rending
cloth
as
jones
clutched
at
his
skirts
the
light
flashed
upon
the
barrel
of  revolver
but
holmes
hunting
crop
came
down
on
the
man  wrist
and
the
pistol
clinked
upon
the
stone
floor
it  no
use
john
clay
said
holmes
blandly
you
have
no
chance
at
all
so  see
the
other
answered
with
the
utmost
coolness  fancy
that
my
pal
is
all
right
though  see
you
have
got
his
coat
tails
there
are
three
men
waiting
for
him
at
the
door
said
holmes
oh
indeed
you
seem
to
have
done
the
thing
very
completely  must
compliment
you
and  you
holmes
answered
your
red
headed
idea
was
very
new
and
effective
you
ll
see
your
pal
again
presently
said
jones
he  quicker
at
climbing
down
holes
than  am
just
hold
out
while  fix
the
derbies  beg
that
you
will
not
touch
me
with
your
filthy
hands
remarked
our
prisoner
as
the
handcuffs
clattered
upon
his
wrists
you
may
not
be
aware
that  have
royal
blood
in
my
veins
have
the
goodness
also
when
you
address
me
always
to
say
sir
and
please
all
right
said
jones
with  stare
and  snigger
well
would
you
please
sir
march
upstairs
where
we
can
get  cab
to
carry
your
highness
to
the
police
station
that
is
better
said
john
clay
serenely
he
made  sweeping
bow
to
the
three
of
us
and
walked
quietly
off
in
the
custody
of
the
detective
really
mr
holmes
said
mr
merryweather
as
we
followed
them
from
the
cellar  do
not
know
how
the
bank
can
thank
you
or
repay
you
there
is
no
doubt
that
you
have
detected
and
defeated
in
the
most
complete
manner
one
of
the
most
determined
attempts
at
bank
robbery
that
have
ever
come
within
my
experience  have
had
one
or
two
little
scores
of
my
own
to
settle
with
mr
john
clay
said
holmes  have
been
at
some
small
expense
over
this
matter
which  shall
expect
the
bank
to
refund
but
beyond
that  am
amply
repaid
by
having
had
an
experience
which
is
in
many
ways
unique
and
by
hearing
the
very
remarkable
narrative
of
the
red
headed
league
you
see
watson
he
explained
in
the
early
hours
of
the
morning
as
we
sat
over  glass
of
whisky
and
soda
in
baker
street
it
was
perfectly
obvious
from
the
first
that
the
only
possible
object
of
this
rather
fantastic
business
of
the
advertisement
of
the
league
and
the
copying
of
the
encyclopaedia
must
be
to
get
this
not
over
bright
pawnbroker
out
of
the
way
for  number
of
hours
every
day
it
was  curious
way
of
managing
it
but
really
it
would
be
difficult
to
suggest  better
the
method
was
no
doubt
suggested
to
clay  ingenious
mind
by
the
colour
of
his
accomplice  hair
the  week
was  lure
which
must
draw
him
and
what
was
it
to
them
who
were
playing
for
thousands
they
put
in
the
advertisement
one
rogue
has
the
temporary
office
the
other
rogue
incites
the
man
to
apply
for
it
and
together
they
manage
to
secure
his
absence
every
morning
in
the
week
from
the
time
that  heard
of
the
assistant
having
come
for
half
wages
it
was
obvious
to
me
that
he
had
some
strong
motive
for
securing
the
situation
but
how
could
you
guess
what
the
motive
was
had
there
been
women
in
the
house  should
have
suspected  mere
vulgar
intrigue
that
however
was
out
of
the
question
the
man  business
was  small
one
and
there
was
nothing
in
his
house
which
could
account
for
such
elaborate
preparations
and
such
an
expenditure
as
they
were
at
it
must
then
be
something
out
of
the
house
what
could
it
be  thought
of
the
assistant  fondness
for
photography
and
his
trick
of
vanishing
into
the
cellar
the
cellar
there
was
the
end
of
this
tangled
clue
then  made
inquiries
as
to
this
mysterious
assistant
and
found
that  had
to
deal
with
one
of
the
coolest
and
most
daring
criminals
in
london
he
was
doing
something
in
the
cellar
something
which
took
many
hours  day
for
months
on
end
what
could
it
be
once
more  could
think
of
nothing
save
that
he
was
running  tunnel
to
some
other
building
so
far  had
got
when
we
went
to
visit
the
scene
of
action  surprised
you
by
beating
upon
the
pavement
with
my
stick  was
ascertaining
whether
the
cellar
stretched
out
in
front
or
behind
it
was
not
in
front
then  rang
the
bell
and
as  hoped
the
assistant
answered
it
we
have
had
some
skirmishes
but
we
had
never
set
eyes
upon
each
other
before  hardly
looked
at
his
face
his
knees
were
what  wished
to
see
you
must
yourself
have
remarked
how
worn
wrinkled
and
stained
they
were
they
spoke
of
those
hours
of
burrowing
the
only
remaining
point
was
what
they
were
burrowing
for  walked
round
the
corner
saw
the
city
and
suburban
bank
abutted
on
our
friend  premises
and
felt
that  had
solved
my
problem
when
you
drove
home
after
the
concert  called
upon
scotland
yard
and
upon
the
chairman
of
the
bank
directors
with
the
result
that
you
have
seen
and
how
could
you
tell
that
they
would
make
their
attempt
to
night  asked
well
when
they
closed
their
league
offices
that
was  sign
that
they
cared
no
longer
about
mr
jabez
wilson  presence
in
other
words
that
they
had
completed
their
tunnel
but
it
was
essential
that
they
should
use
it
soon
as
it
might
be
discovered
or
the
bullion
might
be
removed
saturday
would
suit
them
better
than
any
other
day
as
it
would
give
them
two
days
for
their
escape
for
all
these
reasons  expected
them
to
come
to
night
you
reasoned
it
out
beautifully  exclaimed
in
unfeigned
admiration
it
is
so
long  chain
and
yet
every
link
rings
true
it
saved
me
from
ennui
he
answered
yawning
alas  already
feel
it
closing
in
upon
me
my
life
is
spent
in
one
long
effort
to
escape
from
the
commonplaces
of
existence
these
little
problems
help
me
to
do
so
and
you
are  benefactor
of
the
race
said  he
shrugged
his
shoulders
well
perhaps
after
all
it
is
of
some
little
use
he
remarked  homme  est
rien  oeuvre  est
tout
as
gustave
flaubert
wrote
to
george
sand
adventure
iii  case
of
identity
my
dear
fellow
said
sherlock
holmes
as
we
sat
on
either
side
of
the
fire
in
his
lodgings
at
baker
street
life
is
infinitely
stranger
than
anything
which
the
mind
of
man
could
invent
we
would
not
dare
to
conceive
the
things
which
are
really
mere
commonplaces
of
existence
if
we
could
fly
out
of
that
window
hand
in
hand
hover
over
this
great
city
gently
remove
the
roofs
and
peep
in
at
the
queer
things
which
are
going
on
the
strange
coincidences
the
plannings
the
cross
purposes
the
wonderful
chains
of
events
working
through
generations
and
leading
to
the
most
outre
results
it
would
make
all
fiction
with
its
conventionalities
and
foreseen
conclusions
most
stale
and
unprofitable
and
yet  am
not
convinced
of
it  answered
the
cases
which
come
to
light
in
the
papers
are
as  rule
bald
enough
and
vulgar
enough
we
have
in
our
police
reports
realism
pushed
to
its
extreme
limits
and
yet
the
result
is
it
must
be
confessed
neither
fascinating
nor
artistic  certain
selection
and
discretion
must
be
used
in
producing  realistic
effect
remarked
holmes
this
is
wanting
in
the
police
report
where
more
stress
is
laid
perhaps
upon
the
platitudes
of
the
magistrate
than
upon
the
details
which
to
an
observer
contain
the
vital
essence
of
the
whole
matter
depend
upon
it
there
is
nothing
so
unnatural
as
the
commonplace  smiled
and
shook
my
head  can
quite
understand
your
thinking
so  said
of
course
in
your
position
of
unofficial
adviser
and
helper
to
everybody
who
is
absolutely
puzzled
throughout
three
continents
you
are
brought
in
contact
with
all
that
is
strange
and
bizarre
but
here  picked
up
the
morning
paper
from
the
ground
let
us
put
it
to  practical
test
here
is
the
first
heading
upon
which  come  husband  cruelty
to
his
wife
there
is
half  column
of
print
but  know
without
reading
it
that
it
is
all
perfectly
familiar
to
me
there
is
of
course
the
other
woman
the
drink
the
push
the
blow
the
bruise
the
sympathetic
sister
or
landlady
the
crudest
of
writers
could
invent
nothing
more
crude
indeed
your
example
is
an
unfortunate
one
for
your
argument
said
holmes
taking
the
paper
and
glancing
his
eye
down
it
this
is
the
dundas
separation
case
and
as
it
happens  was
engaged
in
clearing
up
some
small
points
in
connection
with
it
the
husband
was  teetotaler
there
was
no
other
woman
and
the
conduct
complained
of
was
that
he
had
drifted
into
the
habit
of
winding
up
every
meal
by
taking
out
his
false
teeth
and
hurling
them
at
his
wife
which
you
will
allow
is
not
an
action
likely
to
occur
to
the
imagination
of
the
average
story
teller
take  pinch
of
snuff
doctor
and
acknowledge
that  have
scored
over
you
in
your
example
he
held
out
his
snuffbox
of
old
gold
with  great
amethyst
in
the
centre
of
the
lid
its
splendour
was
in
such
contrast
to
his
homely
ways
and
simple
life
that  could
not
help
commenting
upon
it
ah
said
he  forgot
that  had
not
seen
you
for
some
weeks
it
is  little
souvenir
from
the
king
of
bohemia
in
return
for
my
assistance
in
the
case
of
the
irene
adler
papers
and
the
ring  asked
glancing
at  remarkable
brilliant
which
sparkled
upon
his
finger
it
was
from
the
reigning
family
of
holland
though
the
matter
in
which  served
them
was
of
such
delicacy
that  cannot
confide
it
even
to
you
who
have
been
good
enough
to
chronicle
one
or
two
of
my
little
problems
and
have
you
any
on
hand
just
now  asked
with
interest
some
ten
or
twelve
but
none
which
present
any
feature
of
interest
they
are
important
you
understand
without
being
interesting
indeed  have
found
that
it
is
usually
in
unimportant
matters
that
there
is  field
for
the
observation
and
for
the
quick
analysis
of
cause
and
effect
which
gives
the
charm
to
an
investigation
the
larger
crimes
are
apt
to
be
the
simpler
for
the
bigger
the
crime
the
more
obvious
as  rule
is
the
motive
in
these
cases
save
for
one
rather
intricate
matter
which
has
been
referred
to
me
from
marseilles
there
is
nothing
which
presents
any
features
of
interest
it
is
possible
however
that  may
have
something
better
before
very
many
minutes
are
over
for
this
is
one
of
my
clients
or  am
much
mistaken
he
had
risen
from
his
chair
and
was
standing
between
the
parted
blinds
gazing
down
into
the
dull
neutral
tinted
london
street
looking
over
his
shoulder  saw
that
on
the
pavement
opposite
there
stood  large
woman
with  heavy
fur
boa
round
her
neck
and  large
curling
red
feather
in  broad
brimmed
hat
which
was
tilted
in  coquettish
duchess
of
devonshire
fashion
over
her
ear
from
under
this
great
panoply
she
peeped
up
in  nervous
hesitating
fashion
at
our
windows
while
her
body
oscillated
backward
and
forward
and
her
fingers
fidgeted
with
her
glove
buttons
suddenly
with  plunge
as
of
the
swimmer
who
leaves
the
bank
she
hurried
across
the
road
and
we
heard
the
sharp
clang
of
the
bell  have
seen
those
symptoms
before
said
holmes
throwing
his
cigarette
into
the
fire
oscillation
upon
the
pavement
always
means
an
affaire
de
coeur
she
would
like
advice
but
is
not
sure
that
the
matter
is
not
too
delicate
for
communication
and
yet
even
here
we
may
discriminate
when  woman
has
been
seriously
wronged
by  man
she
no
longer
oscillates
and
the
usual
symptom
is  broken
bell
wire
here
we
may
take
it
that
there
is  love
matter
but
that
the
maiden
is
not
so
much
angry
as
perplexed
or
grieved
but
here
she
comes
in
person
to
resolve
our
doubts
as
he
spoke
there
was  tap
at
the
door
and
the
boy
in
buttons
entered
to
announce
miss
mary
sutherland
while
the
lady
herself
loomed
behind
his
small
black
figure
like  full
sailed
merchant
man
behind  tiny
pilot
boat
sherlock
holmes
welcomed
her
with
the
easy
courtesy
for
which
he
was
remarkable
and
having
closed
the
door
and
bowed
her
into
an
armchair
he
looked
her
over
in
the
minute
and
yet
abstracted
fashion
which
was
peculiar
to
him
do
you
not
find
he
said
that
with
your
short
sight
it
is  little
trying
to
do
so
much
typewriting  did
at
first
she
answered
but
now  know
where
the
letters
are
without
looking
then
suddenly
realising
the
full
purport
of
his
words
she
gave  violent
start
and
looked
up
with
fear
and
astonishment
upon
her
broad
good
humoured
face
you
ve
heard
about
me
mr
holmes
she
cried
else
how
could
you
know
all
that
never
mind
said
holmes
laughing
it
is
my
business
to
know
things
perhaps  have
trained
myself
to
see
what
others
overlook
if
not
why
should
you
come
to
consult
me  came
to
you
sir
because  heard
of
you
from
mrs
etherege
whose
husband
you
found
so
easy
when
the
police
and
everyone
had
given
him
up
for
dead
oh
mr
holmes  wish
you
would
do
as
much
for
me  m
not
rich
but
still  have  hundred  year
in
my
own
right
besides
the
little
that  make
by
the
machine
and  would
give
it
all
to
know
what
has
become
of
mr
hosmer
angel
why
did
you
come
away
to
consult
me
in
such  hurry
asked
sherlock
holmes
with
his
finger
tips
together
and
his
eyes
to
the
ceiling
again  startled
look
came
over
the
somewhat
vacuous
face
of
miss
mary
sutherland
yes  did
bang
out
of
the
house
she
said
for
it
made
me
angry
to
see
the
easy
way
in
which
mr
windibank
that
is
my
father
took
it
all
he
would
not
go
to
the
police
and
he
would
not
go
to
you
and
so
at
last
as
he
would
do
nothing
and
kept
on
saying
that
there
was
no
harm
done
it
made
me
mad
and  just
on
with
my
things
and
came
right
away
to
you
your
father
said
holmes
your
stepfather
surely
since
the
name
is
different
yes
my
stepfather  call
him
father
though
it
sounds
funny
too
for
he
is
only
five
years
and
two
months
older
than
myself
and
your
mother
is
alive
oh
yes
mother
is
alive
and
well  wasn  best
pleased
mr
holmes
when
she
married
again
so
soon
after
father  death
and  man
who
was
nearly
fifteen
years
younger
than
herself
father
was  plumber
in
the
tottenham
court
road
and
he
left  tidy
business
behind
him
which
mother
carried
on
with
mr
hardy
the
foreman
but
when
mr
windibank
came
he
made
her
sell
the
business
for
he
was
very
superior
being  traveller
in
wines
they
got
for
the
goodwill
and
interest
which
wasn  near
as
much
as
father
could
have
got
if
he
had
been
alive  had
expected
to
see
sherlock
holmes
impatient
under
this
rambling
and
inconsequential
narrative
but
on
the
contrary
he
had
listened
with
the
greatest
concentration
of
attention
your
own
little
income
he
asked
does
it
come
out
of
the
business
oh
no
sir
it
is
quite
separate
and
was
left
me
by
my
uncle
ned
in
auckland
it
is
in
new
zealand
stock
paying
per
cent
two
thousand
five
hundred
pounds
was
the
amount
but  can
only
touch
the
interest
you
interest
me
extremely
said
holmes
and
since
you
draw
so
large  sum
as  hundred  year
with
what
you
earn
into
the
bargain
you
no
doubt
travel  little
and
indulge
yourself
in
every
way  believe
that  single
lady
can
get
on
very
nicely
upon
an
income
of
about  could
do
with
much
less
than
that
mr
holmes
but
you
understand
that
as
long
as  live
at
home  don  wish
to
be  burden
to
them
and
so
they
have
the
use
of
the
money
just
while  am
staying
with
them
of
course
that
is
only
just
for
the
time
mr
windibank
draws
my
interest
every
quarter
and
pays
it
over
to
mother
and  find
that  can
do
pretty
well
with
what  earn
at
typewriting
it
brings
me
twopence  sheet
and  can
often
do
from
fifteen
to
twenty
sheets
in  day
you
have
made
your
position
very
clear
to
me
said
holmes
this
is
my
friend
dr
watson
before
whom
you
can
speak
as
freely
as
before
myself
kindly
tell
us
now
all
about
your
connection
with
mr
hosmer
angel  flush
stole
over
miss
sutherland  face
and
she
picked
nervously
at
the
fringe
of
her
jacket  met
him
first
at
the
gasfitters
ball
she
said
they
used
to
send
father
tickets
when
he
was
alive
and
then
afterwards
they
remembered
us
and
sent
them
to
mother
mr
windibank
did
not
wish
us
to
go
he
never
did
wish
us
to
go
anywhere
he
would
get
quite
mad
if  wanted
so
much
as
to
join  sunday
school
treat
but
this
time  was
set
on
going
and  would
go
for
what
right
had
he
to
prevent
he
said
the
folk
were
not
fit
for
us
to
know
when
all
father  friends
were
to
be
there
and
he
said
that  had
nothing
fit
to
wear
when  had
my
purple
plush
that  had
never
so
much
as
taken
out
of
the
drawer
at
last
when
nothing
else
would
do
he
went
off
to
france
upon
the
business
of
the
firm
but
we
went
mother
and  with
mr
hardy
who
used
to
be
our
foreman
and
it
was
there  met
mr
hosmer
angel  suppose
said
holmes
that
when
mr
windibank
came
back
from
france
he
was
very
annoyed
at
your
having
gone
to
the
ball
oh
well
he
was
very
good
about
it
he
laughed  remember
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
said
there
was
no
use
denying
anything
to  woman
for
she
would
have
her
way  see
then
at
the
gasfitters
ball
you
met
as  understand  gentleman
called
mr
hosmer
angel
yes
sir  met
him
that
night
and
he
called
next
day
to
ask
if
we
had
got
home
all
safe
and
after
that
we
met
him
that
is
to
say
mr
holmes  met
him
twice
for
walks
but
after
that
father
came
back
again
and
mr
hosmer
angel
could
not
come
to
the
house
any
more
no
well
you
know
father
didn  like
anything
of
the
sort
he
wouldn  have
any
visitors
if
he
could
help
it
and
he
used
to
say
that  woman
should
be
happy
in
her
own
family
circle
but
then
as  used
to
say
to
mother  woman
wants
her
own
circle
to
begin
with
and  had
not
got
mine
yet
but
how
about
mr
hosmer
angel
did
he
make
no
attempt
to
see
you
well
father
was
going
off
to
france
again
in  week
and
hosmer
wrote
and
said
that
it
would
be
safer
and
better
not
to
see
each
other
until
he
had
gone
we
could
write
in
the
meantime
and
he
used
to
write
every
day  took
the
letters
in
in
the
morning
so
there
was
no
need
for
father
to
know
were
you
engaged
to
the
gentleman
at
this
time
oh
yes
mr
holmes
we
were
engaged
after
the
first
walk
that
we
took
hosmer
mr
angel
was  cashier
in
an
office
in
leadenhall
street
and
what
office
that  the
worst
of
it
mr
holmes  don  know
where
did
he
live
then
he
slept
on
the
premises
and
you
don  know
his
address
no
except
that
it
was
leadenhall
street
where
did
you
address
your
letters
then
to
the
leadenhall
street
post
office
to
be
left
till
called
for
he
said
that
if
they
were
sent
to
the
office
he
would
be
chaffed
by
all
the
other
clerks
about
having
letters
from  lady
so  offered
to
typewrite
them
like
he
did
his
but
he
wouldn  have
that
for
he
said
that
when  wrote
them
they
seemed
to
come
from
me
but
when
they
were
typewritten
he
always
felt
that
the
machine
had
come
between
us
that
will
just
show
you
how
fond
he
was
of
me
mr
holmes
and
the
little
things
that
he
would
think
of
it
was
most
suggestive
said
holmes
it
has
long
been
an
axiom
of
mine
that
the
little
things
are
infinitely
the
most
important
can
you
remember
any
other
little
things
about
mr
hosmer
angel
he
was  very
shy
man
mr
holmes
he
would
rather
walk
with
me
in
the
evening
than
in
the
daylight
for
he
said
that
he
hated
to
be
conspicuous
very
retiring
and
gentlemanly
he
was
even
his
voice
was
gentle
he  had
the
quinsy
and
swollen
glands
when
he
was
young
he
told
me
and
it
had
left
him
with  weak
throat
and  hesitating
whispering
fashion
of
speech
he
was
always
well
dressed
very
neat
and
plain
but
his
eyes
were
weak
just
as
mine
are
and
he
wore
tinted
glasses
against
the
glare
well
and
what
happened
when
mr
windibank
your
stepfather
returned
to
france
mr
hosmer
angel
came
to
the
house
again
and
proposed
that
we
should
marry
before
father
came
back
he
was
in
dreadful
earnest
and
made
me
swear
with
my
hands
on
the
testament
that
whatever
happened  would
always
be
true
to
him
mother
said
he
was
quite
right
to
make
me
swear
and
that
it
was  sign
of
his
passion
mother
was
all
in
his
favour
from
the
first
and
was
even
fonder
of
him
than  was
then
when
they
talked
of
marrying
within
the
week  began
to
ask
about
father
but
they
both
said
never
to
mind
about
father
but
just
to
tell
him
afterwards
and
mother
said
she
would
make
it
all
right
with
him  didn  quite
like
that
mr
holmes
it
seemed
funny
that  should
ask
his
leave
as
he
was
only  few
years
older
than
me
but  didn  want
to
do
anything
on
the
sly
so  wrote
to
father
at
bordeaux
where
the
company
has
its
french
offices
but
the
letter
came
back
to
me
on
the
very
morning
of
the
wedding
it
missed
him
then
yes
sir
for
he
had
started
to
england
just
before
it
arrived
ha
that
was
unfortunate
your
wedding
was
arranged
then
for
the
friday
was
it
to
be
in
church
yes
sir
but
very
quietly
it
was
to
be
at
st
saviour  near
king  cross
and
we
were
to
have
breakfast
afterwards
at
the
st
pancras
hotel
hosmer
came
for
us
in  hansom
but
as
there
were
two
of
us
he
put
us
both
into
it
and
stepped
himself
into  four
wheeler
which
happened
to
be
the
only
other
cab
in
the
street
we
got
to
the
church
first
and
when
the
four
wheeler
drove
up
we
waited
for
him
to
step
out
but
he
never
did
and
when
the
cabman
got
down
from
the
box
and
looked
there
was
no
one
there
the
cabman
said
that
he
could
not
imagine
what
had
become
of
him
for
he
had
seen
him
get
in
with
his
own
eyes
that
was
last
friday
mr
holmes
and  have
never
seen
or
heard
anything
since
then
to
throw
any
light
upon
what
became
of
him
it
seems
to
me
that
you
have
been
very
shamefully
treated
said
holmes
oh
no
sir
he
was
too
good
and
kind
to
leave
me
so
why
all
the
morning
he
was
saying
to
me
that
whatever
happened  was
to
be
true
and
that
even
if
something
quite
unforeseen
occurred
to
separate
us  was
always
to
remember
that  was
pledged
to
him
and
that
he
would
claim
his
pledge
sooner
or
later
it
seemed
strange
talk
for  wedding
morning
but
what
has
happened
since
gives  meaning
to
it
most
certainly
it
does
your
own
opinion
is
then
that
some
unforeseen
catastrophe
has
occurred
to
him
yes
sir  believe
that
he
foresaw
some
danger
or
else
he
would
not
have
talked
so
and
then  think
that
what
he
foresaw
happened
but
you
have
no
notion
as
to
what
it
could
have
been
none
one
more
question
how
did
your
mother
take
the
matter
she
was
angry
and
said
that  was
never
to
speak
of
the
matter
again
and
your
father
did
you
tell
him
yes
and
he
seemed
to
think
with
me
that
something
had
happened
and
that  should
hear
of
hosmer
again
as
he
said
what
interest
could
anyone
have
in
bringing
me
to
the
doors
of
the
church
and
then
leaving
me
now
if
he
had
borrowed
my
money
or
if
he
had
married
me
and
got
my
money
settled
on
him
there
might
be
some
reason
but
hosmer
was
very
independent
about
money
and
never
would
look
at  shilling
of
mine
and
yet
what
could
have
happened
and
why
could
he
not
write
oh
it
drives
me
half
mad
to
think
of
it
and  can  sleep  wink
at
night
she
pulled  little
handkerchief
out
of
her
muff
and
began
to
sob
heavily
into
it  shall
glance
into
the
case
for
you
said
holmes
rising
and  have
no
doubt
that
we
shall
reach
some
definite
result
let
the
weight
of
the
matter
rest
upon
me
now
and
do
not
let
your
mind
dwell
upon
it
further
above
all
try
to
let
mr
hosmer
angel
vanish
from
your
memory
as
he
has
done
from
your
life
then
you
don  think  ll
see
him
again  fear
not
then
what
has
happened
to
him
you
will
leave
that
question
in
my
hands  should
like
an
accurate
description
of
him
and
any
letters
of
his
which
you
can
spare  advertised
for
him
in
last
saturday  chronicle
said
she
here
is
the
slip
and
here
are
four
letters
from
him
thank
you
and
your
address
no
lyon
place
camberwell
mr
angel  address
you
never
had  understand
where
is
your
father  place
of
business
he
travels
for
westhouse
marbank
the
great
claret
importers
of
fenchurch
street
thank
you
you
have
made
your
statement
very
clearly
you
will
leave
the
papers
here
and
remember
the
advice
which  have
given
you
let
the
whole
incident
be  sealed
book
and
do
not
allow
it
to
affect
your
life
you
are
very
kind
mr
holmes
but  cannot
do
that  shall
be
true
to
hosmer
he
shall
find
me
ready
when
he
comes
back
for
all
the
preposterous
hat
and
the
vacuous
face
there
was
something
noble
in
the
simple
faith
of
our
visitor
which
compelled
our
respect
she
laid
her
little
bundle
of
papers
upon
the
table
and
went
her
way
with  promise
to
come
again
whenever
she
might
be
summoned
sherlock
holmes
sat
silent
for  few
minutes
with
his
fingertips
still
pressed
together
his
legs
stretched
out
in
front
of
him
and
his
gaze
directed
upward
to
the
ceiling
then
he
took
down
from
the
rack
the
old
and
oily
clay
pipe
which
was
to
him
as  counsellor
and
having
lit
it
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
with
the
thick
blue
cloud
wreaths
spinning
up
from
him
and  look
of
infinite
languor
in
his
face
quite
an
interesting
study
that
maiden
he
observed  found
her
more
interesting
than
her
little
problem
which
by
the
way
is
rather  trite
one
you
will
find
parallel
cases
if
you
consult
my
index
in
andover
in
and
there
was
something
of
the
sort
at
the
hague
last
year
old
as
is
the
idea
however
there
were
one
or
two
details
which
were
new
to
me
but
the
maiden
herself
was
most
instructive
you
appeared
to
read  good
deal
upon
her
which
was
quite
invisible
to
me  remarked
not
invisible
but
unnoticed
watson
you
did
not
know
where
to
look
and
so
you
missed
all
that
was
important  can
never
bring
you
to
realise
the
importance
of
sleeves
the
suggestiveness
of
thumb
nails
or
the
great
issues
that
may
hang
from  boot
lace
now
what
did
you
gather
from
that
woman  appearance
describe
it
well
she
had  slate
coloured
broad
brimmed
straw
hat
with  feather
of  brickish
red
her
jacket
was
black
with
black
beads
sewn
upon
it
and  fringe
of
little
black
jet
ornaments
her
dress
was
brown
rather
darker
than
coffee
colour
with  little
purple
plush
at
the
neck
and
sleeves
her
gloves
were
greyish
and
were
worn
through
at
the
right
forefinger
her
boots  didn  observe
she
had
small
round
hanging
gold
earrings
and  general
air
of
being
fairly
well
to
do
in  vulgar
comfortable
easy
going
way
sherlock
holmes
clapped
his
hands
softly
together
and
chuckled
pon
my
word
watson
you
are
coming
along
wonderfully
you
have
really
done
very
well
indeed
it
is
true
that
you
have
missed
everything
of
importance
but
you
have
hit
upon
the
method
and
you
have  quick
eye
for
colour
never
trust
to
general
impressions
my
boy
but
concentrate
yourself
upon
details
my
first
glance
is
always
at  woman  sleeve
in  man
it
is
perhaps
better
first
to
take
the
knee
of
the
trouser
as
you
observe
this
woman
had
plush
upon
her
sleeves
which
is  most
useful
material
for
showing
traces
the
double
line  little
above
the
wrist
where
the
typewritist
presses
against
the
table
was
beautifully
defined
the
sewing
machine
of
the
hand
type
leaves  similar
mark
but
only
on
the
left
arm
and
on
the
side
of
it
farthest
from
the
thumb
instead
of
being
right
across
the
broadest
part
as
this
was  then
glanced
at
her
face
and
observing
the
dint
of  pince
nez
at
either
side
of
her
nose  ventured  remark
upon
short
sight
and
typewriting
which
seemed
to
surprise
her
it
surprised
me
but
surely
it
was
obvious  was
then
much
surprised
and
interested
on
glancing
down
to
observe
that
though
the
boots
which
she
was
wearing
were
not
unlike
each
other
they
were
really
odd
ones
the
one
having  slightly
decorated
toe
cap
and
the
other  plain
one
one
was
buttoned
only
in
the
two
lower
buttons
out
of
five
and
the
other
at
the
first
third
and
fifth
now
when
you
see
that  young
lady
otherwise
neatly
dressed
has
come
away
from
home
with
odd
boots
half
buttoned
it
is
no
great
deduction
to
say
that
she
came
away
in  hurry
and
what
else  asked
keenly
interested
as  always
was
by
my
friend  incisive
reasoning  noted
in
passing
that
she
had
written  note
before
leaving
home
but
after
being
fully
dressed
you
observed
that
her
right
glove
was
torn
at
the
forefinger
but
you
did
not
apparently
see
that
both
glove
and
finger
were
stained
with
violet
ink
she
had
written
in  hurry
and
dipped
her
pen
too
deep
it
must
have
been
this
morning
or
the
mark
would
not
remain
clear
upon
the
finger
all
this
is
amusing
though
rather
elementary
but  must
go
back
to
business
watson
would
you
mind
reading
me
the
advertised
description
of
mr
hosmer
angel  held
the
little
printed
slip
to
the
light
missing
it
said
on
the
morning
of
the
fourteenth  gentleman
named
hosmer
angel
about
five
ft
seven
in
in
height
strongly
built
sallow
complexion
black
hair  little
bald
in
the
centre
bushy
black
side
whiskers
and
moustache
tinted
glasses
slight
infirmity
of
speech
was
dressed
when
last
seen
in
black
frock
coat
faced
with
silk
black
waistcoat
gold
albert
chain
and
grey
harris
tweed
trousers
with
brown
gaiters
over
elastic
sided
boots
known
to
have
been
employed
in
an
office
in
leadenhall
street
anybody
bringing
that
will
do
said
holmes
as
to
the
letters
he
continued
glancing
over
them
they
are
very
commonplace
absolutely
no
clue
in
them
to
mr
angel
save
that
he
quotes
balzac
once
there
is
one
remarkable
point
however
which
will
no
doubt
strike
you
they
are
typewritten  remarked
not
only
that
but
the
signature
is
typewritten
look
at
the
neat
little
hosmer
angel
at
the
bottom
there
is  date
you
see
but
no
superscription
except
leadenhall
street
which
is
rather
vague
the
point
about
the
signature
is
very
suggestive
in
fact
we
may
call
it
conclusive
of
what
my
dear
fellow
is
it
possible
you
do
not
see
how
strongly
it
bears
upon
the
case  cannot
say
that  do
unless
it
were
that
he
wished
to
be
able
to
deny
his
signature
if
an
action
for
breach
of
promise
were
instituted
no
that
was
not
the
point
however  shall
write
two
letters
which
should
settle
the
matter
one
is
to  firm
in
the
city
the
other
is
to
the
young
lady  stepfather
mr
windibank
asking
him
whether
he
could
meet
us
here
at
six  clock
to
morrow
evening
it
is
just
as
well
that
we
should
do
business
with
the
male
relatives
and
now
doctor
we
can
do
nothing
until
the
answers
to
those
letters
come
so
we
may
put
our
little
problem
upon
the
shelf
for
the
interim  had
had
so
many
reasons
to
believe
in
my
friend  subtle
powers
of
reasoning
and
extraordinary
energy
in
action
that  felt
that
he
must
have
some
solid
grounds
for
the
assured
and
easy
demeanour
with
which
he
treated
the
singular
mystery
which
he
had
been
called
upon
to
fathom
once
only
had  known
him
to
fail
in
the
case
of
the
king
of
bohemia
and
of
the
irene
adler
photograph
but
when  looked
back
to
the
weird
business
of
the
sign
of
four
and
the
extraordinary
circumstances
connected
with
the
study
in
scarlet  felt
that
it
would
be  strange
tangle
indeed
which
he
could
not
unravel  left
him
then
still
puffing
at
his
black
clay
pipe
with
the
conviction
that
when  came
again
on
the
next
evening  would
find
that
he
held
in
his
hands
all
the
clues
which
would
lead
up
to
the
identity
of
the
disappearing
bridegroom
of
miss
mary
sutherland  professional
case
of
great
gravity
was
engaging
my
own
attention
at
the
time
and
the
whole
of
next
day  was
busy
at
the
bedside
of
the
sufferer
it
was
not
until
close
upon
six  clock
that  found
myself
free
and
was
able
to
spring
into  hansom
and
drive
to
baker
street
half
afraid
that  might
be
too
late
to
assist
at
the
denouement
of
the
little
mystery  found
sherlock
holmes
alone
however
half
asleep
with
his
long
thin
form
curled
up
in
the
recesses
of
his
armchair  formidable
array
of
bottles
and
test
tubes
with
the
pungent
cleanly
smell
of
hydrochloric
acid
told
me
that
he
had
spent
his
day
in
the
chemical
work
which
was
so
dear
to
him
well
have
you
solved
it  asked
as  entered
yes
it
was
the
bisulphate
of
baryta
no
no
the
mystery  cried
oh
that  thought
of
the
salt
that  have
been
working
upon
there
was
never
any
mystery
in
the
matter
though
as  said
yesterday
some
of
the
details
are
of
interest
the
only
drawback
is
that
there
is
no
law  fear
that
can
touch
the
scoundrel
who
was
he
then
and
what
was
his
object
in
deserting
miss
sutherland
the
question
was
hardly
out
of
my
mouth
and
holmes
had
not
yet
opened
his
lips
to
reply
when
we
heard  heavy
footfall
in
the
passage
and  tap
at
the
door
this
is
the
girl  stepfather
mr
james
windibank
said
holmes
he
has
written
to
me
to
say
that
he
would
be
here
at
six
come
in
the
man
who
entered
was  sturdy
middle
sized
fellow
some
thirty
years
of
age
clean
shaven
and
sallow
skinned
with  bland
insinuating
manner
and  pair
of
wonderfully
sharp
and
penetrating
grey
eyes
he
shot  questioning
glance
at
each
of
us
placed
his
shiny
top
hat
upon
the
sideboard
and
with  slight
bow
sidled
down
into
the
nearest
chair
good
evening
mr
james
windibank
said
holmes  think
that
this
typewritten
letter
is
from
you
in
which
you
made
an
appointment
with
me
for
six  clock
yes
sir  am
afraid
that  am  little
late
but  am
not
quite
my
own
master
you
know  am
sorry
that
miss
sutherland
has
troubled
you
about
this
little
matter
for  think
it
is
far
better
not
to
wash
linen
of
the
sort
in
public
it
was
quite
against
my
wishes
that
she
came
but
she
is  very
excitable
impulsive
girl
as
you
may
have
noticed
and
she
is
not
easily
controlled
when
she
has
made
up
her
mind
on  point
of
course  did
not
mind
you
so
much
as
you
are
not
connected
with
the
official
police
but
it
is
not
pleasant
to
have  family
misfortune
like
this
noised
abroad
besides
it
is  useless
expense
for
how
could
you
possibly
find
this
hosmer
angel
on
the
contrary
said
holmes
quietly  have
every
reason
to
believe
that  will
succeed
in
discovering
mr
hosmer
angel
mr
windibank
gave  violent
start
and
dropped
his
gloves  am
delighted
to
hear
it
he
said
it
is  curious
thing
remarked
holmes
that  typewriter
has
really
quite
as
much
individuality
as  man  handwriting
unless
they
are
quite
new
no
two
of
them
write
exactly
alike
some
letters
get
more
worn
than
others
and
some
wear
only
on
one
side
now
you
remark
in
this
note
of
yours
mr
windibank
that
in
every
case
there
is
some
little
slurring
over
of
the  and  slight
defect
in
the
tail
of
the  there
are
fourteen
other
characteristics
but
those
are
the
more
obvious
we
do
all
our
correspondence
with
this
machine
at
the
office
and
no
doubt
it
is  little
worn
our
visitor
answered
glancing
keenly
at
holmes
with
his
bright
little
eyes
and
now  will
show
you
what
is
really  very
interesting
study
mr
windibank
holmes
continued  think
of
writing
another
little
monograph
some
of
these
days
on
the
typewriter
and
its
relation
to
crime
it
is  subject
to
which  have
devoted
some
little
attention  have
here
four
letters
which
purport
to
come
from
the
missing
man
they
are
all
typewritten
in
each
case
not
only
are
the  s
slurred
and
the  s
tailless
but
you
will
observe
if
you
care
to
use
my
magnifying
lens
that
the
fourteen
other
characteristics
to
which  have
alluded
are
there
as
well
mr
windibank
sprang
out
of
his
chair
and
picked
up
his
hat  cannot
waste
time
over
this
sort
of
fantastic
talk
mr
holmes
he
said
if
you
can
catch
the
man
catch
him
and
let
me
know
when
you
have
done
it
certainly
said
holmes
stepping
over
and
turning
the
key
in
the
door  let
you
know
then
that  have
caught
him
what
where
shouted
mr
windibank
turning
white
to
his
lips
and
glancing
about
him
like  rat
in  trap
oh
it
won  do
really
it
won  said
holmes
suavely
there
is
no
possible
getting
out
of
it
mr
windibank
it
is
quite
too
transparent
and
it
was  very
bad
compliment
when
you
said
that
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
solve
so
simple  question
that  right
sit
down
and
let
us
talk
it
over
our
visitor
collapsed
into  chair
with  ghastly
face
and  glitter
of
moisture
on
his
brow
it
it  not
actionable
he
stammered  am
very
much
afraid
that
it
is
not
but
between
ourselves
windibank
it
was
as
cruel
and
selfish
and
heartless  trick
in  petty
way
as
ever
came
before
me
now
let
me
just
run
over
the
course
of
events
and
you
will
contradict
me
if  go
wrong
the
man
sat
huddled
up
in
his
chair
with
his
head
sunk
upon
his
breast
like
one
who
is
utterly
crushed
holmes
stuck
his
feet
up
on
the
corner
of
the
mantelpiece
and
leaning
back
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
began
talking
rather
to
himself
as
it
seemed
than
to
us
the
man
married  woman
very
much
older
than
himself
for
her
money
said
he
and
he
enjoyed
the
use
of
the
money
of
the
daughter
as
long
as
she
lived
with
them
it
was  considerable
sum
for
people
in
their
position
and
the
loss
of
it
would
have
made  serious
difference
it
was
worth
an
effort
to
preserve
it
the
daughter
was
of  good
amiable
disposition
but
affectionate
and
warm
hearted
in
her
ways
so
that
it
was
evident
that
with
her
fair
personal
advantages
and
her
little
income
she
would
not
be
allowed
to
remain
single
long
now
her
marriage
would
mean
of
course
the
loss
of  hundred  year
so
what
does
her
stepfather
do
to
prevent
it
he
takes
the
obvious
course
of
keeping
her
at
home
and
forbidding
her
to
seek
the
company
of
people
of
her
own
age
but
soon
he
found
that
that
would
not
answer
forever
she
became
restive
insisted
upon
her
rights
and
finally
announced
her
positive
intention
of
going
to  certain
ball
what
does
her
clever
stepfather
do
then
he
conceives
an
idea
more
creditable
to
his
head
than
to
his
heart
with
the
connivance
and
assistance
of
his
wife
he
disguised
himself
covered
those
keen
eyes
with
tinted
glasses
masked
the
face
with  moustache
and  pair
of
bushy
whiskers
sunk
that
clear
voice
into
an
insinuating
whisper
and
doubly
secure
on
account
of
the
girl  short
sight
he
appears
as
mr
hosmer
angel
and
keeps
off
other
lovers
by
making
love
himself
it
was
only  joke
at
first
groaned
our
visitor
we
never
thought
that
she
would
have
been
so
carried
away
very
likely
not
however
that
may
be
the
young
lady
was
very
decidedly
carried
away
and
having
quite
made
up
her
mind
that
her
stepfather
was
in
france
the
suspicion
of
treachery
never
for
an
instant
entered
her
mind
she
was
flattered
by
the
gentleman  attentions
and
the
effect
was
increased
by
the
loudly
expressed
admiration
of
her
mother
then
mr
angel
began
to
call
for
it
was
obvious
that
the
matter
should
be
pushed
as
far
as
it
would
go
if  real
effect
were
to
be
produced
there
were
meetings
and
an
engagement
which
would
finally
secure
the
girl  affections
from
turning
towards
anyone
else
but
the
deception
could
not
be
kept
up
forever
these
pretended
journeys
to
france
were
rather
cumbrous
the
thing
to
do
was
clearly
to
bring
the
business
to
an
end
in
such  dramatic
manner
that
it
would
leave  permanent
impression
upon
the
young
lady  mind
and
prevent
her
from
looking
upon
any
other
suitor
for
some
time
to
come
hence
those
vows
of
fidelity
exacted
upon  testament
and
hence
also
the
allusions
to  possibility
of
something
happening
on
the
very
morning
of
the
wedding
james
windibank
wished
miss
sutherland
to
be
so
bound
to
hosmer
angel
and
so
uncertain
as
to
his
fate
that
for
ten
years
to
come
at
any
rate
she
would
not
listen
to
another
man
as
far
as
the
church
door
he
brought
her
and
then
as
he
could
go
no
farther
he
conveniently
vanished
away
by
the
old
trick
of
stepping
in
at
one
door
of  four
wheeler
and
out
at
the
other  think
that
was
the
chain
of
events
mr
windibank
our
visitor
had
recovered
something
of
his
assurance
while
holmes
had
been
talking
and
he
rose
from
his
chair
now
with  cold
sneer
upon
his
pale
face
it
may
be
so
or
it
may
not
mr
holmes
said
he
but
if
you
are
so
very
sharp
you
ought
to
be
sharp
enough
to
know
that
it
is
you
who
are
breaking
the
law
now
and
not
me  have
done
nothing
actionable
from
the
first
but
as
long
as
you
keep
that
door
locked
you
lay
yourself
open
to
an
action
for
assault
and
illegal
constraint
the
law
cannot
as
you
say
touch
you
said
holmes
unlocking
and
throwing
open
the
door
yet
there
never
was  man
who
deserved
punishment
more
if
the
young
lady
has  brother
or  friend
he
ought
to
lay  whip
across
your
shoulders
by
jove
he
continued
flushing
up
at
the
sight
of
the
bitter
sneer
upon
the
man  face
it
is
not
part
of
my
duties
to
my
client
but
here  a
hunting
crop
handy
and  think  shall
just
treat
myself
to
he
took
two
swift
steps
to
the
whip
but
before
he
could
grasp
it
there
was  wild
clatter
of
steps
upon
the
stairs
the
heavy
hall
door
banged
and
from
the
window
we
could
see
mr
james
windibank
running
at
the
top
of
his
speed
down
the
road
there  a
cold
blooded
scoundrel
said
holmes
laughing
as
he
threw
himself
down
into
his
chair
once
more
that
fellow
will
rise
from
crime
to
crime
until
he
does
something
very
bad
and
ends
on  gallows
the
case
has
in
some
respects
been
not
entirely
devoid
of
interest  cannot
now
entirely
see
all
the
steps
of
your
reasoning  remarked
well
of
course
it
was
obvious
from
the
first
that
this
mr
hosmer
angel
must
have
some
strong
object
for
his
curious
conduct
and
it
was
equally
clear
that
the
only
man
who
really
profited
by
the
incident
as
far
as
we
could
see
was
the
stepfather
then
the
fact
that
the
two
men
were
never
together
but
that
the
one
always
appeared
when
the
other
was
away
was
suggestive
so
were
the
tinted
spectacles
and
the
curious
voice
which
both
hinted
at  disguise
as
did
the
bushy
whiskers
my
suspicions
were
all
confirmed
by
his
peculiar
action
in
typewriting
his
signature
which
of
course
inferred
that
his
handwriting
was
so
familiar
to
her
that
she
would
recognise
even
the
smallest
sample
of
it
you
see
all
these
isolated
facts
together
with
many
minor
ones
all
pointed
in
the
same
direction
and
how
did
you
verify
them
having
once
spotted
my
man
it
was
easy
to
get
corroboration  knew
the
firm
for
which
this
man
worked
having
taken
the
printed
description  eliminated
everything
from
it
which
could
be
the
result
of  disguise
the
whiskers
the
glasses
the
voice
and  sent
it
to
the
firm
with  request
that
they
would
inform
me
whether
it
answered
to
the
description
of
any
of
their
travellers  had
already
noticed
the
peculiarities
of
the
typewriter
and  wrote
to
the
man
himself
at
his
business
address
asking
him
if
he
would
come
here
as  expected
his
reply
was
typewritten
and
revealed
the
same
trivial
but
characteristic
defects
the
same
post
brought
me  letter
from
westhouse
marbank
of
fenchurch
street
to
say
that
the
description
tallied
in
every
respect
with
that
of
their
employe
james
windibank
voila
tout
and
miss
sutherland
if  tell
her
she
will
not
believe
me
you
may
remember
the
old
persian
saying
there
is
danger
for
him
who
taketh
the
tiger
cub
and
danger
also
for
whoso
snatches  delusion
from  woman
there
is
as
much
sense
in
hafiz
as
in
horace
and
as
much
knowledge
of
the
world
adventure
iv
the
boscombe
valley
mystery
we
were
seated
at
breakfast
one
morning
my
wife
and  when
the
maid
brought
in  telegram
it
was
from
sherlock
holmes
and
ran
in
this
way
have
you  couple
of
days
to
spare
have
just
been
wired
for
from
the
west
of
england
in
connection
with
boscombe
valley
tragedy
shall
be
glad
if
you
will
come
with
me
air
and
scenery
perfect
leave
paddington
by
the
what
do
you
say
dear
said
my
wife
looking
across
at
me
will
you
go  really
don  know
what
to
say  have  fairly
long
list
at
present
oh
anstruther
would
do
your
work
for
you
you
have
been
looking  little
pale
lately  think
that
the
change
would
do
you
good
and
you
are
always
so
interested
in
mr
sherlock
holmes
cases  should
be
ungrateful
if  were
not
seeing
what  gained
through
one
of
them  answered
but
if  am
to
go  must
pack
at
once
for  have
only
half
an
hour
my
experience
of
camp
life
in
afghanistan
had
at
least
had
the
effect
of
making
me  prompt
and
ready
traveller
my
wants
were
few
and
simple
so
that
in
less
than
the
time
stated  was
in  cab
with
my
valise
rattling
away
to
paddington
station
sherlock
holmes
was
pacing
up
and
down
the
platform
his
tall
gaunt
figure
made
even
gaunter
and
taller
by
his
long
grey
travelling
cloak
and
close
fitting
cloth
cap
it
is
really
very
good
of
you
to
come
watson
said
he
it
makes  considerable
difference
to
me
having
someone
with
me
on
whom  can
thoroughly
rely
local
aid
is
always
either
worthless
or
else
biassed
if
you
will
keep
the
two
corner
seats  shall
get
the
tickets
we
had
the
carriage
to
ourselves
save
for
an
immense
litter
of
papers
which
holmes
had
brought
with
him
among
these
he
rummaged
and
read
with
intervals
of
note
taking
and
of
meditation
until
we
were
past
reading
then
he
suddenly
rolled
them
all
into  gigantic
ball
and
tossed
them
up
onto
the
rack
have
you
heard
anything
of
the
case
he
asked
not  word  have
not
seen  paper
for
some
days
the
london
press
has
not
had
very
full
accounts  have
just
been
looking
through
all
the
recent
papers
in
order
to
master
the
particulars
it
seems
from
what  gather
to
be
one
of
those
simple
cases
which
are
so
extremely
difficult
that
sounds  little
paradoxical
but
it
is
profoundly
true
singularity
is
almost
invariably  clue
the
more
featureless
and
commonplace  crime
is
the
more
difficult
it
is
to
bring
it
home
in
this
case
however
they
have
established  very
serious
case
against
the
son
of
the
murdered
man
it
is  murder
then
well
it
is
conjectured
to
be
so  shall
take
nothing
for
granted
until  have
the
opportunity
of
looking
personally
into
it  will
explain
the
state
of
things
to
you
as
far
as  have
been
able
to
understand
it
in  very
few
words
boscombe
valley
is  country
district
not
very
far
from
ross
in
herefordshire
the
largest
landed
proprietor
in
that
part
is  mr
john
turner
who
made
his
money
in
australia
and
returned
some
years
ago
to
the
old
country
one
of
the
farms
which
he
held
that
of
hatherley
was
let
to
mr
charles
mccarthy
who
was
also
an
ex
australian
the
men
had
known
each
other
in
the
colonies
so
that
it
was
not
unnatural
that
when
they
came
to
settle
down
they
should
do
so
as
near
each
other
as
possible
turner
was
apparently
the
richer
man
so
mccarthy
became
his
tenant
but
still
remained
it
seems
upon
terms
of
perfect
equality
as
they
were
frequently
together
mccarthy
had
one
son  lad
of
eighteen
and
turner
had
an
only
daughter
of
the
same
age
but
neither
of
them
had
wives
living
they
appear
to
have
avoided
the
society
of
the
neighbouring
english
families
and
to
have
led
retired
lives
though
both
the
mccarthys
were
fond
of
sport
and
were
frequently
seen
at
the
race
meetings
of
the
neighbourhood
mccarthy
kept
two
servants  man
and  girl
turner
had  considerable
household
some
half
dozen
at
the
least
that
is
as
much
as  have
been
able
to
gather
about
the
families
now
for
the
facts
on
june
rd
that
is
on
monday
last
mccarthy
left
his
house
at
hatherley
about
three
in
the
afternoon
and
walked
down
to
the
boscombe
pool
which
is  small
lake
formed
by
the
spreading
out
of
the
stream
which
runs
down
the
boscombe
valley
he
had
been
out
with
his
serving
man
in
the
morning
at
ross
and
he
had
told
the
man
that
he
must
hurry
as
he
had
an
appointment
of
importance
to
keep
at
three
from
that
appointment
he
never
came
back
alive
from
hatherley
farmhouse
to
the
boscombe
pool
is  quarter
of  mile
and
two
people
saw
him
as
he
passed
over
this
ground
one
was
an
old
woman
whose
name
is
not
mentioned
and
the
other
was
william
crowder  game
keeper
in
the
employ
of
mr
turner
both
these
witnesses
depose
that
mr
mccarthy
was
walking
alone
the
game
keeper
adds
that
within  few
minutes
of
his
seeing
mr
mccarthy
pass
he
had
seen
his
son
mr
james
mccarthy
going
the
same
way
with  gun
under
his
arm
to
the
best
of
his
belief
the
father
was
actually
in
sight
at
the
time
and
the
son
was
following
him
he
thought
no
more
of
the
matter
until
he
heard
in
the
evening
of
the
tragedy
that
had
occurred
the
two
mccarthys
were
seen
after
the
time
when
william
crowder
the
game
keeper
lost
sight
of
them
the
boscombe
pool
is
thickly
wooded
round
with
just  fringe
of
grass
and
of
reeds
round
the
edge  girl
of
fourteen
patience
moran
who
is
the
daughter
of
the
lodge
keeper
of
the
boscombe
valley
estate
was
in
one
of
the
woods
picking
flowers
she
states
that
while
she
was
there
she
saw
at
the
border
of
the
wood
and
close
by
the
lake
mr
mccarthy
and
his
son
and
that
they
appeared
to
be
having  violent
quarrel
she
heard
mr
mccarthy
the
elder
using
very
strong
language
to
his
son
and
she
saw
the
latter
raise
up
his
hand
as
if
to
strike
his
father
she
was
so
frightened
by
their
violence
that
she
ran
away
and
told
her
mother
when
she
reached
home
that
she
had
left
the
two
mccarthys
quarrelling
near
boscombe
pool
and
that
she
was
afraid
that
they
were
going
to
fight
she
had
hardly
said
the
words
when
young
mr
mccarthy
came
running
up
to
the
lodge
to
say
that
he
had
found
his
father
dead
in
the
wood
and
to
ask
for
the
help
of
the
lodge
keeper
he
was
much
excited
without
either
his
gun
or
his
hat
and
his
right
hand
and
sleeve
were
observed
to
be
stained
with
fresh
blood
on
following
him
they
found
the
dead
body
stretched
out
upon
the
grass
beside
the
pool
the
head
had
been
beaten
in
by
repeated
blows
of
some
heavy
and
blunt
weapon
the
injuries
were
such
as
might
very
well
have
been
inflicted
by
the
butt
end
of
his
son  gun
which
was
found
lying
on
the
grass
within  few
paces
of
the
body
under
these
circumstances
the
young
man
was
instantly
arrested
and  verdict
of
wilful
murder
having
been
returned
at
the
inquest
on
tuesday
he
was
on
wednesday
brought
before
the
magistrates
at
ross
who
have
referred
the
case
to
the
next
assizes
those
are
the
main
facts
of
the
case
as
they
came
out
before
the
coroner
and
the
police
court  could
hardly
imagine  more
damning
case  remarked
if
ever
circumstantial
evidence
pointed
to  criminal
it
does
so
here
circumstantial
evidence
is  very
tricky
thing
answered
holmes
thoughtfully
it
may
seem
to
point
very
straight
to
one
thing
but
if
you
shift
your
own
point
of
view  little
you
may
find
it
pointing
in
an
equally
uncompromising
manner
to
something
entirely
different
it
must
be
confessed
however
that
the
case
looks
exceedingly
grave
against
the
young
man
and
it
is
very
possible
that
he
is
indeed
the
culprit
there
are
several
people
in
the
neighbourhood
however
and
among
them
miss
turner
the
daughter
of
the
neighbouring
landowner
who
believe
in
his
innocence
and
who
have
retained
lestrade
whom
you
may
recollect
in
connection
with
the
study
in
scarlet
to
work
out
the
case
in
his
interest
lestrade
being
rather
puzzled
has
referred
the
case
to
me
and
hence
it
is
that
two
middle
aged
gentlemen
are
flying
westward
at
fifty
miles
an
hour
instead
of
quietly
digesting
their
breakfasts
at
home  am
afraid
said  that
the
facts
are
so
obvious
that
you
will
find
little
credit
to
be
gained
out
of
this
case
there
is
nothing
more
deceptive
than
an
obvious
fact
he
answered
laughing
besides
we
may
chance
to
hit
upon
some
other
obvious
facts
which
may
have
been
by
no
means
obvious
to
mr
lestrade
you
know
me
too
well
to
think
that  am
boasting
when  say
that  shall
either
confirm
or
destroy
his
theory
by
means
which
he
is
quite
incapable
of
employing
or
even
of
understanding
to
take
the
first
example
to
hand  very
clearly
perceive
that
in
your
bedroom
the
window
is
upon
the
right
hand
side
and
yet  question
whether
mr
lestrade
would
have
noted
even
so
self
evident  thing
as
that
how
on
earth
my
dear
fellow  know
you
well  know
the
military
neatness
which
characterises
you
you
shave
every
morning
and
in
this
season
you
shave
by
the
sunlight
but
since
your
shaving
is
less
and
less
complete
as
we
get
farther
back
on
the
left
side
until
it
becomes
positively
slovenly
as
we
get
round
the
angle
of
the
jaw
it
is
surely
very
clear
that
that
side
is
less
illuminated
than
the
other  could
not
imagine  man
of
your
habits
looking
at
himself
in
an
equal
light
and
being
satisfied
with
such  result  only
quote
this
as  trivial
example
of
observation
and
inference
therein
lies
my
metier
and
it
is
just
possible
that
it
may
be
of
some
service
in
the
investigation
which
lies
before
us
there
are
one
or
two
minor
points
which
were
brought
out
in
the
inquest
and
which
are
worth
considering
what
are
they
it
appears
that
his
arrest
did
not
take
place
at
once
but
after
the
return
to
hatherley
farm
on
the
inspector
of
constabulary
informing
him
that
he
was  prisoner
he
remarked
that
he
was
not
surprised
to
hear
it
and
that
it
was
no
more
than
his
deserts
this
observation
of
his
had
the
natural
effect
of
removing
any
traces
of
doubt
which
might
have
remained
in
the
minds
of
the
coroner  jury
it
was  confession  ejaculated
no
for
it
was
followed
by  protestation
of
innocence
coming
on
the
top
of
such  damning
series
of
events
it
was
at
least  most
suspicious
remark
on
the
contrary
said
holmes
it
is
the
brightest
rift
which  can
at
present
see
in
the
clouds
however
innocent
he
might
be
he
could
not
be
such
an
absolute
imbecile
as
not
to
see
that
the
circumstances
were
very
black
against
him
had
he
appeared
surprised
at
his
own
arrest
or
feigned
indignation
at
it  should
have
looked
upon
it
as
highly
suspicious
because
such
surprise
or
anger
would
not
be
natural
under
the
circumstances
and
yet
might
appear
to
be
the
best
policy
to  scheming
man
his
frank
acceptance
of
the
situation
marks
him
as
either
an
innocent
man
or
else
as  man
of
considerable
self
restraint
and
firmness
as
to
his
remark
about
his
deserts
it
was
also
not
unnatural
if
you
consider
that
he
stood
beside
the
dead
body
of
his
father
and
that
there
is
no
doubt
that
he
had
that
very
day
so
far
forgotten
his
filial
duty
as
to
bandy
words
with
him
and
even
according
to
the
little
girl
whose
evidence
is
so
important
to
raise
his
hand
as
if
to
strike
him
the
self
reproach
and
contrition
which
are
displayed
in
his
remark
appear
to
me
to
be
the
signs
of  healthy
mind
rather
than
of  guilty
one  shook
my
head
many
men
have
been
hanged
on
far
slighter
evidence  remarked
so
they
have
and
many
men
have
been
wrongfully
hanged
what
is
the
young
man  own
account
of
the
matter
it
is  am
afraid
not
very
encouraging
to
his
supporters
though
there
are
one
or
two
points
in
it
which
are
suggestive
you
will
find
it
here
and
may
read
it
for
yourself
he
picked
out
from
his
bundle  copy
of
the
local
herefordshire
paper
and
having
turned
down
the
sheet
he
pointed
out
the
paragraph
in
which
the
unfortunate
young
man
had
given
his
own
statement
of
what
had
occurred  settled
myself
down
in
the
corner
of
the
carriage
and
read
it
very
carefully
it
ran
in
this
way
mr
james
mccarthy
the
only
son
of
the
deceased
was
then
called
and
gave
evidence
as
follows  had
been
away
from
home
for
three
days
at
bristol
and
had
only
just
returned
upon
the
morning
of
last
monday
the
rd
my
father
was
absent
from
home
at
the
time
of
my
arrival
and  was
informed
by
the
maid
that
he
had
driven
over
to
ross
with
john
cobb
the
groom
shortly
after
my
return  heard
the
wheels
of
his
trap
in
the
yard
and
looking
out
of
my
window  saw
him
get
out
and
walk
rapidly
out
of
the
yard
though  was
not
aware
in
which
direction
he
was
going  then
took
my
gun
and
strolled
out
in
the
direction
of
the
boscombe
pool
with
the
intention
of
visiting
the
rabbit
warren
which
is
upon
the
other
side
on
my
way  saw
william
crowder
the
game
keeper
as
he
had
stated
in
his
evidence
but
he
is
mistaken
in
thinking
that  was
following
my
father  had
no
idea
that
he
was
in
front
of
me
when
about  hundred
yards
from
the
pool  heard  cry
of
cooee
which
was  usual
signal
between
my
father
and
myself  then
hurried
forward
and
found
him
standing
by
the
pool
he
appeared
to
be
much
surprised
at
seeing
me
and
asked
me
rather
roughly
what  was
doing
there  conversation
ensued
which
led
to
high
words
and
almost
to
blows
for
my
father
was  man
of  very
violent
temper
seeing
that
his
passion
was
becoming
ungovernable  left
him
and
returned
towards
hatherley
farm  had
not
gone
more
than
yards
however
when  heard  hideous
outcry
behind
me
which
caused
me
to
run
back
again  found
my
father
expiring
upon
the
ground
with
his
head
terribly
injured  dropped
my
gun
and
held
him
in
my
arms
but
he
almost
instantly
expired  knelt
beside
him
for
some
minutes
and
then
made
my
way
to
mr
turner  lodge
keeper
his
house
being
the
nearest
to
ask
for
assistance  saw
no
one
near
my
father
when  returned
and  have
no
idea
how
he
came
by
his
injuries
he
was
not  popular
man
being
somewhat
cold
and
forbidding
in
his
manners
but
he
had
as
far
as  know
no
active
enemies  know
nothing
further
of
the
matter
the
coroner
did
your
father
make
any
statement
to
you
before
he
died
witness
he
mumbled  few
words
but  could
only
catch
some
allusion
to  rat
the
coroner
what
did
you
understand
by
that
witness
it
conveyed
no
meaning
to
me  thought
that
he
was
delirious
the
coroner
what
was
the
point
upon
which
you
and
your
father
had
this
final
quarrel
witness  should
prefer
not
to
answer
the
coroner  am
afraid
that  must
press
it
witness
it
is
really
impossible
for
me
to
tell
you  can
assure
you
that
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
sad
tragedy
which
followed
the
coroner
that
is
for
the
court
to
decide  need
not
point
out
to
you
that
your
refusal
to
answer
will
prejudice
your
case
considerably
in
any
future
proceedings
which
may
arise
witness  must
still
refuse
the
coroner  understand
that
the
cry
of
cooee
was  common
signal
between
you
and
your
father
witness
it
was
the
coroner
how
was
it
then
that
he
uttered
it
before
he
saw
you
and
before
he
even
knew
that
you
had
returned
from
bristol
witness
with
considerable
confusion  do
not
know  juryman
did
you
see
nothing
which
aroused
your
suspicions
when
you
returned
on
hearing
the
cry
and
found
your
father
fatally
injured
witness
nothing
definite
the
coroner
what
do
you
mean
witness  was
so
disturbed
and
excited
as  rushed
out
into
the
open
that  could
think
of
nothing
except
of
my
father
yet  have  vague
impression
that
as  ran
forward
something
lay
upon
the
ground
to
the
left
of
me
it
seemed
to
me
to
be
something
grey
in
colour  coat
of
some
sort
or  plaid
perhaps
when  rose
from
my
father  looked
round
for
it
but
it
was
gone
do
you
mean
that
it
disappeared
before
you
went
for
help
yes
it
was
gone
you
cannot
say
what
it
was
no  had  feeling
something
was
there
how
far
from
the
body  dozen
yards
or
so
and
how
far
from
the
edge
of
the
wood
about
the
same
then
if
it
was
removed
it
was
while
you
were
within  dozen
yards
of
it
yes
but
with
my
back
towards
it
this
concluded
the
examination
of
the
witness  see
said  as  glanced
down
the
column
that
the
coroner
in
his
concluding
remarks
was
rather
severe
upon
young
mccarthy
he
calls
attention
and
with
reason
to
the
discrepancy
about
his
father
having
signalled
to
him
before
seeing
him
also
to
his
refusal
to
give
details
of
his
conversation
with
his
father
and
his
singular
account
of
his
father  dying
words
they
are
all
as
he
remarks
very
much
against
the
son
holmes
laughed
softly
to
himself
and
stretched
himself
out
upon
the
cushioned
seat
both
you
and
the
coroner
have
been
at
some
pains
said
he
to
single
out
the
very
strongest
points
in
the
young
man  favour
don  you
see
that
you
alternately
give
him
credit
for
having
too
much
imagination
and
too
little
too
little
if
he
could
not
invent  cause
of
quarrel
which
would
give
him
the
sympathy
of
the
jury
too
much
if
he
evolved
from
his
own
inner
consciousness
anything
so
outre
as  dying
reference
to  rat
and
the
incident
of
the
vanishing
cloth
no
sir  shall
approach
this
case
from
the
point
of
view
that
what
this
young
man
says
is
true
and
we
shall
see
whither
that
hypothesis
will
lead
us
and
now
here
is
my
pocket
petrarch
and
not
another
word
shall  say
of
this
case
until
we
are
on
the
scene
of
action
we
lunch
at
swindon
and  see
that
we
shall
be
there
in
twenty
minutes
it
was
nearly
four  clock
when
we
at
last
after
passing
through
the
beautiful
stroud
valley
and
over
the
broad
gleaming
severn
found
ourselves
at
the
pretty
little
country
town
of
ross  lean
ferret
like
man
furtive
and
sly
looking
was
waiting
for
us
upon
the
platform
in
spite
of
the
light
brown
dustcoat
and
leather
leggings
which
he
wore
in
deference
to
his
rustic
surroundings  had
no
difficulty
in
recognising
lestrade
of
scotland
yard
with
him
we
drove
to
the
hereford
arms
where  room
had
already
been
engaged
for
us  have
ordered  carriage
said
lestrade
as
we
sat
over  cup
of
tea  knew
your
energetic
nature
and
that
you
would
not
be
happy
until
you
had
been
on
the
scene
of
the
crime
it
was
very
nice
and
complimentary
of
you
holmes
answered
it
is
entirely  question
of
barometric
pressure
lestrade
looked
startled  do
not
quite
follow
he
said
how
is
the
glass
twenty
nine  see
no
wind
and
not  cloud
in
the
sky  have  caseful
of
cigarettes
here
which
need
smoking
and
the
sofa
is
very
much
superior
to
the
usual
country
hotel
abomination  do
not
think
that
it
is
probable
that  shall
use
the
carriage
to
night
lestrade
laughed
indulgently
you
have
no
doubt
already
formed
your
conclusions
from
the
newspapers
he
said
the
case
is
as
plain
as  pikestaff
and
the
more
one
goes
into
it
the
plainer
it
becomes
still
of
course
one
can  refuse  lady
and
such  very
positive
one
too
she
has
heard
of
you
and
would
have
your
opinion
though  repeatedly
told
her
that
there
was
nothing
which
you
could
do
which  had
not
already
done
why
bless
my
soul
here
is
her
carriage
at
the
door
he
had
hardly
spoken
before
there
rushed
into
the
room
one
of
the
most
lovely
young
women
that  have
ever
seen
in
my
life
her
violet
eyes
shining
her
lips
parted  pink
flush
upon
her
cheeks
all
thought
of
her
natural
reserve
lost
in
her
overpowering
excitement
and
concern
oh
mr
sherlock
holmes
she
cried
glancing
from
one
to
the
other
of
us
and
finally
with  woman  quick
intuition
fastening
upon
my
companion  am
so
glad
that
you
have
come  have
driven
down
to
tell
you
so  know
that
james
didn  do
it  know
it
and  want
you
to
start
upon
your
work
knowing
it
too
never
let
yourself
doubt
upon
that
point
we
have
known
each
other
since
we
were
little
children
and  know
his
faults
as
no
one
else
does
but
he
is
too
tender
hearted
to
hurt  fly
such  charge
is
absurd
to
anyone
who
really
knows
him  hope
we
may
clear
him
miss
turner
said
sherlock
holmes
you
may
rely
upon
my
doing
all
that  can
but
you
have
read
the
evidence
you
have
formed
some
conclusion
do
you
not
see
some
loophole
some
flaw
do
you
not
yourself
think
that
he
is
innocent  think
that
it
is
very
probable
there
now
she
cried
throwing
back
her
head
and
looking
defiantly
at
lestrade
you
hear
he
gives
me
hopes
lestrade
shrugged
his
shoulders  am
afraid
that
my
colleague
has
been  little
quick
in
forming
his
conclusions
he
said
but
he
is
right
oh  know
that
he
is
right
james
never
did
it
and
about
his
quarrel
with
his
father  am
sure
that
the
reason
why
he
would
not
speak
about
it
to
the
coroner
was
because  was
concerned
in
it
in
what
way
asked
holmes
it
is
no
time
for
me
to
hide
anything
james
and
his
father
had
many
disagreements
about
me
mr
mccarthy
was
very
anxious
that
there
should
be  marriage
between
us
james
and  have
always
loved
each
other
as
brother
and
sister
but
of
course
he
is
young
and
has
seen
very
little
of
life
yet
and
and
well
he
naturally
did
not
wish
to
do
anything
like
that
yet
so
there
were
quarrels
and
this  am
sure
was
one
of
them
and
your
father
asked
holmes
was
he
in
favour
of
such  union
no
he
was
averse
to
it
also
no
one
but
mr
mccarthy
was
in
favour
of
it  quick
blush
passed
over
her
fresh
young
face
as
holmes
shot
one
of
his
keen
questioning
glances
at
her
thank
you
for
this
information
said
he
may  see
your
father

to
morrow  am
afraid

doctor

doctor

strong

dr
willows

his
nervous
system

shattered

bye
and
god
help
you
in
your
undertaking
she
hurried
from
the
room
as
impulsively
as
she
had
entered
and
we
heard
the
wheels
of
her
carriage
rattle
off
down
the
street  am
ashamed
of
you
holmes
said
lestrade
with
dignity
after  few
minutes
silence
why
should
you
raise
up
hopes
which
you
are
bound
to
disappoint  am
not
over
tender
of
heart
but  call
it
cruel  think
that  see
my
way
to
clearing
james
mccarthy
said
holmes
have
you
an
order
to
see
him
in
prison
yes
but
only
for
you
and
me
then  shall
reconsider
my
resolution
about
going
out
we
have
still
time
to
take  train
to
hereford
and
see
him
to
night
ample
then
let
us
do
so
watson  fear
that
you
will
find
it
very
slow
but  shall
only
be
away  couple
of
hours  walked
down
to
the
station
with
them
and
then
wandered
through
the
streets
of
the
little
town
finally
returning
to
the
hotel
where  lay
upon
the
sofa
and
tried
to
interest
myself
in  yellow
backed
novel
the
puny
plot
of
the
story
was
so
thin
however
when
compared
to
the
deep
mystery
through
which
we
were
groping
and  found
my
attention
wander
so
continually
from
the
action
to
the
fact
that  at
last
flung
it
across
the
room
and
gave
myself
up
entirely
to  consideration
of
the
events
of
the
day
supposing
that
this
unhappy
young
man  story
were
absolutely
true
then
what
hellish
thing
what
absolutely
unforeseen
and
extraordinary
calamity
could
have
occurred
between
the
time
when
he
parted
from
his
father
and
the
moment
when
drawn
back
by
his
screams
he
rushed
into
the
glade
it
was
something
terrible
and
deadly
what
could
it
be
might
not
the
nature
of
the
injuries
reveal
something
to
my
medical
instincts  rang
the
bell
and
called
for
the
weekly
county
paper
which
contained  verbatim
account
of
the
inquest
in
the
surgeon  deposition
it
was
stated
that
the
posterior
third
of
the
left
parietal
bone
and
the
left
half
of
the
occipital
bone
had
been
shattered
by  heavy
blow
from  blunt
weapon  marked
the
spot
upon
my
own
head
clearly
such  blow
must
have
been
struck
from
behind
that
was
to
some
extent
in
favour
of
the
accused
as
when
seen
quarrelling
he
was
face
to
face
with
his
father
still
it
did
not
go
for
very
much
for
the
older
man
might
have
turned
his
back
before
the
blow
fell
still
it
might
be
worth
while
to
call
holmes
attention
to
it
then
there
was
the
peculiar
dying
reference
to  rat
what
could
that
mean
it
could
not
be
delirium  man
dying
from  sudden
blow
does
not
commonly
become
delirious
no
it
was
more
likely
to
be
an
attempt
to
explain
how
he
met
his
fate
but
what
could
it
indicate  cudgelled
my
brains
to
find
some
possible
explanation
and
then
the
incident
of
the
grey
cloth
seen
by
young
mccarthy
if
that
were
true
the
murderer
must
have
dropped
some
part
of
his
dress
presumably
his
overcoat
in
his
flight
and
must
have
had
the
hardihood
to
return
and
to
carry
it
away
at
the
instant
when
the
son
was
kneeling
with
his
back
turned
not  dozen
paces
off
what  tissue
of
mysteries
and
improbabilities
the
whole
thing
was  did
not
wonder
at
lestrade  opinion
and
yet  had
so
much
faith
in
sherlock
holmes
insight
that  could
not
lose
hope
as
long
as
every
fresh
fact
seemed
to
strengthen
his
conviction
of
young
mccarthy  innocence
it
was
late
before
sherlock
holmes
returned
he
came
back
alone
for
lestrade
was
staying
in
lodgings
in
the
town
the
glass
still
keeps
very
high
he
remarked
as
he
sat
down
it
is
of
importance
that
it
should
not
rain
before
we
are
able
to
go
over
the
ground
on
the
other
hand  man
should
be
at
his
very
best
and
keenest
for
such
nice
work
as
that
and  did
not
wish
to
do
it
when
fagged
by  long
journey  have
seen
young
mccarthy
and
what
did
you
learn
from
him
nothing
could
he
throw
no
light
none
at
all  was
inclined
to
think
at
one
time
that
he
knew
who
had
done
it
and
was
screening
him
or
her
but  am
convinced
now
that
he
is
as
puzzled
as
everyone
else
he
is
not  very
quick
witted
youth
though
comely
to
look
at
and  should
think
sound
at
heart  cannot
admire
his
taste  remarked
if
it
is
indeed  fact
that
he
was
averse
to  marriage
with
so
charming  young
lady
as
this
miss
turner
ah
thereby
hangs  rather
painful
tale
this
fellow
is
madly
insanely
in
love
with
her
but
some
two
years
ago
when
he
was
only  lad
and
before
he
really
knew
her
for
she
had
been
away
five
years
at  boarding
school
what
does
the
idiot
do
but
get
into
the
clutches
of  barmaid
in
bristol
and
marry
her
at  registry
office
no
one
knows  word
of
the
matter
but
you
can
imagine
how
maddening
it
must
be
to
him
to
be
upbraided
for
not
doing
what
he
would
give
his
very
eyes
to
do
but
what
he
knows
to
be
absolutely
impossible
it
was
sheer
frenzy
of
this
sort
which
made
him
throw
his
hands
up
into
the
air
when
his
father
at
their
last
interview
was
goading
him
on
to
propose
to
miss
turner
on
the
other
hand
he
had
no
means
of
supporting
himself
and
his
father
who
was
by
all
accounts  very
hard
man
would
have
thrown
him
over
utterly
had
he
known
the
truth
it
was
with
his
barmaid
wife
that
he
had
spent
the
last
three
days
in
bristol
and
his
father
did
not
know
where
he
was
mark
that
point
it
is
of
importance
good
has
come
out
of
evil
however
for
the
barmaid
finding
from
the
papers
that
he
is
in
serious
trouble
and
likely
to
be
hanged
has
thrown
him
over
utterly
and
has
written
to
him
to
say
that
she
has  husband
already
in
the
bermuda
dockyard
so
that
there
is
really
no
tie
between
them  think
that
that
bit
of
news
has
consoled
young
mccarthy
for
all
that
he
has
suffered
but
if
he
is
innocent
who
has
done
it
ah
who  would
call
your
attention
very
particularly
to
two
points
one
is
that
the
murdered
man
had
an
appointment
with
someone
at
the
pool
and
that
the
someone
could
not
have
been
his
son
for
his
son
was
away
and
he
did
not
know
when
he
would
return
the
second
is
that
the
murdered
man
was
heard
to
cry
cooee
before
he
knew
that
his
son
had
returned
those
are
the
crucial
points
upon
which
the
case
depends
and
now
let
us
talk
about
george
meredith
if
you
please
and
we
shall
leave
all
minor
matters
until
to
morrow
there
was
no
rain
as
holmes
had
foretold
and
the
morning
broke
bright
and
cloudless
at
nine  clock
lestrade
called
for
us
with
the
carriage
and
we
set
off
for
hatherley
farm
and
the
boscombe
pool
there
is
serious
news
this
morning
lestrade
observed
it
is
said
that
mr
turner
of
the
hall
is
so
ill
that
his
life
is
despaired
of
an
elderly
man  presume
said
holmes
about
sixty
but
his
constitution
has
been
shattered
by
his
life
abroad
and
he
has
been
in
failing
health
for
some
time
this
business
has
had  very
bad
effect
upon
him
he
was
an
old
friend
of
mccarthy  and  may
add  great
benefactor
to
him
for  have
learned
that
he
gave
him
hatherley
farm
rent
free
indeed
that
is
interesting
said
holmes
oh
yes
in  hundred
other
ways
he
has
helped
him
everybody
about
here
speaks
of
his
kindness
to
him
really
does
it
not
strike
you
as  little
singular
that
this
mccarthy
who
appears
to
have
had
little
of
his
own
and
to
have
been
under
such
obligations
to
turner
should
still
talk
of
marrying
his
son
to
turner  daughter
who
is
presumably
heiress
to
the
estate
and
that
in
such  very
cocksure
manner
as
if
it
were
merely  case
of  proposal
and
all
else
would
follow
it
is
the
more
strange
since
we
know
that
turner
himself
was
averse
to
the
idea
the
daughter
told
us
as
much
do
you
not
deduce
something
from
that
we
have
got
to
the
deductions
and
the
inferences
said
lestrade
winking
at
me  find
it
hard
enough
to
tackle
facts
holmes
without
flying
away
after
theories
and
fancies
you
are
right
said
holmes
demurely
you
do
find
it
very
hard
to
tackle
the
facts
anyhow  have
grasped
one
fact
which
you
seem
to
find
it
difficult
to
get
hold
of
replied
lestrade
with
some
warmth
and
that
is
that
mccarthy
senior
met
his
death
from
mccarthy
junior
and
that
all
theories
to
the
contrary
are
the
merest
moonshine
well
moonshine
is  brighter
thing
than
fog
said
holmes
laughing
but  am
very
much
mistaken
if
this
is
not
hatherley
farm
upon
the
left
yes
that
is
it
it
was  widespread
comfortable
looking
building
two
storied
slate
roofed
with
great
yellow
blotches
of
lichen
upon
the
grey
walls
the
drawn
blinds
and
the
smokeless
chimneys
however
gave
it  stricken
look
as
though
the
weight
of
this
horror
still
lay
heavy
upon
it
we
called
at
the
door
when
the
maid
at
holmes
request
showed
us
the
boots
which
her
master
wore
at
the
time
of
his
death
and
also  pair
of
the
son  though
not
the
pair
which
he
had
then
had
having
measured
these
very
carefully
from
seven
or
eight
different
points
holmes
desired
to
be
led
to
the
court
yard
from
which
we
all
followed
the
winding
track
which
led
to
boscombe
pool
sherlock
holmes
was
transformed
when
he
was
hot
upon
such  scent
as
this
men
who
had
only
known
the
quiet
thinker
and
logician
of
baker
street
would
have
failed
to
recognise
him
his
face
flushed
and
darkened
his
brows
were
drawn
into
two
hard
black
lines
while
his
eyes
shone
out
from
beneath
them
with  steely
glitter
his
face
was
bent
downward
his
shoulders
bowed
his
lips
compressed
and
the
veins
stood
out
like
whipcord
in
his
long
sinewy
neck
his
nostrils
seemed
to
dilate
with  purely
animal
lust
for
the
chase
and
his
mind
was
so
absolutely
concentrated
upon
the
matter
before
him
that  question
or
remark
fell
unheeded
upon
his
ears
or
at
the
most
only
provoked  quick
impatient
snarl
in
reply
swiftly
and
silently
he
made
his
way
along
the
track
which
ran
through
the
meadows
and
so
by
way
of
the
woods
to
the
boscombe
pool
it
was
damp
marshy
ground
as
is
all
that
district
and
there
were
marks
of
many
feet
both
upon
the
path
and
amid
the
short
grass
which
bounded
it
on
either
side
sometimes
holmes
would
hurry
on
sometimes
stop
dead
and
once
he
made
quite  little
detour
into
the
meadow
lestrade
and  walked
behind
him
the
detective
indifferent
and
contemptuous
while  watched
my
friend
with
the
interest
which
sprang
from
the
conviction
that
every
one
of
his
actions
was
directed
towards  definite
end
the
boscombe
pool
which
is  little
reed
girt
sheet
of
water
some
fifty
yards
across
is
situated
at
the
boundary
between
the
hatherley
farm
and
the
private
park
of
the
wealthy
mr
turner
above
the
woods
which
lined
it
upon
the
farther
side
we
could
see
the
red
jutting
pinnacles
which
marked
the
site
of
the
rich
landowner  dwelling
on
the
hatherley
side
of
the
pool
the
woods
grew
very
thick
and
there
was  narrow
belt
of
sodden
grass
twenty
paces
across
between
the
edge
of
the
trees
and
the
reeds
which
lined
the
lake
lestrade
showed
us
the
exact
spot
at
which
the
body
had
been
found
and
indeed
so
moist
was
the
ground
that  could
plainly
see
the
traces
which
had
been
left
by
the
fall
of
the
stricken
man
to
holmes
as  could
see
by
his
eager
face
and
peering
eyes
very
many
other
things
were
to
be
read
upon
the
trampled
grass
he
ran
round
like  dog
who
is
picking
up  scent
and
then
turned
upon
my
companion
what
did
you
go
into
the
pool
for
he
asked  fished
about
with  rake  thought
there
might
be
some
weapon
or
other
trace
but
how
on
earth
oh
tut
tut  have
no
time
that
left
foot
of
yours
with
its
inward
twist
is
all
over
the
place  mole
could
trace
it
and
there
it
vanishes
among
the
reeds
oh
how
simple
it
would
all
have
been
had  been
here
before
they
came
like  herd
of
buffalo
and
wallowed
all
over
it
here
is
where
the
party
with
the
lodge
keeper
came
and
they
have
covered
all
tracks
for
six
or
eight
feet
round
the
body
but
here
are
three
separate
tracks
of
the
same
feet
he
drew
out  lens
and
lay
down
upon
his
waterproof
to
have  better
view
talking
all
the
time
rather
to
himself
than
to
us
these
are
young
mccarthy  feet
twice
he
was
walking
and
once
he
ran
swiftly
so
that
the
soles
are
deeply
marked
and
the
heels
hardly
visible
that
bears
out
his
story
he
ran
when
he
saw
his
father
on
the
ground
then
here
are
the
father  feet
as
he
paced
up
and
down
what
is
this
then
it
is
the
butt
end
of
the
gun
as
the
son
stood
listening
and
this
ha
ha
what
have
we
here
tiptoes
tiptoes
square
too
quite
unusual
boots
they
come
they
go
they
come
again
of
course
that
was
for
the
cloak
now
where
did
they
come
from
he
ran
up
and
down
sometimes
losing
sometimes
finding
the
track
until
we
were
well
within
the
edge
of
the
wood
and
under
the
shadow
of  great
beech
the
largest
tree
in
the
neighbourhood
holmes
traced
his
way
to
the
farther
side
of
this
and
lay
down
once
more
upon
his
face
with  little
cry
of
satisfaction
for  long
time
he
remained
there
turning
over
the
leaves
and
dried
sticks
gathering
up
what
seemed
to
me
to
be
dust
into
an
envelope
and
examining
with
his
lens
not
only
the
ground
but
even
the
bark
of
the
tree
as
far
as
he
could
reach  jagged
stone
was
lying
among
the
moss
and
this
also
he
carefully
examined
and
retained
then
he
followed  pathway
through
the
wood
until
he
came
to
the
highroad
where
all
traces
were
lost
it
has
been  case
of
considerable
interest
he
remarked
returning
to
his
natural
manner  fancy
that
this
grey
house
on
the
right
must
be
the
lodge  think
that  will
go
in
and
have  word
with
moran
and
perhaps
write  little
note
having
done
that
we
may
drive
back
to
our
luncheon
you
may
walk
to
the
cab
and  shall
be
with
you
presently
it
was
about
ten
minutes
before
we
regained
our
cab
and
drove
back
into
ross
holmes
still
carrying
with
him
the
stone
which
he
had
picked
up
in
the
wood
this
may
interest
you
lestrade
he
remarked
holding
it
out
the
murder
was
done
with
it  see
no
marks
there
are
none
how
do
you
know
then
the
grass
was
growing
under
it
it
had
only
lain
there  few
days
there
was
no
sign
of  place
whence
it
had
been
taken
it
corresponds
with
the
injuries
there
is
no
sign
of
any
other
weapon
and
the
murderer
is  tall
man
left
handed
limps
with
the
right
leg
wears
thick
soled
shooting
boots
and  grey
cloak
smokes
indian
cigars
uses  cigar
holder
and
carries  blunt
pen
knife
in
his
pocket
there
are
several
other
indications
but
these
may
be
enough
to
aid
us
in
our
search
lestrade
laughed  am
afraid
that  am
still  sceptic
he
said
theories
are
all
very
well
but
we
have
to
deal
with  hard
headed
british
jury
nous
verrons
answered
holmes
calmly
you
work
your
own
method
and  shall
work
mine  shall
be
busy
this
afternoon
and
shall
probably
return
to
london
by
the
evening
train
and
leave
your
case
unfinished
no
finished
but
the
mystery
it
is
solved
who
was
the
criminal
then
the
gentleman  describe
but
who
is
he
surely
it
would
not
be
difficult
to
find
out
this
is
not
such  populous
neighbourhood
lestrade
shrugged
his
shoulders  am  practical
man
he
said
and  really
cannot
undertake
to
go
about
the
country
looking
for  left
handed
gentleman
with  game
leg  should
become
the
laughing
stock
of
scotland
yard
all
right
said
holmes
quietly  have
given
you
the
chance
here
are
your
lodgings
good
bye  shall
drop
you  line
before  leave
having
left
lestrade
at
his
rooms
we
drove
to
our
hotel
where
we
found
lunch
upon
the
table
holmes
was
silent
and
buried
in
thought
with  pained
expression
upon
his
face
as
one
who
finds
himself
in  perplexing
position
look
here
watson
he
said
when
the
cloth
was
cleared
just
sit
down
in
this
chair
and
let
me
preach
to
you
for  little  don  know
quite
what
to
do
and  should
value
your
advice
light  cigar
and
let
me
expound
pray
do
so
well
now
in
considering
this
case
there
are
two
points
about
young
mccarthy  narrative
which
struck
us
both
instantly
although
they
impressed
me
in
his
favour
and
you
against
him
one
was
the
fact
that
his
father
should
according
to
his
account
cry
cooee
before
seeing
him
the
other
was
his
singular
dying
reference
to  rat
he
mumbled
several
words
you
understand
but
that
was
all
that
caught
the
son  ear
now
from
this
double
point
our
research
must
commence
and
we
will
begin
it
by
presuming
that
what
the
lad
says
is
absolutely
true
what
of
this
cooee
then
well
obviously
it
could
not
have
been
meant
for
the
son
the
son
as
far
as
he
knew
was
in
bristol
it
was
mere
chance
that
he
was
within
earshot
the
cooee
was
meant
to
attract
the
attention
of
whoever
it
was
that
he
had
the
appointment
with
but
cooee
is  distinctly
australian
cry
and
one
which
is
used
between
australians
there
is  strong
presumption
that
the
person
whom
mccarthy
expected
to
meet
him
at
boscombe
pool
was
someone
who
had
been
in
australia
what
of
the
rat
then
sherlock
holmes
took  folded
paper
from
his
pocket
and
flattened
it
out
on
the
table
this
is  map
of
the
colony
of
victoria
he
said  wired
to
bristol
for
it
last
night
he
put
his
hand
over
part
of
the
map
what
do
you
read
arat  read
and
now
he
raised
his
hand
ballarat
quite
so
that
was
the
word
the
man
uttered
and
of
which
his
son
only
caught
the
last
two
syllables
he
was
trying
to
utter
the
name
of
his
murderer
so
and
so
of
ballarat
it
is
wonderful  exclaimed
it
is
obvious
and
now
you
see  had
narrowed
the
field
down
considerably
the
possession
of  grey
garment
was  third
point
which
granting
the
son  statement
to
be
correct
was  certainty
we
have
come
now
out
of
mere
vagueness
to
the
definite
conception
of
an
australian
from
ballarat
with  grey
cloak
certainly
and
one
who
was
at
home
in
the
district
for
the
pool
can
only
be
approached
by
the
farm
or
by
the
estate
where
strangers
could
hardly
wander
quite
so
then
comes
our
expedition
of
to
day
by
an
examination
of
the
ground  gained
the
trifling
details
which  gave
to
that
imbecile
lestrade
as
to
the
personality
of
the
criminal
but
how
did
you
gain
them
you
know
my
method
it
is
founded
upon
the
observation
of
trifles
his
height  know
that
you
might
roughly
judge
from
the
length
of
his
stride
his
boots
too
might
be
told
from
their
traces
yes
they
were
peculiar
boots
but
his
lameness
the
impression
of
his
right
foot
was
always
less
distinct
than
his
left
he
put
less
weight
upon
it
why
because
he
limped
he
was
lame
but
his
left
handedness
you
were
yourself
struck
by
the
nature
of
the
injury
as
recorded
by
the
surgeon
at
the
inquest
the
blow
was
struck
from
immediately
behind
and
yet
was
upon
the
left
side
now
how
can
that
be
unless
it
were
by  left
handed
man
he
had
stood
behind
that
tree
during
the
interview
between
the
father
and
son
he
had
even
smoked
there  found
the
ash
of  cigar
which
my
special
knowledge
of
tobacco
ashes
enables
me
to
pronounce
as
an
indian
cigar  have
as
you
know
devoted
some
attention
to
this
and
written  little
monograph
on
the
ashes
of
different
varieties
of
pipe
cigar
and
cigarette
tobacco
having
found
the
ash  then
looked
round
and
discovered
the
stump
among
the
moss
where
he
had
tossed
it
it
was
an
indian
cigar
of
the
variety
which
are
rolled
in
rotterdam
and
the
cigar
holder  could
see
that
the
end
had
not
been
in
his
mouth
therefore
he
used  holder
the
tip
had
been
cut
off
not
bitten
off
but
the
cut
was
not  clean
one
so  deduced  blunt
pen
knife
holmes  said
you
have
drawn  net
round
this
man
from
which
he
cannot
escape
and
you
have
saved
an
innocent
human
life
as
truly
as
if
you
had
cut
the
cord
which
was
hanging
him  see
the
direction
in
which
all
this
points
the
culprit
is
mr
john
turner
cried
the
hotel
waiter
opening
the
door
of
our
sitting
room
and
ushering
in  visitor
the
man
who
entered
was  strange
and
impressive
figure
his
slow
limping
step
and
bowed
shoulders
gave
the
appearance
of
decrepitude
and
yet
his
hard
deep
lined
craggy
features
and
his
enormous
limbs
showed
that
he
was
possessed
of
unusual
strength
of
body
and
of
character
his
tangled
beard
grizzled
hair
and
outstanding
drooping
eyebrows
combined
to
give
an
air
of
dignity
and
power
to
his
appearance
but
his
face
was
of
an
ashen
white
while
his
lips
and
the
corners
of
his
nostrils
were
tinged
with  shade
of
blue
it
was
clear
to
me
at  glance
that
he
was
in
the
grip
of
some
deadly
and
chronic
disease
pray
sit
down
on
the
sofa
said
holmes
gently
you
had
my
note
yes
the
lodge
keeper
brought
it
up
you
said
that
you
wished
to
see
me
here
to
avoid
scandal  thought
people
would
talk
if  went
to
the
hall
and
why
did
you
wish
to
see
me
he
looked
across
at
my
companion
with
despair
in
his
weary
eyes
as
though
his
question
was
already
answered
yes
said
holmes
answering
the
look
rather
than
the
words
it
is
so  know
all
about
mccarthy
the
old
man
sank
his
face
in
his
hands
god
help
me
he
cried
but  would
not
have
let
the
young
man
come
to
harm  give
you
my
word
that  would
have
spoken
out
if
it
went
against
him
at
the
assizes  am
glad
to
hear
you
say
so
said
holmes
gravely  would
have
spoken
now
had
it
not
been
for
my
dear
girl
it
would
break
her
heart
it
will
break
her
heart
when
she
hears
that  am
arrested
it
may
not
come
to
that
said
holmes
what  am
no
official
agent  understand
that
it
was
your
daughter
who
required
my
presence
here
and  am
acting
in
her
interests
young
mccarthy
must
be
got
off
however  am  dying
man
said
old
turner  have
had
diabetes
for
years
my
doctor
says
it
is  question
whether  shall
live  month
yet  would
rather
die
under
my
own
roof
than
in  gaol
holmes
rose
and
sat
down
at
the
table
with
his
pen
in
his
hand
and  bundle
of
paper
before
him
just
tell
us
the
truth
he
said  shall
jot
down
the
facts
you
will
sign
it
and
watson
here
can
witness
it
then  could
produce
your
confession
at
the
last
extremity
to
save
young
mccarthy  promise
you
that  shall
not
use
it
unless
it
is
absolutely
needed
it  as
well
said
the
old
man
it  a
question
whether  shall
live
to
the
assizes
so
it
matters
little
to
me
but  should
wish
to
spare
alice
the
shock
and
now  will
make
the
thing
clear
to
you
it
has
been  long
time
in
the
acting
but
will
not
take
me
long
to
tell
you
didn  know
this
dead
man
mccarthy
he
was  devil
incarnate  tell
you
that
god
keep
you
out
of
the
clutches
of
such  man
as
he
his
grip
has
been
upon
me
these
twenty
years
and
he
has
blasted
my
life  ll
tell
you
first
how  came
to
be
in
his
power
it
was
in
the
early  at
the
diggings  was  young
chap
then
hot
blooded
and
reckless
ready
to
turn
my
hand
at
anything  got
among
bad
companions
took
to
drink
had
no
luck
with
my
claim
took
to
the
bush
and
in  word
became
what
you
would
call
over
here  highway
robber
there
were
six
of
us
and
we
had  wild
free
life
of
it
sticking
up  station
from
time
to
time
or
stopping
the
wagons
on
the
road
to
the
diggings
black
jack
of
ballarat
was
the
name  went
under
and
our
party
is
still
remembered
in
the
colony
as
the
ballarat
gang
one
day  gold
convoy
came
down
from
ballarat
to
melbourne
and
we
lay
in
wait
for
it
and
attacked
it
there
were
six
troopers
and
six
of
us
so
it
was  close
thing
but
we
emptied
four
of
their
saddles
at
the
first
volley
three
of
our
boys
were
killed
however
before
we
got
the
swag  put
my
pistol
to
the
head
of
the
wagon
driver
who
was
this
very
man
mccarthy  wish
to
the
lord
that  had
shot
him
then
but  spared
him
though  saw
his
wicked
little
eyes
fixed
on
my
face
as
though
to
remember
every
feature
we
got
away
with
the
gold
became
wealthy
men
and
made
our
way
over
to
england
without
being
suspected
there  parted
from
my
old
pals
and
determined
to
settle
down
to  quiet
and
respectable
life  bought
this
estate
which
chanced
to
be
in
the
market
and  set
myself
to
do  little
good
with
my
money
to
make
up
for
the
way
in
which  had
earned
it  married
too
and
though
my
wife
died
young
she
left
me
my
dear
little
alice
even
when
she
was
just  baby
her
wee
hand
seemed
to
lead
me
down
the
right
path
as
nothing
else
had
ever
done
in  word  turned
over  new
leaf
and
did
my
best
to
make
up
for
the
past
all
was
going
well
when
mccarthy
laid
his
grip
upon
me  had
gone
up
to
town
about
an
investment
and  met
him
in
regent
street
with
hardly  coat
to
his
back
or  boot
to
his
foot
here
we
are
jack
says
he
touching
me
on
the
arm
we
ll
be
as
good
as  family
to
you
there  two
of
us
me
and
my
son
and
you
can
have
the
keeping
of
us
if
you
don  it  a
fine
law
abiding
country
is
england
and
there  always  policeman
within
hail
well
down
they
came
to
the
west
country
there
was
no
shaking
them
off
and
there
they
have
lived
rent
free
on
my
best
land
ever
since
there
was
no
rest
for
me
no
peace
no
forgetfulness
turn
where  would
there
was
his
cunning
grinning
face
at
my
elbow
it
grew
worse
as
alice
grew
up
for
he
soon
saw  was
more
afraid
of
her
knowing
my
past
than
of
the
police
whatever
he
wanted
he
must
have
and
whatever
it
was  gave
him
without
question
land
money
houses
until
at
last
he
asked  thing
which  could
not
give
he
asked
for
alice
his
son
you
see
had
grown
up
and
so
had
my
girl
and
as  was
known
to
be
in
weak
health
it
seemed  fine
stroke
to
him
that
his
lad
should
step
into
the
whole
property
but
there  was
firm  would
not
have
his
cursed
stock
mixed
with
mine
not
that  had
any
dislike
to
the
lad
but
his
blood
was
in
him
and
that
was
enough  stood
firm
mccarthy
threatened  braved
him
to
do
his
worst
we
were
to
meet
at
the
pool
midway
between
our
houses
to
talk
it
over
when  went
down
there  found
him
talking
with
his
son
so  smoked  cigar
and
waited
behind  tree
until
he
should
be
alone
but
as  listened
to
his
talk
all
that
was
black
and
bitter
in
me
seemed
to
come
uppermost
he
was
urging
his
son
to
marry
my
daughter
with
as
little
regard
for
what
she
might
think
as
if
she
were  slut
from
off
the
streets
it
drove
me
mad
to
think
that  and
all
that  held
most
dear
should
be
in
the
power
of
such  man
as
this
could  not
snap
the
bond  was
already  dying
and  desperate
man
though
clear
of
mind
and
fairly
strong
of
limb  knew
that
my
own
fate
was
sealed
but
my
memory
and
my
girl
both
could
be
saved
if  could
but
silence
that
foul
tongue  did
it
mr
holmes  would
do
it
again
deeply
as  have
sinned  have
led  life
of
martyrdom
to
atone
for
it
but
that
my
girl
should
be
entangled
in
the
same
meshes
which
held
me
was
more
than  could
suffer  struck
him
down
with
no
more
compunction
than
if
he
had
been
some
foul
and
venomous
beast
his
cry
brought
back
his
son
but  had
gained
the
cover
of
the
wood
though  was
forced
to
go
back
to
fetch
the
cloak
which  had
dropped
in
my
flight
that
is
the
true
story
gentlemen
of
all
that
occurred
well
it
is
not
for
me
to
judge
you
said
holmes
as
the
old
man
signed
the
statement
which
had
been
drawn
out  pray
that
we
may
never
be
exposed
to
such  temptation  pray
not
sir
and
what
do
you
intend
to
do
in
view
of
your
health
nothing
you
are
yourself
aware
that
you
will
soon
have
to
answer
for
your
deed
at  higher
court
than
the
assizes  will
keep
your
confession
and
if
mccarthy
is
condemned  shall
be
forced
to
use
it
if
not
it
shall
never
be
seen
by
mortal
eye
and
your
secret
whether
you
be
alive
or
dead
shall
be
safe
with
us
farewell
then
said
the
old
man
solemnly
your
own
deathbeds
when
they
come
will
be
the
easier
for
the
thought
of
the
peace
which
you
have
given
to
mine
tottering
and
shaking
in
all
his
giant
frame
he
stumbled
slowly
from
the
room
god
help
us
said
holmes
after  long
silence
why
does
fate
play
such
tricks
with
poor
helpless
worms  never
hear
of
such  case
as
this
that  do
not
think
of
baxter  words
and
say
there
but
for
the
grace
of
god
goes
sherlock
holmes
james
mccarthy
was
acquitted
at
the
assizes
on
the
strength
of  number
of
objections
which
had
been
drawn
out
by
holmes
and
submitted
to
the
defending
counsel
old
turner
lived
for
seven
months
after
our
interview
but
he
is
now
dead
and
there
is
every
prospect
that
the
son
and
daughter
may
come
to
live
happily
together
in
ignorance
of
the
black
cloud
which
rests
upon
their
past
adventure  the
five
orange
pips
when  glance
over
my
notes
and
records
of
the
sherlock
holmes
cases
between
the
years
and  am
faced
by
so
many
which
present
strange
and
interesting
features
that
it
is
no
easy
matter
to
know
which
to
choose
and
which
to
leave
some
however
have
already
gained
publicity
through
the
papers
and
others
have
not
offered  field
for
those
peculiar
qualities
which
my
friend
possessed
in
so
high  degree
and
which
it
is
the
object
of
these
papers
to
illustrate
some
too
have
baffled
his
analytical
skill
and
would
be
as
narratives
beginnings
without
an
ending
while
others
have
been
but
partially
cleared
up
and
have
their
explanations
founded
rather
upon
conjecture
and
surmise
than
on
that
absolute
logical
proof
which
was
so
dear
to
him
there
is
however
one
of
these
last
which
was
so
remarkable
in
its
details
and
so
startling
in
its
results
that  am
tempted
to
give
some
account
of
it
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
there
are
points
in
connection
with
it
which
never
have
been
and
probably
never
will
be
entirely
cleared
up
the
year
furnished
us
with  long
series
of
cases
of
greater
or
less
interest
of
which  retain
the
records
among
my
headings
under
this
one
twelve
months  find
an
account
of
the
adventure
of
the
paradol
chamber
of
the
amateur
mendicant
society
who
held  luxurious
club
in
the
lower
vault
of  furniture
warehouse
of
the
facts
connected
with
the
loss
of
the
british
barque
sophy
anderson
of
the
singular
adventures
of
the
grice
patersons
in
the
island
of
uffa
and
finally
of
the
camberwell
poisoning
case
in
the
latter
as
may
be
remembered
sherlock
holmes
was
able
by
winding
up
the
dead
man  watch
to
prove
that
it
had
been
wound
up
two
hours
before
and
that
therefore
the
deceased
had
gone
to
bed
within
that
time  deduction
which
was
of
the
greatest
importance
in
clearing
up
the
case
all
these  may
sketch
out
at
some
future
date
but
none
of
them
present
such
singular
features
as
the
strange
train
of
circumstances
which  have
now
taken
up
my
pen
to
describe
it
was
in
the
latter
days
of
september
and
the
equinoctial
gales
had
set
in
with
exceptional
violence
all
day
the
wind
had
screamed
and
the
rain
had
beaten
against
the
windows
so
that
even
here
in
the
heart
of
great
hand
made
london
we
were
forced
to
raise
our
minds
for
the
instant
from
the
routine
of
life
and
to
recognise
the
presence
of
those
great
elemental
forces
which
shriek
at
mankind
through
the
bars
of
his
civilisation
like
untamed
beasts
in  cage
as
evening
drew
in
the
storm
grew
higher
and
louder
and
the
wind
cried
and
sobbed
like  child
in
the
chimney
sherlock
holmes
sat
moodily
at
one
side
of
the
fireplace
cross
indexing
his
records
of
crime
while  at
the
other
was
deep
in
one
of
clark
russell  fine
sea
stories
until
the
howl
of
the
gale
from
without
seemed
to
blend
with
the
text
and
the
splash
of
the
rain
to
lengthen
out
into
the
long
swash
of
the
sea
waves
my
wife
was
on  visit
to
her
mother  and
for  few
days  was  dweller
once
more
in
my
old
quarters
at
baker
street
why
said  glancing
up
at
my
companion
that
was
surely
the
bell
who
could
come
to
night
some
friend
of
yours
perhaps
except
yourself  have
none
he
answered  do
not
encourage
visitors  client
then
if
so
it
is  serious
case
nothing
less
would
bring  man
out
on
such  day
and
at
such
an
hour
but  take
it
that
it
is
more
likely
to
be
some
crony
of
the
landlady  sherlock
holmes
was
wrong
in
his
conjecture
however
for
there
came  step
in
the
passage
and  tapping
at
the
door
he
stretched
out
his
long
arm
to
turn
the
lamp
away
from
himself
and
towards
the
vacant
chair
upon
which  newcomer
must
sit
come
in
said
he
the
man
who
entered
was
young
some
two
and
twenty
at
the
outside
well
groomed
and
trimly
clad
with
something
of
refinement
and
delicacy
in
his
bearing
the
streaming
umbrella
which
he
held
in
his
hand
and
his
long
shining
waterproof
told
of
the
fierce
weather
through
which
he
had
come
he
looked
about
him
anxiously
in
the
glare
of
the
lamp
and  could
see
that
his
face
was
pale
and
his
eyes
heavy
like
those
of  man
who
is
weighed
down
with
some
great
anxiety  owe
you
an
apology
he
said
raising
his
golden
pince
nez
to
his
eyes  trust
that  am
not
intruding  fear
that  have
brought
some
traces
of
the
storm
and
rain
into
your
snug
chamber
give
me
your
coat
and
umbrella
said
holmes
they
may
rest
here
on
the
hook
and
will
be
dry
presently
you
have
come
up
from
the
south
west  see
yes
from
horsham
that
clay
and
chalk
mixture
which  see
upon
your
toe
caps
is
quite
distinctive  have
come
for
advice
that
is
easily
got
and
help
that
is
not
always
so
easy  have
heard
of
you
mr
holmes  heard
from
major
prendergast
how
you
saved
him
in
the
tankerville
club
scandal
ah
of
course
he
was
wrongfully
accused
of
cheating
at
cards
he
said
that
you
could
solve
anything
he
said
too
much
that
you
are
never
beaten  have
been
beaten
four
times
three
times
by
men
and
once
by  woman
but
what
is
that
compared
with
the
number
of
your
successes
it
is
true
that  have
been
generally
successful
then
you
may
be
so
with
me  beg
that
you
will
draw
your
chair
up
to
the
fire
and
favour
me
with
some
details
as
to
your
case
it
is
no
ordinary
one
none
of
those
which
come
to
me
are  am
the
last
court
of
appeal
and
yet  question
sir
whether
in
all
your
experience
you
have
ever
listened
to  more
mysterious
and
inexplicable
chain
of
events
than
those
which
have
happened
in
my
own
family
you
fill
me
with
interest
said
holmes
pray
give
us
the
essential
facts
from
the
commencement
and  can
afterwards
question
you
as
to
those
details
which
seem
to
me
to
be
most
important
the
young
man
pulled
his
chair
up
and
pushed
his
wet
feet
out
towards
the
blaze
my
name
said
he
is
john
openshaw
but
my
own
affairs
have
as
far
as  can
understand
little
to
do
with
this
awful
business
it
is  hereditary
matter
so
in
order
to
give
you
an
idea
of
the
facts  must
go
back
to
the
commencement
of
the
affair
you
must
know
that
my
grandfather
had
two
sons
my
uncle
elias
and
my
father
joseph
my
father
had  small
factory
at
coventry
which
he
enlarged
at
the
time
of
the
invention
of
bicycling
he
was  patentee
of
the
openshaw
unbreakable
tire
and
his
business
met
with
such
success
that
he
was
able
to
sell
it
and
to
retire
upon  handsome
competence
my
uncle
elias
emigrated
to
america
when
he
was  young
man
and
became  planter
in
florida
where
he
was
reported
to
have
done
very
well
at
the
time
of
the
war
he
fought
in
jackson  army
and
afterwards
under
hood
where
he
rose
to
be  colonel
when
lee
laid
down
his
arms
my
uncle
returned
to
his
plantation
where
he
remained
for
three
or
four
years
about
or
he
came
back
to
europe
and
took  small
estate
in
sussex
near
horsham
he
had
made  very
considerable
fortune
in
the
states
and
his
reason
for
leaving
them
was
his
aversion
to
the
negroes
and
his
dislike
of
the
republican
policy
in
extending
the
franchise
to
them
he
was  singular
man
fierce
and
quick
tempered
very
foul
mouthed
when
he
was
angry
and
of  most
retiring
disposition
during
all
the
years
that
he
lived
at
horsham  doubt
if
ever
he
set
foot
in
the
town
he
had  garden
and
two
or
three
fields
round
his
house
and
there
he
would
take
his
exercise
though
very
often
for
weeks
on
end
he
would
never
leave
his
room
he
drank  great
deal
of
brandy
and
smoked
very
heavily
but
he
would
see
no
society
and
did
not
want
any
friends
not
even
his
own
brother
he
didn  mind
me
in
fact
he
took  fancy
to
me
for
at
the
time
when
he
saw
me
first  was  youngster
of
twelve
or
so
this
would
be
in
the
year
after
he
had
been
eight
or
nine
years
in
england
he
begged
my
father
to
let
me
live
with
him
and
he
was
very
kind
to
me
in
his
way
when
he
was
sober
he
used
to
be
fond
of
playing
backgammon
and
draughts
with
me
and
he
would
make
me
his
representative
both
with
the
servants
and
with
the
tradespeople
so
that
by
the
time
that  was
sixteen  was
quite
master
of
the
house  kept
all
the
keys
and
could
go
where  liked
and
do
what  liked
so
long
as  did
not
disturb
him
in
his
privacy
there
was
one
singular
exception
however
for
he
had  single
room  lumber
room
up
among
the
attics
which
was
invariably
locked
and
which
he
would
never
permit
either
me
or
anyone
else
to
enter
with  boy  curiosity  have
peeped
through
the
keyhole
but  was
never
able
to
see
more
than
such  collection
of
old
trunks
and
bundles
as
would
be
expected
in
such  room
one
day
it
was
in
march  letter
with  foreign
stamp
lay
upon
the
table
in
front
of
the
colonel  plate
it
was
not  common
thing
for
him
to
receive
letters
for
his
bills
were
all
paid
in
ready
money
and
he
had
no
friends
of
any
sort
from
india
said
he
as
he
took
it
up
pondicherry
postmark
what
can
this
be
opening
it
hurriedly
out
there
jumped
five
little
dried
orange
pips
which
pattered
down
upon
his
plate  began
to
laugh
at
this
but
the
laugh
was
struck
from
my
lips
at
the
sight
of
his
face
his
lip
had
fallen
his
eyes
were
protruding
his
skin
the
colour
of
putty
and
he
glared
at
the
envelope
which
he
still
held
in
his
trembling
hand  k  he
shrieked
and
then
my
god
my
god
my
sins
have
overtaken
me
what
is
it
uncle  cried
death
said
he
and
rising
from
the
table
he
retired
to
his
room
leaving
me
palpitating
with
horror  took
up
the
envelope
and
saw
scrawled
in
red
ink
upon
the
inner
flap
just
above
the
gum
the
letter  three
times
repeated
there
was
nothing
else
save
the
five
dried
pips
what
could
be
the
reason
of
his
overpowering
terror  left
the
breakfast
table
and
as  ascended
the
stair  met
him
coming
down
with
an
old
rusty
key
which
must
have
belonged
to
the
attic
in
one
hand
and  small
brass
box
like  cashbox
in
the
other
they
may
do
what
they
like
but  ll
checkmate
them
still
said
he
with
an
oath
tell
mary
that  shall
want  fire
in
my
room
to
day
and
send
down
to
fordham
the
horsham
lawyer  did
as
he
ordered
and
when
the
lawyer
arrived  was
asked
to
step
up
to
the
room
the
fire
was
burning
brightly
and
in
the
grate
there
was  mass
of
black
fluffy
ashes
as
of
burned
paper
while
the
brass
box
stood
open
and
empty
beside
it
as  glanced
at
the
box  noticed
with  start
that
upon
the
lid
was
printed
the
treble  which  had
read
in
the
morning
upon
the
envelope  wish
you
john
said
my
uncle
to
witness
my
will  leave
my
estate
with
all
its
advantages
and
all
its
disadvantages
to
my
brother
your
father
whence
it
will
no
doubt
descend
to
you
if
you
can
enjoy
it
in
peace
well
and
good
if
you
find
you
cannot
take
my
advice
my
boy
and
leave
it
to
your
deadliest
enemy  am
sorry
to
give
you
such  two
edged
thing
but  can  say
what
turn
things
are
going
to
take
kindly
sign
the
paper
where
mr
fordham
shows
you  signed
the
paper
as
directed
and
the
lawyer
took
it
away
with
him
the
singular
incident
made
as
you
may
think
the
deepest
impression
upon
me
and  pondered
over
it
and
turned
it
every
way
in
my
mind
without
being
able
to
make
anything
of
it
yet  could
not
shake
off
the
vague
feeling
of
dread
which
it
left
behind
though
the
sensation
grew
less
keen
as
the
weeks
passed
and
nothing
happened
to
disturb
the
usual
routine
of
our
lives  could
see  change
in
my
uncle
however
he
drank
more
than
ever
and
he
was
less
inclined
for
any
sort
of
society
most
of
his
time
he
would
spend
in
his
room
with
the
door
locked
upon
the
inside
but
sometimes
he
would
emerge
in  sort
of
drunken
frenzy
and
would
burst
out
of
the
house
and
tear
about
the
garden
with  revolver
in
his
hand
screaming
out
that
he
was
afraid
of
no
man
and
that
he
was
not
to
be
cooped
up
like  sheep
in  pen
by
man
or
devil
when
these
hot
fits
were
over
however
he
would
rush
tumultuously
in
at
the
door
and
lock
and
bar
it
behind
him
like  man
who
can
brazen
it
out
no
longer
against
the
terror
which
lies
at
the
roots
of
his
soul
at
such
times  have
seen
his
face
even
on  cold
day
glisten
with
moisture
as
though
it
were
new
raised
from  basin
well
to
come
to
an
end
of
the
matter
mr
holmes
and
not
to
abuse
your
patience
there
came  night
when
he
made
one
of
those
drunken
sallies
from
which
he
never
came
back
we
found
him
when
we
went
to
search
for
him
face
downward
in  little
green
scummed
pool
which
lay
at
the
foot
of
the
garden
there
was
no
sign
of
any
violence
and
the
water
was
but
two
feet
deep
so
that
the
jury
having
regard
to
his
known
eccentricity
brought
in  verdict
of
suicide
but  who
knew
how
he
winced
from
the
very
thought
of
death
had
much
ado
to
persuade
myself
that
he
had
gone
out
of
his
way
to
meet
it
the
matter
passed
however
and
my
father
entered
into
possession
of
the
estate
and
of
some
which
lay
to
his
credit
at
the
bank
one
moment
holmes
interposed
your
statement
is  foresee
one
of
the
most
remarkable
to
which  have
ever
listened
let
me
have
the
date
of
the
reception
by
your
uncle
of
the
letter
and
the
date
of
his
supposed
suicide
the
letter
arrived
on
march
his
death
was
seven
weeks
later
upon
the
night
of
may
nd
thank
you
pray
proceed
when
my
father
took
over
the
horsham
property
he
at
my
request
made  careful
examination
of
the
attic
which
had
been
always
locked
up
we
found
the
brass
box
there
although
its
contents
had
been
destroyed
on
the
inside
of
the
cover
was  paper
label
with
the
initials
of  k  repeated
upon
it
and
letters
memoranda
receipts
and  register
written
beneath
these
we
presume
indicated
the
nature
of
the
papers
which
had
been
destroyed
by
colonel
openshaw
for
the
rest
there
was
nothing
of
much
importance
in
the
attic
save  great
many
scattered
papers
and
note
books
bearing
upon
my
uncle  life
in
america
some
of
them
were
of
the
war
time
and
showed
that
he
had
done
his
duty
well
and
had
borne
the
repute
of  brave
soldier
others
were
of  date
during
the
reconstruction
of
the
southern
states
and
were
mostly
concerned
with
politics
for
he
had
evidently
taken  strong
part
in
opposing
the
carpet
bag
politicians
who
had
been
sent
down
from
the
north
well
it
was
the
beginning
of
when
my
father
came
to
live
at
horsham
and
all
went
as
well
as
possible
with
us
until
the
january
of
on
the
fourth
day
after
the
new
year  heard
my
father
give  sharp
cry
of
surprise
as
we
sat
together
at
the
breakfast
table
there
he
was
sitting
with  newly
opened
envelope
in
one
hand
and
five
dried
orange
pips
in
the
outstretched
palm
of
the
other
one
he
had
always
laughed
at
what
he
called
my
cock
and
bull
story
about
the
colonel
but
he
looked
very
scared
and
puzzled
now
that
the
same
thing
had
come
upon
himself
why
what
on
earth
does
this
mean
john
he
stammered
my
heart
had
turned
to
lead
it
is  k  said  he
looked
inside
the
envelope
so
it
is
he
cried
here
are
the
very
letters
but
what
is
this
written
above
them
put
the
papers
on
the
sundial  read
peeping
over
his
shoulder
what
papers
what
sundial
he
asked
the
sundial
in
the
garden
there
is
no
other
said  but
the
papers
must
be
those
that
are
destroyed
pooh
said
he
gripping
hard
at
his
courage
we
are
in  civilised
land
here
and
we
can  have
tomfoolery
of
this
kind
where
does
the
thing
come
from
from
dundee  answered
glancing
at
the
postmark
some
preposterous
practical
joke
said
he
what
have  to
do
with
sundials
and
papers  shall
take
no
notice
of
such
nonsense  should
certainly
speak
to
the
police  said
and
be
laughed
at
for
my
pains
nothing
of
the
sort
then
let
me
do
so
no  forbid
you  won  have  fuss
made
about
such
nonsense
it
was
in
vain
to
argue
with
him
for
he
was  very
obstinate
man  went
about
however
with  heart
which
was
full
of
forebodings
on
the
third
day
after
the
coming
of
the
letter
my
father
went
from
home
to
visit
an
old
friend
of
his
major
freebody
who
is
in
command
of
one
of
the
forts
upon
portsdown
hill  was
glad
that
he
should
go
for
it
seemed
to
me
that
he
was
farther
from
danger
when
he
was
away
from
home
in
that
however  was
in
error
upon
the
second
day
of
his
absence  received  telegram
from
the
major
imploring
me
to
come
at
once
my
father
had
fallen
over
one
of
the
deep
chalk
pits
which
abound
in
the
neighbourhood
and
was
lying
senseless
with  shattered
skull  hurried
to
him
but
he
passed
away
without
having
ever
recovered
his
consciousness
he
had
as
it
appears
been
returning
from
fareham
in
the
twilight
and
as
the
country
was
unknown
to
him
and
the
chalk
pit
unfenced
the
jury
had
no
hesitation
in
bringing
in  verdict
of
death
from
accidental
causes
carefully
as  examined
every
fact
connected
with
his
death  was
unable
to
find
anything
which
could
suggest
the
idea
of
murder
there
were
no
signs
of
violence
no
footmarks
no
robbery
no
record
of
strangers
having
been
seen
upon
the
roads
and
yet  need
not
tell
you
that
my
mind
was
far
from
at
ease
and
that  was
well
nigh
certain
that
some
foul
plot
had
been
woven
round
him
in
this
sinister
way  came
into
my
inheritance
you
will
ask
me
why  did
not
dispose
of
it  answer
because  was
well
convinced
that
our
troubles
were
in
some
way
dependent
upon
an
incident
in
my
uncle  life
and
that
the
danger
would
be
as
pressing
in
one
house
as
in
another
it
was
in
january
that
my
poor
father
met
his
end
and
two
years
and
eight
months
have
elapsed
since
then
during
that
time  have
lived
happily
at
horsham
and  had
begun
to
hope
that
this
curse
had
passed
away
from
the
family
and
that
it
had
ended
with
the
last
generation  had
begun
to
take
comfort
too
soon
however
yesterday
morning
the
blow
fell
in
the
very
shape
in
which
it
had
come
upon
my
father
the
young
man
took
from
his
waistcoat  crumpled
envelope
and
turning
to
the
table
he
shook
out
upon
it
five
little
dried
orange
pips
this
is
the
envelope
he
continued
the
postmark
is
london
eastern
division
within
are
the
very
words
which
were
upon
my
father  last
message  k  and
then
put
the
papers
on
the
sundial
what
have
you
done
asked
holmes
nothing
nothing
to
tell
the
truth
he
sank
his
face
into
his
thin
white
hands  have
felt
helpless  have
felt
like
one
of
those
poor
rabbits
when
the
snake
is
writhing
towards
it  seem
to
be
in
the
grasp
of
some
resistless
inexorable
evil
which
no
foresight
and
no
precautions
can
guard
against
tut
tut
cried
sherlock
holmes
you
must
act
man
or
you
are
lost
nothing
but
energy
can
save
you
this
is
no
time
for
despair  have
seen
the
police
ah
but
they
listened
to
my
story
with  smile  am
convinced
that
the
inspector
has
formed
the
opinion
that
the
letters
are
all
practical
jokes
and
that
the
deaths
of
my
relations
were
really
accidents
as
the
jury
stated
and
were
not
to
be
connected
with
the
warnings
holmes
shook
his
clenched
hands
in
the
air
incredible
imbecility
he
cried
they
have
however
allowed
me  policeman
who
may
remain
in
the
house
with
me
has
he
come
with
you
to
night
no
his
orders
were
to
stay
in
the
house
again
holmes
raved
in
the
air
why
did
you
come
to
me
he
cried
and
above
all
why
did
you
not
come
at
once  did
not
know
it
was
only
to
day
that  spoke
to
major
prendergast
about
my
troubles
and
was
advised
by
him
to
come
to
you
it
is
really
two
days
since
you
had
the
letter
we
should
have
acted
before
this
you
have
no
further
evidence  suppose
than
that
which
you
have
placed
before
us
no
suggestive
detail
which
might
help
us
there
is
one
thing
said
john
openshaw
he
rummaged
in
his
coat
pocket
and
drawing
out  piece
of
discoloured
blue
tinted
paper
he
laid
it
out
upon
the
table  have
some
remembrance
said
he
that
on
the
day
when
my
uncle
burned
the
papers  observed
that
the
small
unburned
margins
which
lay
amid
the
ashes
were
of
this
particular
colour  found
this
single
sheet
upon
the
floor
of
his
room
and  am
inclined
to
think
that
it
may
be
one
of
the
papers
which
has
perhaps
fluttered
out
from
among
the
others
and
in
that
way
has
escaped
destruction
beyond
the
mention
of
pips  do
not
see
that
it
helps
us
much  think
myself
that
it
is  page
from
some
private
diary
the
writing
is
undoubtedly
my
uncle  holmes
moved
the
lamp
and
we
both
bent
over
the
sheet
of
paper
which
showed
by
its
ragged
edge
that
it
had
indeed
been
torn
from  book
it
was
headed
march
and
beneath
were
the
following
enigmatical
notices
th
hudson
came
same
old
platform
th
set
the
pips
on
mccauley
paramore
and
john
swain
of
st
augustine
th
mccauley
cleared
th
john
swain
cleared
th
visited
paramore
all
well
thank
you
said
holmes
folding
up
the
paper
and
returning
it
to
our
visitor
and
now
you
must
on
no
account
lose
another
instant
we
cannot
spare
time
even
to
discuss
what
you
have
told
me
you
must
get
home
instantly
and
act
what
shall  do
there
is
but
one
thing
to
do
it
must
be
done
at
once
you
must
put
this
piece
of
paper
which
you
have
shown
us
into
the
brass
box
which
you
have
described
you
must
also
put
in  note
to
say
that
all
the
other
papers
were
burned
by
your
uncle
and
that
this
is
the
only
one
which
remains
you
must
assert
that
in
such
words
as
will
carry
conviction
with
them
having
done
this
you
must
at
once
put
the
box
out
upon
the
sundial
as
directed
do
you
understand
entirely
do
not
think
of
revenge
or
anything
of
the
sort
at
present  think
that
we
may
gain
that
by
means
of
the
law
but
we
have
our
web
to
weave
while
theirs
is
already
woven
the
first
consideration
is
to
remove
the
pressing
danger
which
threatens
you
the
second
is
to
clear
up
the
mystery
and
to
punish
the
guilty
parties  thank
you
said
the
young
man
rising
and
pulling
on
his
overcoat
you
have
given
me
fresh
life
and
hope  shall
certainly
do
as
you
advise
do
not
lose
an
instant
and
above
all
take
care
of
yourself
in
the
meanwhile
for  do
not
think
that
there
can
be  doubt
that
you
are
threatened
by  very
real
and
imminent
danger
how
do
you
go
back
by
train
from
waterloo
it
is
not
yet
nine
the
streets
will
be
crowded
so  trust
that
you
may
be
in
safety
and
yet
you
cannot
guard
yourself
too
closely  am
armed
that
is
well
to
morrow  shall
set
to
work
upon
your
case  shall
see
you
at
horsham
then
no
your
secret
lies
in
london
it
is
there
that  shall
seek
it
then  shall
call
upon
you
in  day
or
in
two
days
with
news
as
to
the
box
and
the
papers  shall
take
your
advice
in
every
particular
he
shook
hands
with
us
and
took
his
leave
outside
the
wind
still
screamed
and
the
rain
splashed
and
pattered
against
the
windows
this
strange
wild
story
seemed
to
have
come
to
us
from
amid
the
mad
elements
blown
in
upon
us
like  sheet
of
sea
weed
in  gale
and
now
to
have
been
reabsorbed
by
them
once
more
sherlock
holmes
sat
for
some
time
in
silence
with
his
head
sunk
forward
and
his
eyes
bent
upon
the
red
glow
of
the
fire
then
he
lit
his
pipe
and
leaning
back
in
his
chair
he
watched
the
blue
smoke
rings
as
they
chased
each
other
up
to
the
ceiling  think
watson
he
remarked
at
last
that
of
all
our
cases
we
have
had
none
more
fantastic
than
this
save
perhaps
the
sign
of
four
well
yes
save
perhaps
that
and
yet
this
john
openshaw
seems
to
me
to
be
walking
amid
even
greater
perils
than
did
the
sholtos
but
have
you  asked
formed
any
definite
conception
as
to
what
these
perils
are
there
can
be
no
question
as
to
their
nature
he
answered
then
what
are
they
who
is
this  k  and
why
does
he
pursue
this
unhappy
family
sherlock
holmes
closed
his
eyes
and
placed
his
elbows
upon
the
arms
of
his
chair
with
his
finger
tips
together
the
ideal
reasoner
he
remarked
would
when
he
had
once
been
shown  single
fact
in
all
its
bearings
deduce
from
it
not
only
all
the
chain
of
events
which
led
up
to
it
but
also
all
the
results
which
would
follow
from
it
as
cuvier
could
correctly
describe  whole
animal
by
the
contemplation
of  single
bone
so
the
observer
who
has
thoroughly
understood
one
link
in  series
of
incidents
should
be
able
to
accurately
state
all
the
other
ones
both
before
and
after
we
have
not
yet
grasped
the
results
which
the
reason
alone
can
attain
to
problems
may
be
solved
in
the
study
which
have
baffled
all
those
who
have
sought  solution
by
the
aid
of
their
senses
to
carry
the
art
however
to
its
highest
pitch
it
is
necessary
that
the
reasoner
should
be
able
to
utilise
all
the
facts
which
have
come
to
his
knowledge
and
this
in
itself
implies
as
you
will
readily
see  possession
of
all
knowledge
which
even
in
these
days
of
free
education
and
encyclopaedias
is  somewhat
rare
accomplishment
it
is
not
so
impossible
however
that  man
should
possess
all
knowledge
which
is
likely
to
be
useful
to
him
in
his
work
and
this  have
endeavoured
in
my
case
to
do
if  remember
rightly
you
on
one
occasion
in
the
early
days
of
our
friendship
defined
my
limits
in  very
precise
fashion
yes  answered
laughing
it
was  singular
document
philosophy
astronomy
and
politics
were
marked
at
zero  remember
botany
variable
geology
profound
as
regards
the
mud
stains
from
any
region
within
fifty
miles
of
town
chemistry
eccentric
anatomy
unsystematic
sensational
literature
and
crime
records
unique
violin
player
boxer
swordsman
lawyer
and
self
poisoner
by
cocaine
and
tobacco
those  think
were
the
main
points
of
my
analysis
holmes
grinned
at
the
last
item
well
he
said  say
now
as  said
then
that  man
should
keep
his
little
brain
attic
stocked
with
all
the
furniture
that
he
is
likely
to
use
and
the
rest
he
can
put
away
in
the
lumber
room
of
his
library
where
he
can
get
it
if
he
wants
it
now
for
such  case
as
the
one
which
has
been
submitted
to
us
to
night
we
need
certainly
to
muster
all
our
resources
kindly
hand
me
down
the
letter  of
the
american
encyclopaedia
which
stands
upon
the
shelf
beside
you
thank
you
now
let
us
consider
the
situation
and
see
what
may
be
deduced
from
it
in
the
first
place
we
may
start
with  strong
presumption
that
colonel
openshaw
had
some
very
strong
reason
for
leaving
america
men
at
his
time
of
life
do
not
change
all
their
habits
and
exchange
willingly
the
charming
climate
of
florida
for
the
lonely
life
of
an
english
provincial
town
his
extreme
love
of
solitude
in
england
suggests
the
idea
that
he
was
in
fear
of
someone
or
something
so
we
may
assume
as  working
hypothesis
that
it
was
fear
of
someone
or
something
which
drove
him
from
america
as
to
what
it
was
he
feared
we
can
only
deduce
that
by
considering
the
formidable
letters
which
were
received
by
himself
and
his
successors
did
you
remark
the
postmarks
of
those
letters
the
first
was
from
pondicherry
the
second
from
dundee
and
the
third
from
london
from
east
london
what
do
you
deduce
from
that
they
are
all
seaports
that
the
writer
was
on
board
of  ship
excellent
we
have
already  clue
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
probability
the
strong
probability
is
that
the
writer
was
on
board
of  ship
and
now
let
us
consider
another
point
in
the
case
of
pondicherry
seven
weeks
elapsed
between
the
threat
and
its
fulfilment
in
dundee
it
was
only
some
three
or
four
days
does
that
suggest
anything  greater
distance
to
travel
but
the
letter
had
also  greater
distance
to
come
then  do
not
see
the
point
there
is
at
least  presumption
that
the
vessel
in
which
the
man
or
men
are
is  sailing
ship
it
looks
as
if
they
always
send
their
singular
warning
or
token
before
them
when
starting
upon
their
mission
you
see
how
quickly
the
deed
followed
the
sign
when
it
came
from
dundee
if
they
had
come
from
pondicherry
in  steamer
they
would
have
arrived
almost
as
soon
as
their
letter
but
as  matter
of
fact
seven
weeks
elapsed  think
that
those
seven
weeks
represented
the
difference
between
the
mail
boat
which
brought
the
letter
and
the
sailing
vessel
which
brought
the
writer
it
is
possible
more
than
that
it
is
probable
and
now
you
see
the
deadly
urgency
of
this
new
case
and
why  urged
young
openshaw
to
caution
the
blow
has
always
fallen
at
the
end
of
the
time
which
it
would
take
the
senders
to
travel
the
distance
but
this
one
comes
from
london
and
therefore
we
cannot
count
upon
delay
good
god  cried
what
can
it
mean
this
relentless
persecution
the
papers
which
openshaw
carried
are
obviously
of
vital
importance
to
the
person
or
persons
in
the
sailing
ship  think
that
it
is
quite
clear
that
there
must
be
more
than
one
of
them  single
man
could
not
have
carried
out
two
deaths
in
such  way
as
to
deceive  coroner  jury
there
must
have
been
several
in
it
and
they
must
have
been
men
of
resource
and
determination
their
papers
they
mean
to
have
be
the
holder
of
them
who
it
may
in
this
way
you
see  k  ceases
to
be
the
initials
of
an
individual
and
becomes
the
badge
of  society
but
of
what
society
have
you
never
said
sherlock
holmes
bending
forward
and
sinking
his
voice
have
you
never
heard
of
the
ku
klux
klan  never
have
holmes
turned
over
the
leaves
of
the
book
upon
his
knee
here
it
is
said
he
presently
ku
klux
klan  name
derived
from
the
fanciful
resemblance
to
the
sound
produced
by
cocking  rifle
this
terrible
secret
society
was
formed
by
some
ex
confederate
soldiers
in
the
southern
states
after
the
civil
war
and
it
rapidly
formed
local
branches
in
different
parts
of
the
country
notably
in
tennessee
louisiana
the
carolinas
georgia
and
florida
its
power
was
used
for
political
purposes
principally
for
the
terrorising
of
the
negro
voters
and
the
murdering
and
driving
from
the
country
of
those
who
were
opposed
to
its
views
its
outrages
were
usually
preceded
by  warning
sent
to
the
marked
man
in
some
fantastic
but
generally
recognised
shape  sprig
of
oak
leaves
in
some
parts
melon
seeds
or
orange
pips
in
others
on
receiving
this
the
victim
might
either
openly
abjure
his
former
ways
or
might
fly
from
the
country
if
he
braved
the
matter
out
death
would
unfailingly
come
upon
him
and
usually
in
some
strange
and
unforeseen
manner
so
perfect
was
the
organisation
of
the
society
and
so
systematic
its
methods
that
there
is
hardly  case
upon
record
where
any
man
succeeded
in
braving
it
with
impunity
or
in
which
any
of
its
outrages
were
traced
home
to
the
perpetrators
for
some
years
the
organisation
flourished
in
spite
of
the
efforts
of
the
united
states
government
and
of
the
better
classes
of
the
community
in
the
south
eventually
in
the
year
the
movement
rather
suddenly
collapsed
although
there
have
been
sporadic
outbreaks
of
the
same
sort
since
that
date
you
will
observe
said
holmes
laying
down
the
volume
that
the
sudden
breaking
up
of
the
society
was
coincident
with
the
disappearance
of
openshaw
from
america
with
their
papers
it
may
well
have
been
cause
and
effect
it
is
no
wonder
that
he
and
his
family
have
some
of
the
more
implacable
spirits
upon
their
track
you
can
understand
that
this
register
and
diary
may
implicate
some
of
the
first
men
in
the
south
and
that
there
may
be
many
who
will
not
sleep
easy
at
night
until
it
is
recovered
then
the
page
we
have
seen
is
such
as
we
might
expect
it
ran
if  remember
right
sent
the
pips
to  b
and  that
is
sent
the
society  warning
to
them
then
there
are
successive
entries
that  and  cleared
or
left
the
country
and
finally
that  was
visited
with  fear  sinister
result
for  well  think
doctor
that
we
may
let
some
light
into
this
dark
place
and  believe
that
the
only
chance
young
openshaw
has
in
the
meantime
is
to
do
what  have
told
him
there
is
nothing
more
to
be
said
or
to
be
done
to
night
so
hand
me
over
my
violin
and
let
us
try
to
forget
for
half
an
hour
the
miserable
weather
and
the
still
more
miserable
ways
of
our
fellow
men
it
had
cleared
in
the
morning
and
the
sun
was
shining
with  subdued
brightness
through
the
dim
veil
which
hangs
over
the
great
city
sherlock
holmes
was
already
at
breakfast
when  came
down
you
will
excuse
me
for
not
waiting
for
you
said
he  have  foresee  very
busy
day
before
me
in
looking
into
this
case
of
young
openshaw  what
steps
will
you
take  asked
it
will
very
much
depend
upon
the
results
of
my
first
inquiries  may
have
to
go
down
to
horsham
after
all
you
will
not
go
there
first
no  shall
commence
with
the
city
just
ring
the
bell
and
the
maid
will
bring
up
your
coffee
as  waited  lifted
the
unopened
newspaper
from
the
table
and
glanced
my
eye
over
it
it
rested
upon  heading
which
sent  chill
to
my
heart
holmes  cried
you
are
too
late
ah
said
he
laying
down
his
cup  feared
as
much
how
was
it
done
he
spoke
calmly
but  could
see
that
he
was
deeply
moved
my
eye
caught
the
name
of
openshaw
and
the
heading
tragedy
near
waterloo
bridge
here
is
the
account
between
nine
and
ten
last
night
police
constable
cook
of
the  division
on
duty
near
waterloo
bridge
heard  cry
for
help
and  splash
in
the
water
the
night
however
was
extremely
dark
and
stormy
so
that
in
spite
of
the
help
of
several
passers
by
it
was
quite
impossible
to
effect  rescue
the
alarm
however
was
given
and
by
the
aid
of
the
water
police
the
body
was
eventually
recovered
it
proved
to
be
that
of  young
gentleman
whose
name
as
it
appears
from
an
envelope
which
was
found
in
his
pocket
was
john
openshaw
and
whose
residence
is
near
horsham
it
is
conjectured
that
he
may
have
been
hurrying
down
to
catch
the
last
train
from
waterloo
station
and
that
in
his
haste
and
the
extreme
darkness
he
missed
his
path
and
walked
over
the
edge
of
one
of
the
small
landing
places
for
river
steamboats
the
body
exhibited
no
traces
of
violence
and
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
deceased
had
been
the
victim
of
an
unfortunate
accident
which
should
have
the
effect
of
calling
the
attention
of
the
authorities
to
the
condition
of
the
riverside
landing
stages
we
sat
in
silence
for
some
minutes
holmes
more
depressed
and
shaken
than  had
ever
seen
him
that
hurts
my
pride
watson
he
said
at
last
it
is  petty
feeling
no
doubt
but
it
hurts
my
pride
it
becomes  personal
matter
with
me
now
and
if
god
sends
me
health  shall
set
my
hand
upon
this
gang
that
he
should
come
to
me
for
help
and
that  should
send
him
away
to
his
death
he
sprang
from
his
chair
and
paced
about
the
room
in
uncontrollable
agitation
with  flush
upon
his
sallow
cheeks
and  nervous
clasping
and
unclasping
of
his
long
thin
hands
they
must
be
cunning
devils
he
exclaimed
at
last
how
could
they
have
decoyed
him
down
there
the
embankment
is
not
on
the
direct
line
to
the
station
the
bridge
no
doubt
was
too
crowded
even
on
such  night
for
their
purpose
well
watson
we
shall
see
who
will
win
in
the
long
run  am
going
out
now
to
the
police
no  shall
be
my
own
police
when  have
spun
the
web
they
may
take
the
flies
but
not
before
all
day  was
engaged
in
my
professional
work
and
it
was
late
in
the
evening
before  returned
to
baker
street
sherlock
holmes
had
not
come
back
yet
it
was
nearly
ten  clock
before
he
entered
looking
pale
and
worn
he
walked
up
to
the
sideboard
and
tearing  piece
from
the
loaf
he
devoured
it
voraciously
washing
it
down
with  long
draught
of
water
you
are
hungry  remarked
starving
it
had
escaped
my
memory  have
had
nothing
since
breakfast
nothing
not  bite  had
no
time
to
think
of
it
and
how
have
you
succeeded
well
you
have  clue  have
them
in
the
hollow
of
my
hand
young
openshaw
shall
not
long
remain
unavenged
why
watson
let
us
put
their
own
devilish
trade
mark
upon
them
it
is
well
thought
of
what
do
you
mean
he
took
an
orange
from
the
cupboard
and
tearing
it
to
pieces
he
squeezed
out
the
pips
upon
the
table
of
these
he
took
five
and
thrust
them
into
an
envelope
on
the
inside
of
the
flap
he
wrote  h
for  o
then
he
sealed
it
and
addressed
it
to
captain
james
calhoun
barque
lone
star
savannah
georgia
that
will
await
him
when
he
enters
port
said
he
chuckling
it
may
give
him  sleepless
night
he
will
find
it
as
sure  precursor
of
his
fate
as
openshaw
did
before
him
and
who
is
this
captain
calhoun
the
leader
of
the
gang  shall
have
the
others
but
he
first
how
did
you
trace
it
then
he
took  large
sheet
of
paper
from
his
pocket
all
covered
with
dates
and
names  have
spent
the
whole
day
said
he
over
lloyd  registers
and
files
of
the
old
papers
following
the
future
career
of
every
vessel
which
touched
at
pondicherry
in
january
and
february
in
there
were
thirty
six
ships
of
fair
tonnage
which
were
reported
there
during
those
months
of
these
one
the
lone
star
instantly
attracted
my
attention
since
although
it
was
reported
as
having
cleared
from
london
the
name
is
that
which
is
given
to
one
of
the
states
of
the
union
texas  think  was
not
and
am
not
sure
which
but  knew
that
the
ship
must
have
an
american
origin
what
then  searched
the
dundee
records
and
when  found
that
the
barque
lone
star
was
there
in
january
my
suspicion
became  certainty  then
inquired
as
to
the
vessels
which
lay
at
present
in
the
port
of
london
yes
the
lone
star
had
arrived
here
last
week  went
down
to
the
albert
dock
and
found
that
she
had
been
taken
down
the
river
by
the
early
tide
this
morning
homeward
bound
to
savannah  wired
to
gravesend
and
learned
that
she
had
passed
some
time
ago
and
as
the
wind
is
easterly  have
no
doubt
that
she
is
now
past
the
goodwins
and
not
very
far
from
the
isle
of
wight
what
will
you
do
then
oh  have
my
hand
upon
him
he
and
the
two
mates
are
as  learn
the
only
native
born
americans
in
the
ship
the
others
are
finns
and
germans  know
also
that
they
were
all
three
away
from
the
ship
last
night  had
it
from
the
stevedore
who
has
been
loading
their
cargo
by
the
time
that
their
sailing
ship
reaches
savannah
the
mail
boat
will
have
carried
this
letter
and
the
cable
will
have
informed
the
police
of
savannah
that
these
three
gentlemen
are
badly
wanted
here
upon  charge
of
murder
there
is
ever  flaw
however
in
the
best
laid
of
human
plans
and
the
murderers
of
john
openshaw
were
never
to
receive
the
orange
pips
which
would
show
them
that
another
as
cunning
and
as
resolute
as
themselves
was
upon
their
track
very
long
and
very
severe
were
the
equinoctial
gales
that
year
we
waited
long
for
news
of
the
lone
star
of
savannah
but
none
ever
reached
us
we
did
at
last
hear
that
somewhere
far
out
in
the
atlantic  shattered
stern
post
of  boat
was
seen
swinging
in
the
trough
of  wave
with
the
letters  s
carved
upon
it
and
that
is
all
which
we
shall
ever
know
of
the
fate
of
the
lone
star
adventure
vi
the
man
with
the
twisted
lip
isa
whitney
brother
of
the
late
elias
whitney  d
principal
of
the
theological
college
of
st
george  was
much
addicted
to
opium
the
habit
grew
upon
him
as  understand
from
some
foolish
freak
when
he
was
at
college
for
having
read
de
quincey  description
of
his
dreams
and
sensations
he
had
drenched
his
tobacco
with
laudanum
in
an
attempt
to
produce
the
same
effects
he
found
as
so
many
more
have
done
that
the
practice
is
easier
to
attain
than
to
get
rid
of
and
for
many
years
he
continued
to
be  slave
to
the
drug
an
object
of
mingled
horror
and
pity
to
his
friends
and
relatives  can
see
him
now
with
yellow
pasty
face
drooping
lids
and
pin
point
pupils
all
huddled
in  chair
the
wreck
and
ruin
of  noble
man
one
night
it
was
in
june
there
came  ring
to
my
bell
about
the
hour
when  man
gives
his
first
yawn
and
glances
at
the
clock  sat
up
in
my
chair
and
my
wife
laid
her
needle
work
down
in
her
lap
and
made  little
face
of
disappointment  patient
said
she
you
ll
have
to
go
out  groaned
for  was
newly
come
back
from  weary
day
we
heard
the
door
open  few
hurried
words
and
then
quick
steps
upon
the
linoleum
our
own
door
flew
open
and  lady
clad
in
some
dark
coloured
stuff
with  black
veil
entered
the
room
you
will
excuse
my
calling
so
late
she
began
and
then
suddenly
losing
her
self
control
she
ran
forward
threw
her
arms
about
my
wife  neck
and
sobbed
upon
her
shoulder
oh  m
in
such
trouble
she
cried  do
so
want  little
help
why
said
my
wife
pulling
up
her
veil
it
is
kate
whitney
how
you
startled
me
kate  had
not
an
idea
who
you
were
when
you
came
in  didn  know
what
to
do
so  came
straight
to
you
that
was
always
the
way
folk
who
were
in
grief
came
to
my
wife
like
birds
to  light
house
it
was
very
sweet
of
you
to
come
now
you
must
have
some
wine
and
water
and
sit
here
comfortably
and
tell
us
all
about
it
or
should
you
rather
that  sent
james
off
to
bed
oh
no
no  want
the
doctor  advice
and
help
too
it  about
isa
he
has
not
been
home
for
two
days  am
so
frightened
about
him
it
was
not
the
first
time
that
she
had
spoken
to
us
of
her
husband  trouble
to
me
as  doctor
to
my
wife
as
an
old
friend
and
school
companion
we
soothed
and
comforted
her
by
such
words
as
we
could
find
did
she
know
where
her
husband
was
was
it
possible
that
we
could
bring
him
back
to
her
it
seems
that
it
was
she
had
the
surest
information
that
of
late
he
had
when
the
fit
was
on
him
made
use
of
an
opium
den
in
the
farthest
east
of
the
city
hitherto
his
orgies
had
always
been
confined
to
one
day
and
he
had
come
back
twitching
and
shattered
in
the
evening
but
now
the
spell
had
been
upon
him
eight
and
forty
hours
and
he
lay
there
doubtless
among
the
dregs
of
the
docks
breathing
in
the
poison
or
sleeping
off
the
effects
there
he
was
to
be
found
she
was
sure
of
it
at
the
bar
of
gold
in
upper
swandam
lane
but
what
was
she
to
do
how
could
she  young
and
timid
woman
make
her
way
into
such  place
and
pluck
her
husband
out
from
among
the
ruffians
who
surrounded
him
there
was
the
case
and
of
course
there
was
but
one
way
out
of
it
might  not
escort
her
to
this
place
and
then
as  second
thought
why
should
she
come
at
all  was
isa
whitney  medical
adviser
and
as
such  had
influence
over
him  could
manage
it
better
if  were
alone  promised
her
on
my
word
that  would
send
him
home
in  cab
within
two
hours
if
he
were
indeed
at
the
address
which
she
had
given
me
and
so
in
ten
minutes  had
left
my
armchair
and
cheery
sitting
room
behind
me
and
was
speeding
eastward
in  hansom
on  strange
errand
as
it
seemed
to
me
at
the
time
though
the
future
only
could
show
how
strange
it
was
to
be
but
there
was
no
great
difficulty
in
the
first
stage
of
my
adventure
upper
swandam
lane
is  vile
alley
lurking
behind
the
high
wharves
which
line
the
north
side
of
the
river
to
the
east
of
london
bridge
between  slop
shop
and  gin
shop
approached
by  steep
flight
of
steps
leading
down
to  black
gap
like
the
mouth
of  cave  found
the
den
of
which  was
in
search
ordering
my
cab
to
wait  passed
down
the
steps
worn
hollow
in
the
centre
by
the
ceaseless
tread
of
drunken
feet
and
by
the
light
of  flickering
oil
lamp
above
the
door  found
the
latch
and
made
my
way
into  long
low
room
thick
and
heavy
with
the
brown
opium
smoke
and
terraced
with
wooden
berths
like
the
forecastle
of
an
emigrant
ship
through
the
gloom
one
could
dimly
catch  glimpse
of
bodies
lying
in
strange
fantastic
poses
bowed
shoulders
bent
knees
heads
thrown
back
and
chins
pointing
upward
with
here
and
there  dark
lack
lustre
eye
turned
upon
the
newcomer
out
of
the
black
shadows
there
glimmered
little
red
circles
of
light
now
bright
now
faint
as
the
burning
poison
waxed
or
waned
in
the
bowls
of
the
metal
pipes
the
most
lay
silent
but
some
muttered
to
themselves
and
others
talked
together
in  strange
low
monotonous
voice
their
conversation
coming
in
gushes
and
then
suddenly
tailing
off
into
silence
each
mumbling
out
his
own
thoughts
and
paying
little
heed
to
the
words
of
his
neighbour
at
the
farther
end
was  small
brazier
of
burning
charcoal
beside
which
on  three
legged
wooden
stool
there
sat  tall
thin
old
man
with
his
jaw
resting
upon
his
two
fists
and
his
elbows
upon
his
knees
staring
into
the
fire
as  entered  sallow
malay
attendant
had
hurried
up
with  pipe
for
me
and  supply
of
the
drug
beckoning
me
to
an
empty
berth
thank
you  have
not
come
to
stay
said  there
is  friend
of
mine
here
mr
isa
whitney
and  wish
to
speak
with
him
there
was  movement
and
an
exclamation
from
my
right
and
peering
through
the
gloom  saw
whitney
pale
haggard
and
unkempt
staring
out
at
me
my
god
it  watson
said
he
he
was
in  pitiable
state
of

for
myself  walked
down
the
narrow
passage
between
the
double
row
of
sleepers
holding
my
breath
to
keep
out
the
vile
stupefying
fumes
of
the
drug
and
looking
about
for
the
manager
as  passed
the
tall
man
who
sat
by
the
brazier  felt  sudden
pluck
at
my
skirt
and  low
voice
whispered
walk
past
me
and
then
look
back
at
me
the
words
fell
quite
distinctly
upon
my
ear  glanced
down
they
could
only
have
come
from
the
old
man
at
my
side
and
yet
he
sat
now
as
absorbed
as
ever
very
thin
very
wrinkled
bent
with
age
an
opium
pipe
dangling
down
from
between
his
knees
as
though
it
had
dropped
in
sheer
lassitude
from
his
fingers  took
two
steps
forward
and
looked
back
it
took
all
my
self
control
to
prevent
me
from
breaking
out
into  cry
of
astonishment
he
had
turned
his
back
so
that
none
could
see
him
but  his
form
had
filled
out
his
wrinkles
were
gone
the
dull
eyes
had
regained
their
fire
and
there
sitting
by
the
fire
and
grinning
at
my
surprise
was
none
other
than
sherlock
holmes
he
made  slight
motion
to
me
to
approach
him
and
instantly
as
he
turned
his
face
half
round
to
the
company
once
more
subsided
into  doddering
loose
lipped
senility
holmes  whispered
what
on
earth
are
you
doing
in
this
den
as
low
as
you
can
he
answered  have
excellent
ears
if
you
would
have
the
great
kindness
to
get
rid
of
that
sottish
friend
of
yours  should
be
exceedingly
glad
to
have  little
talk
with
you  have  cab
outside
then
pray
send
him
home
in
it
you
may
safely
trust
him
for
he
appears
to
be
too
limp
to
get
into
any
mischief  should
recommend
you
also
to
send  note
by
the
cabman
to
your
wife
to
say
that
you
have
thrown
in
your
lot
with
me
if
you
will
wait
outside  shall
be
with
you
in
five
minutes
it
was
difficult
to
refuse
any
of
sherlock
holmes
requests
for
they
were
always
so
exceedingly
definite
and
put
forward
with
such  quiet
air
of
mastery  felt
however
that
when
whitney
was
once
confined
in
the
cab
my
mission
was
practically
accomplished
and
for
the
rest  could
not
wish
anything
better
than
to
be
associated
with
my
friend
in
one
of
those
singular
adventures
which
were
the
normal
condition
of
his
existence
in  few
minutes  had
written
my
note
paid
whitney  bill
led
him
out
to
the
cab
and
seen
him
driven
through
the
darkness
in  very
short
time  decrepit
figure
had
emerged
from
the
opium
den
and  was
walking
down
the
street
with
sherlock
holmes
for
two
streets
he
shuffled
along
with  bent
back
and
an
uncertain
foot
then
glancing
quickly
round
he
straightened
himself
out
and
burst
into  hearty
fit
of
laughter  suppose
watson
said
he
that
you
imagine
that  have
added
opium
smoking
to
cocaine
injections
and
all
the
other
little
weaknesses
on
which
you
have
favoured
me
with
your
medical
views  was
certainly
surprised
to
find
you
there
but
not
more
so
than  to
find
you  came
to
find  friend
and  to
find
an
enemy
an
enemy
yes
one
of
my
natural
enemies
or
shall  say
my
natural
prey
briefly
watson  am
in
the
midst
of  very
remarkable
inquiry
and  have
hoped
to
find  clue
in
the
incoherent
ramblings
of
these
sots
as  have
done
before
now
had  been
recognised
in
that
den
my
life
would
not
have
been
worth
an
hour  purchase
for  have
used
it
before
now
for
my
own
purposes
and
the
rascally
lascar
who
runs
it
has
sworn
to
have
vengeance
upon
me
there
is  trap
door
at
the
back
of
that
building
near
the
corner
of
paul  wharf
which
could
tell
some
strange
tales
of
what
has
passed
through
it
upon
the
moonless
nights
what
you
do
not
mean
bodies
ay
bodies
watson
we
should
be
rich
men
if
we
had
for
every
poor
devil
who
has
been
done
to
death
in
that
den
it
is
the
vilest
murder
trap
on
the
whole
riverside
and  fear
that
neville
st
clair
has
entered
it
never
to
leave
it
more
but
our
trap
should
be
here
he
put
his
two
forefingers
between
his
teeth
and
whistled
shrilly  signal
which
was
answered
by  similar
whistle
from
the
distance
followed
shortly
by
the
rattle
of
wheels
and
the
clink
of
horses
hoofs
now
watson
said
holmes
as  tall
dog
cart
dashed
up
through
the
gloom
throwing
out
two
golden
tunnels
of
yellow
light
from
its
side
lanterns
you
ll
come
with
me
won  you
if  can
be
of
use
oh  trusty
comrade
is
always
of
use
and  chronicler
still
more
so
my
room
at
the
cedars
is  double
bedded
one
the
cedars
yes
that
is
mr
st
clair  house  am
staying
there
while  conduct
the
inquiry
where
is
it
then
near
lee
in
kent
we
have  seven
mile
drive
before
us
but  am
all
in
the
dark
of
course
you
are
you
ll
know
all
about
it
presently
jump
up
here
all
right
john
we
shall
not
need
you
here  half  crown
look
out
for
me
to
morrow
about
eleven
give
her
her
head
so
long
then
he
flicked
the
horse
with
his
whip
and
we
dashed
away
through
the
endless
succession
of
sombre
and
deserted
streets
which
widened
gradually
until
we
were
flying
across  broad
balustraded
bridge
with
the
murky
river
flowing
sluggishly
beneath
us
beyond
lay
another
dull
wilderness
of
bricks
and
mortar
its
silence
broken
only
by
the
heavy
regular
footfall
of
the
policeman
or
the
songs
and
shouts
of
some
belated
party
of
revellers  dull
wrack
was
drifting
slowly
across
the
sky
and  star
or
two
twinkled
dimly
here
and
there
through
the
rifts
of
the
clouds
holmes
drove
in
silence
with
his
head
sunk
upon
his
breast
and
the
air
of  man
who
is
lost
in
thought
while  sat
beside
him
curious
to
learn
what
this
new
quest
might
be
which
seemed
to
tax
his
powers
so
sorely
and
yet
afraid
to
break
in
upon
the
current
of
his
thoughts
we
had
driven
several
miles
and
were
beginning
to
get
to
the
fringe
of
the
belt
of
suburban
villas
when
he
shook
himself
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
lit
up
his
pipe
with
the
air
of  man
who
has
satisfied
himself
that
he
is
acting
for
the
best
you
have  grand
gift
of
silence
watson
said
he
it
makes
you
quite
invaluable
as  companion
pon
my
word
it
is  great
thing
for
me
to
have
someone
to
talk
to
for
my
own
thoughts
are
not
over
pleasant  was
wondering
what  should
say
to
this
dear
little
woman
to
night
when
she
meets
me
at
the
door
you
forget
that  know
nothing
about
it  shall
just
have
time
to
tell
you
the
facts
of
the
case
before
we
get
to
lee
it
seems
absurdly
simple
and
yet
somehow  can
get
nothing
to
go
upon
there  plenty
of
thread
no
doubt
but  can  get
the
end
of
it
into
my
hand
now  ll
state
the
case
clearly
and
concisely
to
you
watson
and
maybe
you
can
see  spark
where
all
is
dark
to
me
proceed
then
some
years
ago
to
be
definite
in
may
there
came
to
lee  gentleman
neville
st
clair
by
name
who
appeared
to
have
plenty
of
money
he
took  large
villa
laid
out
the
grounds
very
nicely
and
lived
generally
in
good
style
by
degrees
he
made
friends
in
the
neighbourhood
and
in
he
married
the
daughter
of  local
brewer
by
whom
he
now
has
two
children
he
had
no
occupation
but
was
interested
in
several
companies
and
went
into
town
as  rule
in
the
morning
returning
by
the
from
cannon
street
every
night
mr
st
clair
is
now
thirty
seven
years
of
age
is  man
of
temperate
habits  good
husband  very
affectionate
father
and  man
who
is
popular
with
all
who
know
him  may
add
that
his
whole
debts
at
the
present
moment
as
far
as
we
have
been
able
to
ascertain
amount
to  while
he
has
standing
to
his
credit
in
the
capital
and
counties
bank
there
is
no
reason
therefore
to
think
that
money
troubles
have
been
weighing
upon
his
mind
last
monday
mr
neville
st
clair
went
into
town
rather
earlier
than
usual
remarking
before
he
started
that
he
had
two
important
commissions
to
perform
and
that
he
would
bring
his
little
boy
home  box
of
bricks
now
by
the
merest
chance
his
wife
received  telegram
upon
this
same
monday
very
shortly
after
his
departure
to
the
effect
that  small
parcel
of
considerable
value
which
she
had
been
expecting
was
waiting
for
her
at
the
offices
of
the
aberdeen
shipping
company
now
if
you
are
well
up
in
your
london
you
will
know
that
the
office
of
the
company
is
in
fresno
street
which
branches
out
of
upper
swandam
lane
where
you
found
me
to
night
mrs
st
clair
had
her
lunch
started
for
the
city
did
some
shopping
proceeded
to
the
company  office
got
her
packet
and
found
herself
at
exactly
walking
through
swandam
lane
on
her
way
back
to
the
station
have
you
followed
me
so
far
it
is
very
clear
if
you
remember
monday
was
an
exceedingly
hot
day
and
mrs
st
clair
walked
slowly
glancing
about
in
the
hope
of
seeing  cab
as
she
did
not
like
the
neighbourhood
in
which
she
found
herself
while
she
was
walking
in
this
way
down
swandam
lane
she
suddenly
heard
an
ejaculation
or
cry
and
was
struck
cold
to
see
her
husband
looking
down
at
her
and
as
it
seemed
to
her
beckoning
to
her
from  second
floor
window
the
window
was
open
and
she
distinctly
saw
his
face
which
she
describes
as
being
terribly
agitated
he
waved
his
hands
frantically
to
her
and
then
vanished
from
the
window
so
suddenly
that
it
seemed
to
her
that
he
had
been
plucked
back
by
some
irresistible
force
from
behind
one
singular
point
which
struck
her
quick
feminine
eye
was
that
although
he
wore
some
dark
coat
such
as
he
had
started
to
town
in
he
had
on
neither
collar
nor
necktie
convinced
that
something
was
amiss
with
him
she
rushed
down
the
steps
for
the
house
was
none
other
than
the
opium
den
in
which
you
found
me
to
night
and
running
through
the
front
room
she
attempted
to
ascend
the
stairs
which
led
to
the
first
floor
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
however
she
met
this
lascar
scoundrel
of
whom  have
spoken
who
thrust
her
back
and
aided
by  dane
who
acts
as
assistant
there
pushed
her
out
into
the
street
filled
with
the
most
maddening
doubts
and
fears
she
rushed
down
the
lane
and
by
rare
good
fortune
met
in
fresno
street  number
of
constables
with
an
inspector
all
on
their
way
to
their
beat
the
inspector
and
two
men
accompanied
her
back
and
in
spite
of
the
continued
resistance
of
the
proprietor
they
made
their
way
to
the
room
in
which
mr
st
clair
had
last
been
seen
there
was
no
sign
of
him
there
in
fact
in
the
whole
of
that
floor
there
was
no
one
to
be
found
save  crippled
wretch
of
hideous
aspect
who
it
seems
made
his
home
there
both
he
and
the
lascar
stoutly
swore
that
no
one
else
had
been
in
the
front
room
during
the
afternoon
so
determined
was
their
denial
that
the
inspector
was
staggered
and
had
almost
come
to
believe
that
mrs
st
clair
had
been
deluded
when
with  cry
she
sprang
at  small
deal
box
which
lay
upon
the
table
and
tore
the
lid
from
it
out
there
fell  cascade
of
children  bricks
it
was
the
toy
which
he
had
promised
to
bring
home
this
discovery
and
the
evident
confusion
which
the
cripple
showed
made
the
inspector
realise
that
the
matter
was
serious
the
rooms
were
carefully
examined
and
results
all
pointed
to
an
abominable
crime
the
front
room
was
plainly
furnished
as  sitting
room
and
led
into  small
bedroom
which
looked
out
upon
the
back
of
one
of
the
wharves
between
the
wharf
and
the
bedroom
window
is  narrow
strip
which
is
dry
at
low
tide
but
is
covered
at
high
tide
with
at
least
four
and  half
feet
of
water
the
bedroom
window
was  broad
one
and
opened
from
below
on
examination
traces
of
blood
were
to
be
seen
upon
the
windowsill
and
several
scattered
drops
were
visible
upon
the
wooden
floor
of
the
bedroom
thrust
away
behind  curtain
in
the
front
room
were
all
the
clothes
of
mr
neville
st
clair
with
the
exception
of
his
coat
his
boots
his
socks
his
hat
and
his
watch
all
were
there
there
were
no
signs
of
violence
upon
any
of
these
garments
and
there
were
no
other
traces
of
mr
neville
st
clair
out
of
the
window
he
must
apparently
have
gone
for
no
other
exit
could
be
discovered
and
the
ominous
bloodstains
upon
the
sill
gave
little
promise
that
he
could
save
himself
by
swimming
for
the
tide
was
at
its
very
highest
at
the
moment
of
the
tragedy
and
now
as
to
the
villains
who
seemed
to
be
immediately
implicated
in
the
matter
the
lascar
was
known
to
be  man
of
the
vilest
antecedents
but
as
by
mrs
st
clair  story
he
was
known
to
have
been
at
the
foot
of
the
stair
within  very
few
seconds
of
her
husband  appearance
at
the
window
he
could
hardly
have
been
more
than
an
accessory
to
the
crime
his
defence
was
one
of
absolute
ignorance
and
he
protested
that
he
had
no
knowledge
as
to
the
doings
of
hugh
boone
his
lodger
and
that
he
could
not
account
in
any
way
for
the
presence
of
the
missing
gentleman  clothes
so
much
for
the
lascar
manager
now
for
the
sinister
cripple
who
lives
upon
the
second
floor
of
the
opium
den
and
who
was
certainly
the
last
human
being
whose
eyes
rested
upon
neville
st
clair
his
name
is
hugh
boone
and
his
hideous
face
is
one
which
is
familiar
to
every
man
who
goes
much
to
the
city
he
is  professional
beggar
though
in
order
to
avoid
the
police
regulations
he
pretends
to  small
trade
in
wax
vestas
some
little
distance
down
threadneedle
street
upon
the
left
hand
side
there
is
as
you
may
have
remarked  small
angle
in
the
wall
here
it
is
that
this
creature
takes
his
daily
seat
cross
legged
with
his
tiny
stock
of
matches
on
his
lap
and
as
he
is  piteous
spectacle  small
rain
of
charity
descends
into
the
greasy
leather
cap
which
lies
upon
the
pavement
beside
him  have
watched
the
fellow
more
than
once
before
ever  thought
of
making
his
professional
acquaintance
and  have
been
surprised
at
the
harvest
which
he
has
reaped
in  short
time
his
appearance
you
see
is
so
remarkable
that
no
one
can
pass
him
without
observing
him  shock
of
orange
hair  pale
face
disfigured
by  horrible
scar
which
by
its
contraction
has
turned
up
the
outer
edge
of
his
upper
lip  bulldog
chin
and  pair
of
very
penetrating
dark
eyes
which
present  singular
contrast
to
the
colour
of
his
hair
all
mark
him
out
from
amid
the
common
crowd
of
mendicants
and
so
too
does
his
wit
for
he
is
ever
ready
with  reply
to
any
piece
of
chaff
which
may
be
thrown
at
him
by
the
passers
by
this
is
the
man
whom
we
now
learn
to
have
been
the
lodger
at
the
opium
den
and
to
have
been
the
last
man
to
see
the
gentleman
of
whom
we
are
in
quest
but  cripple
said  what
could
he
have
done
single
handed
against  man
in
the
prime
of
life
he
is  cripple
in
the
sense
that
he
walks
with  limp
but
in
other
respects
he
appears
to
be  powerful
and
well
nurtured
man
surely
your
medical
experience
would
tell
you
watson
that
weakness
in
one
limb
is
often
compensated
for
by
exceptional
strength
in
the
others
pray
continue
your
narrative
mrs
st
clair
had
fainted
at
the
sight
of
the
blood
upon
the
window
and
she
was
escorted
home
in  cab
by
the
police
as
her
presence
could
be
of
no
help
to
them
in
their
investigations
inspector
barton
who
had
charge
of
the
case
made  very
careful
examination
of
the
premises
but
without
finding
anything
which
threw
any
light
upon
the
matter
one
mistake
had
been
made
in
not
arresting
boone
instantly
as
he
was
allowed
some
few
minutes
during
which
he
might
have
communicated
with
his
friend
the
lascar
but
this
fault
was
soon
remedied
and
he
was
seized
and
searched
without
anything
being
found
which
could
incriminate
him
there
were
it
is
true
some
blood
stains
upon
his
right
shirt
sleeve
but
he
pointed
to
his
ring
finger
which
had
been
cut
near
the
nail
and
explained
that
the
bleeding
came
from
there
adding
that
he
had
been
to
the
window
not
long
before
and
that
the
stains
which
had
been
observed
there
came
doubtless
from
the
same
source
he
denied
strenuously
having
ever
seen
mr
neville
st
clair
and
swore
that
the
presence
of
the
clothes
in
his
room
was
as
much  mystery
to
him
as
to
the
police
as
to
mrs
st
clair  assertion
that
she
had
actually
seen
her
husband
at
the
window
he
declared
that
she
must
have
been
either
mad
or
dreaming
he
was
removed
loudly
protesting
to
the
police
station
while
the
inspector
remained
upon
the
premises
in
the
hope
that
the
ebbing
tide
might
afford
some
fresh
clue
and
it
did
though
they
hardly
found
upon
the
mud
bank
what
they
had
feared
to
find
it
was
neville
st
clair  coat
and
not
neville
st
clair
which
lay
uncovered
as
the
tide
receded
and
what
do
you
think
they
found
in
the
pockets  cannot
imagine
no  don  think
you
would
guess
every
pocket
stuffed
with
pennies
and
half
pennies
pennies
and
half
pennies
it
was
no
wonder
that
it
had
not
been
swept
away
by
the
tide
but  human
body
is  different
matter
there
is  fierce
eddy
between
the
wharf
and
the
house
it
seemed
likely
enough
that
the
weighted
coat
had
remained
when
the
stripped
body
had
been
sucked
away
into
the
river
but  understand
that
all
the
other
clothes
were
found
in
the
room
would
the
body
be
dressed
in  coat
alone
no
sir
but
the
facts
might
be
met
speciously
enough
suppose
that
this
man
boone
had
thrust
neville
st
clair
through
the
window
there
is
no
human
eye
which
could
have
seen
the
deed
what
would
he
do
then
it
would
of
course
instantly
strike
him
that
he
must
get
rid
of
the
tell
tale
garments
he
would
seize
the
coat
then
and
be
in
the
act
of
throwing
it
out
when
it
would
occur
to
him
that
it
would
swim
and
not
sink
he
has
little
time
for
he
has
heard
the
scuffle
downstairs
when
the
wife
tried
to
force
her
way
up
and
perhaps
he
has
already
heard
from
his
lascar
confederate
that
the
police
are
hurrying
up
the
street
there
is
not
an
instant
to
be
lost
he
rushes
to
some
secret
hoard
where
he
has
accumulated
the
fruits
of
his
beggary
and
he
stuffs
all
the
coins
upon
which
he
can
lay
his
hands
into
the
pockets
to
make
sure
of
the
coat  sinking
he
throws
it
out
and
would
have
done
the
same
with
the
other
garments
had
not
he
heard
the
rush
of
steps
below
and
only
just
had
time
to
close
the
window
when
the
police
appeared
it
certainly
sounds
feasible
well
we
will
take
it
as  working
hypothesis
for
want
of  better
boone
as  have
told
you
was
arrested
and
taken
to
the
station
but
it
could
not
be
shown
that
there
had
ever
before
been
anything
against
him
he
had
for
years
been
known
as  professional
beggar
but
his
life
appeared
to
have
been  very
quiet
and
innocent
one
there
the
matter
stands
at
present
and
the
questions
which
have
to
be
solved
what
neville
st
clair
was
doing
in
the
opium
den
what
happened
to
him
when
there
where
is
he
now
and
what
hugh
boone
had
to
do
with
his
disappearance
are
all
as
far
from  solution
as
ever  confess
that  cannot
recall
any
case
within
my
experience
which
looked
at
the
first
glance
so
simple
and
yet
which
presented
such
difficulties
while
sherlock
holmes
had
been
detailing
this
singular
series
of
events
we
had
been
whirling
through
the
outskirts
of
the
great
town
until
the
last
straggling
houses
had
been
left
behind
and
we
rattled
along
with  country
hedge
upon
either
side
of
us
just
as
he
finished
however
we
drove
through
two
scattered
villages
where  few
lights
still
glimmered
in
the
windows
we
are
on
the
outskirts
of
lee
said
my
companion
we
have
touched
on
three
english
counties
in
our
short
drive
starting
in
middlesex
passing
over
an
angle
of
surrey
and
ending
in
kent
see
that
light
among
the
trees
that
is
the
cedars
and
beside
that
lamp
sits  woman
whose
anxious
ears
have
already  have
little
doubt
caught
the
clink
of
our
horse  feet
but
why
are
you
not
conducting
the
case
from
baker
street  asked
because
there
are
many
inquiries
which
must
be
made
out
here
mrs
st
clair
has
most
kindly
put
two
rooms
at
my
disposal
and
you
may
rest
assured
that
she
will
have
nothing
but  welcome
for
my
friend
and
colleague  hate
to
meet
her
watson
when  have
no
news
of
her
husband
here
we
are
whoa
there
whoa
we
had
pulled
up
in
front
of  large
villa
which
stood
within
its
own
grounds  stable
boy
had
run
out
to
the
horse  head
and
springing
down  followed
holmes
up
the
small
winding
gravel
drive
which
led
to
the
house
as
we
approached
the
door
flew
open
and  little
blonde
woman
stood
in
the
opening
clad
in
some
sort
of
light
mousseline
de
soie
with  touch
of
fluffy
pink
chiffon
at
her
neck
and
wrists
she
stood
with
her
figure
outlined
against
the
flood
of
light
one
hand
upon
the
door
one
half
raised
in
her
eagerness
her
body
slightly
bent
her
head
and
face
protruded
with
eager
eyes
and
parted
lips  standing
question
well
she
cried
well
and
then
seeing
that
there
were
two
of
us
she
gave  cry
of
hope
which
sank
into  groan
as
she
saw
that
my
companion
shook
his
head
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
no
good
news
none
no
bad
no
thank
god
for
that
but
come
in
you
must
be
weary
for
you
have
had  long
day
this
is
my
friend
dr
watson
he
has
been
of
most
vital
use
to
me
in
several
of
my
cases
and  lucky
chance
has
made
it
possible
for
me
to
bring
him
out
and
associate
him
with
this
investigation  am
delighted
to
see
you
said
she
pressing
my
hand
warmly
you
will  am
sure
forgive
anything
that
may
be
wanting
in
our
arrangements
when
you
consider
the
blow
which
has
come
so
suddenly
upon
us
my
dear
madam
said  i
am
an
old
campaigner
and
if  were
not  can
very
well
see
that
no
apology
is
needed
if  can
be
of
any
assistance
either
to
you
or
to
my
friend
here  shall
be
indeed
happy
now
mr
sherlock
holmes
said
the
lady
as
we
entered  well
lit
dining
room
upon
the
table
of
which  cold
supper
had
been
laid
out  should
very
much
like
to
ask
you
one
or
two
plain
questions
to
which  beg
that
you
will
give  plain
answer
certainly
madam
do
not
trouble
about
my
feelings  am
not
hysterical
nor
given
to
fainting  simply
wish
to
hear
your
real
real
opinion
upon
what
point
in
your
heart
of
hearts
do
you
think
that
neville
is
alive
sherlock
holmes
seemed
to
be
embarrassed
by
the
question
frankly
now
she
repeated
standing
upon
the
rug
and
looking
keenly
down
at
him
as
he
leaned
back
in  basket
chair
frankly
then
madam  do
not
you
think
that
he
is
dead  do
murdered  don  say
that
perhaps
and
on
what
day
did
he
meet
his
death
on
monday
then
perhaps
mr
holmes
you
will
be
good
enough
to
explain
how
it
is
that  have
received  letter
from
him
to
day
sherlock
holmes
sprang
out
of
his
chair
as
if
he
had
been
galvanised
what
he
roared
yes
to
day
she
stood
smiling
holding
up  little
slip
of
paper
in
the
air
may  see
it
certainly
he
snatched
it
from
her
in
his
eagerness
and
smoothing
it
out
upon
the
table
he
drew
over
the
lamp
and
examined
it
intently  had
left
my
chair
and
was
gazing
at
it
over
his
shoulder
the
envelope
was  very
coarse
one
and
was
stamped
with
the
gravesend
postmark
and
with
the
date
of
that
very
day
or
rather
of
the
day
before
for
it
was
considerably
after
midnight
coarse
writing
murmured
holmes
surely
this
is
not
your
husband  writing
madam
no
but
the
enclosure
is  perceive
also
that
whoever
addressed
the
envelope
had
to
go
and
inquire
as
to
the
address
how
can
you
tell
that
the
name
you
see
is
in
perfectly
black
ink
which
has
dried
itself
the
rest
is
of
the
greyish
colour
which
shows
that
blotting
paper
has
been
used
if
it
had
been
written
straight
off
and
then
blotted
none
would
be
of  deep
black
shade
this
man
has
written
the
name
and
there
has
then
been  pause
before
he
wrote
the
address
which
can
only
mean
that
he
was
not
familiar
with
it
it
is
of
course  trifle
but
there
is
nothing
so
important
as
trifles
let
us
now
see
the
letter
ha
there
has
been
an
enclosure
here
yes
there
was  ring
his
signet
ring
and
you
are
sure
that
this
is
your
husband  hand
one
of
his
hands
one
his
hand
when
he
wrote
hurriedly
it
is
very
unlike
his
usual
writing
and
yet  know
it
well
dearest
do
not
be
frightened
all
will
come
well
there
is  huge
error
which
it
may
take
some
little
time
to
rectify
wait
in
patience
neville
written
in
pencil
upon
the
fly
leaf
of  book
octavo
size
no
water
mark
hum
posted
to
day
in
gravesend
by  man
with  dirty
thumb
ha
and
the
flap
has
been
gummed
if  am
not
very
much
in
error
by  person
who
had
been
chewing
tobacco
and
you
have
no
doubt
that
it
is
your
husband  hand
madam
none
neville
wrote
those
words
and
they
were
posted
to
day
at
gravesend
well
mrs
st
clair
the
clouds
lighten
though  should
not
venture
to
say
that
the
danger
is
over
but
he
must
be
alive
mr
holmes
unless
this
is  clever
forgery
to
put
us
on
the
wrong
scent
the
ring
after
all
proves
nothing
it
may
have
been
taken
from
him
no
no
it
is
it
is
his
very
own
writing
very
well
it
may
however
have
been
written
on
monday
and
only
posted
to
day
that
is
possible
if
so
much
may
have
happened
between
oh
you
must
not
discourage
me
mr
holmes  know
that
all
is
well
with
him
there
is
so
keen  sympathy
between
us
that  should
know
if
evil
came
upon
him
on
the
very
day
that  saw
him
last
he
cut
himself
in
the
bedroom
and
yet  in
the
dining
room
rushed
upstairs
instantly
with
the
utmost
certainty
that
something
had
happened
do
you
think
that  would
respond
to
such  trifle
and
yet
be
ignorant
of
his
death  have
seen
too
much
not
to
know
that
the
impression
of  woman
may
be
more
valuable
than
the
conclusion
of
an
analytical
reasoner
and
in
this
letter
you
certainly
have  very
strong
piece
of
evidence
to
corroborate
your
view
but
if
your
husband
is
alive
and
able
to
write
letters
why
should
he
remain
away
from
you  cannot
imagine
it
is
unthinkable
and
on
monday
he
made
no
remarks
before
leaving
you
no
and
you
were
surprised
to
see
him
in
swandam
lane
very
much
so
was
the
window
open
yes
then
he
might
have
called
to
you
he
might
he
only
as  understand
gave
an
inarticulate
cry
yes  call
for
help
you
thought
yes
he
waved
his
hands
but
it
might
have
been  cry
of
surprise
astonishment
at
the
unexpected
sight
of
you
might
cause
him
to
throw
up
his
hands
it
is
possible
and
you
thought
he
was
pulled
back
he
disappeared
so
suddenly
he
might
have
leaped
back
you
did
not
see
anyone
else
in
the
room
no
but
this
horrible
man
confessed
to
having
been
there
and
the
lascar
was
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
quite
so
your
husband
as
far
as
you
could
see
had
his
ordinary
clothes
on
but
without
his
collar
or
tie  distinctly
saw
his
bare
throat
had
he
ever
spoken
of
swandam
lane
never
had
he
ever
showed
any
signs
of
having
taken
opium
never
thank
you
mrs
st
clair
those
are
the
principal
points
about
which  wished
to
be
absolutely
clear
we
shall
now
have  little
supper
and
then
retire
for
we
may
have  very
busy
day
to
morrow  large
and
comfortable
double
bedded
room
had
been
placed
at
our
disposal
and  was
quickly
between
the
sheets
for  was
weary
after
my
night
of
adventure
sherlock
holmes
was  man
however
who
when
he
had
an
unsolved
problem
upon
his
mind
would
go
for
days
and
even
for  week
without
rest
turning
it
over
rearranging
his
facts
looking
at
it
from
every
point
of
view
until
he
had
either
fathomed
it
or
convinced
himself
that
his
data
were
insufficient
it
was
soon
evident
to
me
that
he
was
now
preparing
for
an
all
night
sitting
he
took
off
his
coat
and
waistcoat
put
on  large
blue
dressing
gown
and
then
wandered
about
the
room
collecting
pillows
from
his
bed
and
cushions
from
the
sofa
and
armchairs
with
these
he
constructed  sort
of
eastern
divan
upon
which
he
perched
himself
cross
legged
with
an
ounce
of
shag
tobacco
and  box
of
matches
laid
out
in
front
of
him
in
the
dim
light
of
the
lamp  saw
him
sitting
there
an
old
briar
pipe
between
his
lips
his
eyes
fixed
vacantly
upon
the
corner
of
the
ceiling
the
blue
smoke
curling
up
from
him
silent
motionless
with
the
light
shining
upon
his
strong
set
aquiline
features
so
he
sat
as  dropped
off
to
sleep
and
so
he
sat
when  sudden
ejaculation
caused
me
to
wake
up
and  found
the
summer
sun
shining
into
the
apartment
the
pipe
was
still
between
his
lips
the
smoke
still
curled
upward
and
the
room
was
full
of  dense
tobacco
haze
but
nothing
remained
of
the
heap
of
shag
which  had
seen
upon
the
previous
night
awake
watson
he
asked
yes
game
for  morning
drive
certainly
then
dress
no
one
is
stirring
yet
but  know
where
the
stable
boy
sleeps
and
we
shall
soon
have
the
trap
out
he
chuckled
to
himself
as
he
spoke
his
eyes
twinkled
and
he
seemed  different
man
to
the
sombre
thinker
of
the
previous
night
as  dressed  glanced
at
my
watch
it
was
no
wonder
that
no
one
was
stirring
it
was
twenty
five
minutes
past
four  had
hardly
finished
when
holmes
returned
with
the
news
that
the
boy
was
putting
in
the
horse  want
to
test  little
theory
of
mine
said
he
pulling
on
his
boots  think
watson
that
you
are
now
standing
in
the
presence
of
one
of
the
most
absolute
fools
in
europe  deserve
to
be
kicked
from
here
to
charing
cross
but  think  have
the
key
of
the
affair
now
and
where
is
it  asked
smiling
in
the
bathroom
he
answered
oh
yes  am
not
joking
he
continued
seeing
my
look
of
incredulity  have
just
been
there
and  have
taken
it
out
and  have
got
it
in
this
gladstone
bag
come
on
my
boy
and
we
shall
see
whether
it
will
not
fit
the
lock
we
made
our
way
downstairs
as
quietly
as
possible
and
out
into
the
bright
morning
sunshine
in
the
road
stood
our
horse
and
trap
with
the
half
clad
stable
boy
waiting
at
the
head
we
both
sprang
in
and
away
we
dashed
down
the
london
road  few
country
carts
were
stirring
bearing
in
vegetables
to
the
metropolis
but
the
lines
of
villas
on
either
side
were
as
silent
and
lifeless
as
some
city
in  dream
it
has
been
in
some
points  singular
case
said
holmes
flicking
the
horse
on
into  gallop  confess
that  have
been
as
blind
as  mole
but
it
is
better
to
learn
wisdom
late
than
never
to
learn
it
at
all
in
town
the
earliest
risers
were
just
beginning
to
look
sleepily
from
their
windows
as
we
drove
through
the
streets
of
the
surrey
side
passing
down
the
waterloo
bridge
road
we
crossed
over
the
river
and
dashing
up
wellington
street
wheeled
sharply
to
the
right
and
found
ourselves
in
bow
street
sherlock
holmes
was
well
known
to
the
force
and
the
two
constables
at
the
door
saluted
him
one
of
them
held
the
horse  head
while
the
other
led
us
in
who
is
on
duty
asked
holmes
inspector
bradstreet
sir

stout
official
had
come
down
the
stone
flagged
passage
in  peaked
cap
and
frogged
jacket  wish
to
have  quiet
word
with
you
bradstreet
certainly
mr
holmes
step
into
my
room
here
it
was  small
office
like
room
with  huge
ledger
upon
the
table
and  telephone
projecting
from
the
wall
the
inspector
sat
down
at
his
desk
what
can  do
for
you
mr
holmes  called
about
that
beggarman
boone
the
one
who
was
charged
with
being
concerned
in
the
disappearance
of
mr
neville
st
clair
of
lee
yes
he
was
brought
up
and
remanded
for
further
inquiries
so  heard

have
him
here
in
the
cells
is
he
quiet
oh
he
gives
no
trouble
but
he
is  dirty
scoundrel
dirty
yes
it
is
all
we
can
do
to
make
him
wash
his
hands
and
his
face
is
as
black
as  tinker  well
when
once
his
case
has
been
settled
he
will
have  regular
prison
bath
and  think
if
you
saw
him
you
would
agree
with
me
that
he
needed
it  should
like
to
see
him
very
much
would
you
that
is
easily
done
come
this
way
you

leave
your
bag
no  think
that  ll
take
it
very
good
come
this
way
if
you
please
he
led
us
down  passage
opened  barred
door
passed
down  winding
stair
and
brought
us
to  whitewashed
corridor
with  line
of
doors
on
each
side
the
third
on
the
right
is
his
said
the
inspector
here
it
is
he
quietly
shot
back  panel
in
the
upper
part
of
the
door
and
glanced
through
he
is
asleep
said
he
you
can
see
him
very
well
we
both
put
our
eyes
to
the
grating
the
prisoner
lay
with
his
face
towards
us
in  very
deep
sleep
breathing
slowly
and
heavily
he
was  middle
sized
man
coarsely
clad
as
became
his
calling
with  coloured
shirt
protruding
through
the
rent
in
his
tattered
coat
he
was
as
the
inspector
had
said
extremely
dirty
but
the
grime
which
covered
his
face
could
not
conceal
its
repulsive
ugliness  broad
wheal
from
an
old
scar
ran
right
across
it
from
eye
to
chin
and
by
its
contraction
had
turned
up
one
side
of
the
upper
lip
so
that
three
teeth
were
exposed
in  perpetual
snarl  shock
of
very
bright
red
hair
grew
low
over
his
eyes
and
forehead
he  a
beauty
isn  he
said
the
inspector
he
certainly
needs  wash
remarked
holmes  had
an
idea
that
he
might
and  took
the
liberty
of
bringing
the
tools
with
me
he
opened
the
gladstone
bag
as
he
spoke
and
took
out
to
my
astonishment  very
large
bath
sponge
he
he
you
are  funny
one
chuckled
the
inspector
now
if
you
will
have
the
great
goodness
to
open
that
door
very
quietly
we
will
soon
make
him
cut  much
more
respectable
figure
well  don  know
why
not
said
the
inspector
he
doesn  look  credit
to
the
bow
street
cells
does
he
he
slipped
his
key
into
the
lock
and
we
all
very
quietly
entered
the
cell
the
sleeper
half
turned
and
then
settled
down
once
more
into  deep
slumber
holmes
stooped
to
the
water
jug
moistened
his
sponge
and
then
rubbed
it
twice
vigorously
across
and
down
the
prisoner  face
let
me
introduce
you
he
shouted
to
mr
neville
st
clair
of
lee
in
the
county
of
kent
never
in
my
life
have  seen
such  sight
the
man  face
peeled
off
under
the
sponge
like
the
bark
from  tree
gone
was
the
coarse
brown
tint
gone
too
was
the
horrid
scar
which
had
seamed
it
across
and
the
twisted
lip
which
had
given
the
repulsive
sneer
to
the
face  twitch
brought
away
the
tangled
red
hair
and
there
sitting
up
in
his
bed
was  pale
sad
faced
refined
looking
man
black
haired
and
smooth
skinned
rubbing
his
eyes
and
staring
about
him
with
sleepy
bewilderment
then
suddenly
realising
the
exposure
he
broke
into  scream
and
threw
himself
down
with
his
face
to
the
pillow
great
heavens
cried
the
inspector
it
is
indeed
the
missing
man  know
him
from
the
photograph
the
prisoner
turned
with
the
reckless
air
of  man
who
abandons
himself
to
his
destiny
be
it
so
said
he
and
pray
what
am  charged
with
with
making
away
with
mr
neville
st
oh
come
you
can  be
charged
with
that
unless
they
make  case
of
attempted
suicide
of
it
said
the
inspector
with  grin
well  have
been
twenty
seven
years
in
the
force
but
this
really
takes
the
cake
if  am
mr
neville
st
clair
then
it
is
obvious
that
no
crime
has
been
committed
and
that
therefore  am
illegally
detained
no
crime
but  very
great
error
has
been
committed
said
holmes
you
would
have
done
better
to
have
trusted
you
wife
it
was
not
the
wife
it
was
the
children
groaned
the
prisoner
god
help
me  would
not
have
them
ashamed
of
their
father
my
god
what
an
exposure
what
can  do
sherlock
holmes
sat
down
beside
him
on
the
couch
and
patted
him
kindly
on
the
shoulder
if
you
leave
it
to  court
of
law
to
clear
the
matter
up
said
he
of
course
you
can
hardly
avoid
publicity
on
the
other
hand
if
you
convince
the
police
authorities
that
there
is
no
possible
case
against
you  do
not
know
that
there
is
any
reason
that
the
details
should
find
their
way
into
the
papers
inspector
bradstreet
would  am
sure
make
notes
upon
anything
which
you
might
tell
us
and
submit
it
to
the
proper
authorities
the
case
would
then
never
go
into
court
at
all
god
bless
you
cried
the
prisoner
passionately  would
have
endured
imprisonment
ay
even
execution
rather
than
have
left
my
miserable
secret
as  family
blot
to
my
children
you
are
the
first
who
have
ever
heard
my
story
my
father
was  schoolmaster
in
chesterfield
where  received
an
excellent
education  travelled
in
my
youth
took
to
the
stage
and
finally
became  reporter
on
an
evening
paper
in
london
one
day
my
editor
wished
to
have  series
of
articles
upon
begging
in
the
metropolis
and  volunteered
to
supply
them
there
was
the
point
from
which
all
my
adventures
started
it
was
only
by
trying
begging
as
an
amateur
that  could
get
the
facts
upon
which
to
base
my
articles
when
an
actor  had
of
course
learned
all
the
secrets
of
making
up
and
had
been
famous
in
the
green
room
for
my
skill  took
advantage
now
of
my
attainments  painted
my
face
and
to
make
myself
as
pitiable
as
possible  made  good
scar
and
fixed
one
side
of
my
lip
in  twist
by
the
aid
of  small
slip
of
flesh
coloured
plaster
then
with  red
head
of
hair
and
an
appropriate
dress  took
my
station
in
the
business
part
of
the
city
ostensibly
as  match
seller
but
really
as  beggar
for
seven
hours  plied
my
trade
and
when  returned
home
in
the
evening  found
to
my
surprise
that  had
received
no
less
than  d  wrote
my
articles
and
thought
little
more
of
the
matter
until
some
time
later  backed  bill
for  friend
and
had  writ
served
upon
me
for  was
at
my
wit  end
where
to
get
the
money
but  sudden
idea
came
to
me  begged  fortnight  grace
from
the
creditor
asked
for  holiday
from
my
employers
and
spent
the
time
in
begging
in
the
city
under
my
disguise
in
ten
days  had
the
money
and
had
paid
the
debt
well
you
can
imagine
how
hard
it
was
to
settle
down
to
arduous
work
at  week
when  knew
that  could
earn
as
much
in  day
by
smearing
my
face
with  little
paint
laying
my
cap
on
the
ground
and
sitting
still
it
was  long
fight
between
my
pride
and
the
money
but
the
dollars
won
at
last
and  threw
up
reporting
and
sat
day
after
day
in
the
corner
which  had
first
chosen
inspiring
pity
by
my
ghastly
face
and
filling
my
pockets
with
coppers
only
one
man
knew
my
secret
he
was
the
keeper
of  low
den
in
which  used
to
lodge
in
swandam
lane
where  could
every
morning
emerge
as  squalid
beggar
and
in
the
evenings
transform
myself
into  well
dressed
man
about
town
this
fellow  lascar
was
well
paid
by
me
for
his
rooms
so
that  knew
that
my
secret
was
safe
in
his
possession
well
very
soon  found
that  was
saving
considerable
sums
of
money  do
not
mean
that
any
beggar
in
the
streets
of
london
could
earn  year
which
is
less
than
my
average
takings
but  had
exceptional
advantages
in
my
power
of
making
up
and
also
in  facility
of
repartee
which
improved
by
practice
and
made
me
quite  recognised
character
in
the
city
all
day  stream
of
pennies
varied
by
silver
poured
in
upon
me
and
it
was  very
bad
day
in
which  failed
to
take
as  grew
richer  grew
more
ambitious
took  house
in
the
country
and
eventually
married
without
anyone
having  suspicion
as
to
my
real
occupation
my
dear
wife
knew
that  had
business
in
the
city
she
little
knew
what
last
monday  had
finished
for
the
day
and
was
dressing
in
my
room
above
the
opium
den
when  looked
out
of
my
window
and
saw
to
my
horror
and
astonishment
that
my
wife
was
standing
in
the
street
with
her
eyes
fixed
full
upon
me  gave  cry
of
surprise
threw
up
my
arms
to
cover
my
face
and
rushing
to
my
confidant
the
lascar
entreated
him
to
prevent
anyone
from
coming
up
to
me  heard
her
voice
downstairs
but  knew
that
she
could
not
ascend
swiftly  threw
off
my
clothes
pulled
on
those
of  beggar
and
put
on
my
pigments
and
wig
even  wife  eyes
could
not
pierce
so
complete  disguise
but
then
it
occurred
to
me
that
there
might
be  search
in
the
room
and
that
the
clothes
might
betray
me  threw
open
the
window
reopening
by
my
violence  small
cut
which  had
inflicted
upon
myself
in
the
bedroom
that
morning
then  seized
my
coat
which
was
weighted
by
the
coppers
which  had
just
transferred
to
it
from
the
leather
bag
in
which  carried
my
takings  hurled
it
out
of
the
window
and
it
disappeared
into
the
thames
the
other
clothes
would
have
followed
but
at
that
moment
there
was  rush
of
constables
up
the
stair
and  few
minutes
after  found
rather  confess
to
my
relief
that
instead
of
being
identified
as
mr
neville
st
clair  was
arrested
as
his
murderer  do
not
know
that
there
is
anything
else
for
me
to
explain  was
determined
to
preserve
my
disguise
as
long
as
possible
and
hence
my
preference
for  dirty
face
knowing
that
my
wife
would
be
terribly
anxious  slipped
off
my
ring
and
confided
it
to
the
lascar
at  moment
when
no
constable
was
watching
me
together
with  hurried
scrawl
telling
her
that
she
had
no
cause
to
fear
that
note
only
reached
her
yesterday
said
holmes
good
god
what  week
she
must
have
spent
the
police
have
watched
this
lascar
said
inspector
bradstreet
and  can
quite
understand
that
he
might
find
it
difficult
to
post  letter
unobserved
probably
he
handed
it
to
some
sailor
customer
of
his
who
forgot
all
about
it
for
some
days
that
was
it
said
holmes
nodding
approvingly  have
no
doubt
of
it
but
have
you
never
been
prosecuted
for
begging
many
times
but
what
was  fine
to
me
it
must
stop
here
however
said
bradstreet
if
the
police
are
to
hush
this
thing
up
there
must
be
no
more
of
hugh
boone  have
sworn
it
by
the
most
solemn
oaths
which  man
can
take
in
that
case  think
that
it
is
probable
that
no
further
steps
may
be
taken
but
if
you
are
found
again
then
all
must
come
out  am
sure
mr
holmes
that
we
are
very
much
indebted
to
you
for
having
cleared
the
matter
up  wish  knew
how
you
reach
your
results  reached
this
one
said
my
friend
by
sitting
upon
five
pillows
and
consuming
an
ounce
of
shag  think
watson
that
if
we
drive
to
baker
street
we
shall
just
be
in
time
for
breakfast
vii
the
adventure
of
the
blue
carbuncle  had
called
upon
my
friend
sherlock
holmes
upon
the
second
morning
after
christmas
with
the
intention
of
wishing
him
the
compliments
of
the
season
he
was
lounging
upon
the
sofa
in  purple
dressing
gown  pipe
rack
within
his
reach
upon
the
right
and  pile
of
crumpled
morning
papers
evidently
newly
studied
near
at
hand
beside
the
couch
was  wooden
chair
and
on
the
angle
of
the
back
hung  very
seedy
and
disreputable
hard
felt
hat
much
the
worse
for
wear
and
cracked
in
several
places  lens
and  forceps
lying
upon
the
seat
of
the
chair
suggested
that
the
hat
had
been
suspended
in
this
manner
for
the
purpose
of
examination
you
are
engaged
said  perhaps  interrupt
you
not
at
all  am
glad
to
have  friend
with
whom  can
discuss
my
results
the
matter
is  perfectly
trivial
one
he
jerked
his
thumb
in
the
direction
of
the
old
hat
but
there
are
points
in
connection
with
it
which
are
not
entirely
devoid
of
interest
and
even
of
instruction  seated
myself
in
his
armchair
and
warmed
my
hands
before
his
crackling
fire
for  sharp
frost
had
set
in
and
the
windows
were
thick
with
the
ice
crystals  suppose  remarked
that
homely
as
it
looks
this
thing
has
some
deadly
story
linked
on
to
it
that
it
is
the
clue
which
will
guide
you
in
the
solution
of
some
mystery
and
the
punishment
of
some
crime
no
no
no
crime
said
sherlock
holmes
laughing
only
one
of
those
whimsical
little
incidents
which
will
happen
when
you
have
four
million
human
beings
all
jostling
each
other
within
the
space
of  few
square
miles
amid
the
action
and
reaction
of
so
dense  swarm
of
humanity
every
possible
combination
of
events
may
be
expected
to
take
place
and
many  little
problem
will
be
presented
which
may
be
striking
and
bizarre
without
being
criminal
we
have
already
had
experience
of
such
so
much
so  remarked
that
of
the
last
six
cases
which  have
added
to
my
notes
three
have
been
entirely
free
of
any
legal
crime
precisely
you
allude
to
my
attempt
to
recover
the
irene
adler
papers
to
the
singular
case
of
miss
mary
sutherland
and
to
the
adventure
of
the
man
with
the
twisted
lip
well  have
no
doubt
that
this
small
matter
will
fall
into
the
same
innocent
category
you
know
peterson
the
commissionaire
yes
it
is
to
him
that
this
trophy
belongs
it
is
his
hat
no
no
he
found
it
its
owner
is
unknown  beg
that
you
will
look
upon
it
not
as  battered
billycock
but
as
an
intellectual
problem
and
first
as
to
how
it
came
here
it
arrived
upon
christmas
morning
in
company
with  good
fat
goose
which
is  have
no
doubt
roasting
at
this
moment
in
front
of
peterson  fire
the
facts
are
these
about
four  clock
on
christmas
morning
peterson
who
as
you
know
is  very
honest
fellow
was
returning
from
some
small
jollification
and
was
making
his
way
homeward
down
tottenham
court
road
in
front
of
him
he
saw
in
the
gaslight  tallish
man
walking
with  slight
stagger
and
carrying  white
goose
slung
over
his
shoulder
as
he
reached
the
corner
of
goodge
street  row
broke
out
between
this
stranger
and  little
knot
of
roughs
one
of
the
latter
knocked
off
the
man  hat
on
which
he
raised
his
stick
to
defend
himself
and
swinging
it
over
his
head
smashed
the
shop
window
behind
him
peterson
had
rushed
forward
to
protect
the
stranger
from
his
assailants
but
the
man
shocked
at
having
broken
the
window
and
seeing
an
official
looking
person
in
uniform
rushing
towards
him
dropped
his
goose
took
to
his
heels
and
vanished
amid
the
labyrinth
of
small
streets
which
lie
at
the
back
of
tottenham
court
road
the
roughs
had
also
fled
at
the
appearance
of
peterson
so
that
he
was
left
in
possession
of
the
field
of
battle
and
also
of
the
spoils
of
victory
in
the
shape
of
this
battered
hat
and  most
unimpeachable
christmas
goose
which
surely
he
restored
to
their
owner
my
dear
fellow
there
lies
the
problem
it
is
true
that
for
mrs
henry
baker
was
printed
upon  small
card
which
was
tied
to
the
bird  left
leg
and
it
is
also
true
that
the
initials  b
are
legible
upon
the
lining
of
this
hat
but
as
there
are
some
thousands
of
bakers
and
some
hundreds
of
henry
bakers
in
this
city
of
ours
it
is
not
easy
to
restore
lost
property
to
any
one
of
them
what
then
did
peterson
do
he
brought
round
both
hat
and
goose
to
me
on
christmas
morning
knowing
that
even
the
smallest
problems
are
of
interest
to
me
the
goose
we
retained
until
this
morning
when
there
were
signs
that
in
spite
of
the
slight
frost
it
would
be
well
that
it
should
be
eaten
without
unnecessary
delay
its
finder
has
carried
it
off
therefore
to
fulfil
the
ultimate
destiny
of  goose
while  continue
to
retain
the
hat
of
the
unknown
gentleman
who
lost
his
christmas
dinner
did
he
not
advertise
no
then
what
clue
could
you
have
as
to
his
identity
only
as
much
as
we
can
deduce
from
his
hat
precisely
but
you
are
joking
what
can
you
gather
from
this
old
battered
felt
here
is
my
lens
you
know
my
methods
what
can
you
gather
yourself
as
to
the
individuality
of
the
man
who
has
worn
this
article  took
the
tattered
object
in
my
hands
and
turned
it
over
rather
ruefully
it
was  very
ordinary
black
hat
of
the
usual
round
shape
hard
and
much
the
worse
for
wear
the
lining
had
been
of
red
silk
but
was  good
deal
discoloured
there
was
no
maker  name
but
as
holmes
had
remarked
the
initials  b
were
scrawled
upon
one
side
it
was
pierced
in
the
brim
for  hat
securer
but
the
elastic
was
missing
for
the
rest
it
was
cracked
exceedingly
dusty
and
spotted
in
several
places
although
there
seemed
to
have
been
some
attempt
to
hide
the
discoloured
patches
by
smearing
them
with
ink  can
see
nothing
said  handing
it
back
to
my
friend
on
the
contrary
watson
you
can
see
everything
you
fail
however
to
reason
from
what
you
see
you
are
too
timid
in
drawing
your
inferences
then
pray
tell
me
what
it
is
that
you
can
infer
from
this
hat
he
picked
it
up
and
gazed
at
it
in
the
peculiar
introspective
fashion
which
was
characteristic
of
him
it
is
perhaps
less
suggestive
than
it
might
have
been
he
remarked
and
yet
there
are  few
inferences
which
are
very
distinct
and  few
others
which
represent
at
least  strong
balance
of
probability
that
the
man
was
highly
intellectual
is
of
course
obvious
upon
the
face
of
it
and
also
that
he
was
fairly
well
to
do
within
the
last
three
years
although
he
has
now
fallen
upon
evil
days
he
had
foresight
but
has
less
now
than
formerly
pointing
to  moral
retrogression
which
when
taken
with
the
decline
of
his
fortunes
seems
to
indicate
some
evil
influence
probably
drink
at
work
upon
him
this
may
account
also
for
the
obvious
fact
that
his
wife
has
ceased
to
love
him
my
dear
holmes
he
has
however
retained
some
degree
of
self
respect
he
continued
disregarding
my
remonstrance
he
is  man
who
leads  sedentary
life
goes
out
little
is
out
of
training
entirely
is
middle
aged
has
grizzled
hair
which
he
has
had
cut
within
the
last
few
days
and
which
he
anoints
with
lime
cream
these
are
the
more
patent
facts
which
are
to
be
deduced
from
his
hat
also
by
the
way
that
it
is
extremely
improbable
that
he
has
gas
laid
on
in
his
house
you
are
certainly
joking
holmes
not
in
the
least
is
it
possible
that
even
now
when  give
you
these
results
you
are
unable
to
see
how
they
are
attained  have
no
doubt
that  am
very
stupid
but  must
confess
that  am
unable
to
follow
you
for
example
how
did
you
deduce
that
this
man
was
intellectual
for
answer
holmes
clapped
the
hat
upon
his
head
it
came
right
over
the
forehead
and
settled
upon
the
bridge
of
his
nose
it
is  question
of
cubic
capacity
said
he  man
with
so
large  brain
must
have
something
in
it
the
decline
of
his
fortunes
then
this
hat
is
three
years
old
these
flat
brims
curled
at
the
edge
came
in
then
it
is  hat
of
the
very
best
quality
look
at
the
band
of
ribbed
silk
and
the
excellent
lining
if
this
man
could
afford
to
buy
so
expensive  hat
three
years
ago
and
has
had
no
hat
since
then
he
has
assuredly
gone
down
in
the
world
well
that
is
clear
enough
certainly
but
how
about
the
foresight
and
the
moral
retrogression
sherlock
holmes
laughed
here
is
the
foresight
said
he
putting
his
finger
upon
the
little
disc
and
loop
of
the
hat
securer
they
are
never
sold
upon
hats
if
this
man
ordered
one
it
is  sign
of  certain
amount
of
foresight
since
he
went
out
of
his
way
to
take
this
precaution
against
the
wind
but
since
we
see
that
he
has
broken
the
elastic
and
has
not
troubled
to
replace
it
it
is
obvious
that
he
has
less
foresight
now
than
formerly
which
is  distinct
proof
of  weakening
nature
on
the
other
hand
he
has
endeavoured
to
conceal
some
of
these
stains
upon
the
felt
by
daubing
them
with
ink
which
is  sign
that
he
has
not
entirely
lost
his
self
respect
your
reasoning
is
certainly
plausible
the
further
points
that
he
is
middle
aged
that
his
hair
is
grizzled
that
it
has
been
recently
cut
and
that
he
uses
lime
cream
are
all
to
be
gathered
from  close
examination
of
the
lower
part
of
the
lining
the
lens
discloses  large
number
of
hair
ends
clean
cut
by
the
scissors
of
the
barber
they
all
appear
to
be
adhesive
and
there
is  distinct
odour
of
lime
cream
this
dust
you
will
observe
is
not
the
gritty
grey
dust
of
the
street
but
the
fluffy
brown
dust
of
the
house
showing
that
it
has
been
hung
up
indoors
most
of
the
time
while
the
marks
of
moisture
upon
the
inside
are
proof
positive
that
the
wearer
perspired
very
freely
and
could
therefore
hardly
be
in
the
best
of
training
but
his
wife
you
said
that
she
had
ceased
to
love
him
this
hat
has
not
been
brushed
for
weeks
when  see
you
my
dear
watson
with  week  accumulation
of
dust
upon
your
hat
and
when
your
wife
allows
you
to
go
out
in
such  state  shall
fear
that
you
also
have
been
unfortunate
enough
to
lose
your
wife  affection
but
he
might
be  bachelor
nay
he
was
bringing
home
the
goose
as  peace
offering
to
his
wife
remember
the
card
upon
the
bird  leg
you
have
an
answer
to
everything
but
how
on
earth
do
you
deduce
that
the
gas
is
not
laid
on
in
his
house
one
tallow
stain
or
even
two
might
come
by
chance
but
when  see
no
less
than
five  think
that
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
the
individual
must
be
brought
into
frequent
contact
with
burning
tallow
walks
upstairs
at
night
probably
with
his
hat
in
one
hand
and  guttering
candle
in
the
other
anyhow
he
never
got
tallow
stains
from  gas
jet
are
you
satisfied
well
it
is
very
ingenious
said  laughing
but
since
as
you
said
just
now
there
has
been
no
crime
committed
and
no
harm
done
save
the
loss
of  goose
all
this
seems
to
be
rather  waste
of
energy
sherlock
holmes
had
opened
his
mouth
to
reply
when
the
door
flew
open
and
peterson
the
commissionaire
rushed
into
the
apartment
with
flushed
cheeks
and
the
face
of  man
who
is
dazed
with
astonishment
the
goose
mr
holmes
the
goose
sir
he
gasped
eh
what
of
it
then
has
it
returned
to
life
and
flapped
off
through
the
kitchen
window
holmes
twisted
himself
round
upon
the
sofa
to
get  fairer
view
of
the
man  excited
face
see
here
sir
see
what
my
wife
found
in
its
crop
he
held
out
his
hand
and
displayed
upon
the
centre
of
the
palm  brilliantly
scintillating
blue
stone
rather
smaller
than  bean
in
size
but
of
such
purity
and
radiance
that
it
twinkled
like
an
electric
point
in
the
dark
hollow
of
his
hand
sherlock
holmes
sat
up
with  whistle
by
jove
peterson
said
he
this
is
treasure
trove
indeed  suppose
you
know
what
you
have
got  diamond
sir  precious
stone
it
cuts
into
glass
as
though
it
were
putty
it  more
than  precious
stone
it
is
the
precious
stone
not
the
countess
of
morcar  blue
carbuncle  ejaculated
precisely
so  ought
to
know
its
size
and
shape
seeing
that  have
read
the
advertisement
about
it
in
the
times
every
day
lately
it
is
absolutely
unique
and
its
value
can
only
be
conjectured
but
the
reward
offered
of
is
certainly
not
within  twentieth
part
of
the
market
price  thousand
pounds
great
lord
of
mercy
the
commissionaire
plumped
down
into  chair
and
stared
from
one
to
the
other
of
us
that
is
the
reward
and  have
reason
to
know
that
there
are
sentimental
considerations
in
the
background
which
would
induce
the
countess
to
part
with
half
her
fortune
if
she
could
but
recover
the
gem
it
was
lost
if  remember
aright
at
the
hotel
cosmopolitan  remarked
precisely
so
on
december
nd
just
five
days
ago
john
horner  plumber
was
accused
of
having
abstracted
it
from
the
lady  jewel
case
the
evidence
against
him
was
so
strong
that
the
case
has
been
referred
to
the
assizes  have
some
account
of
the
matter
here  believe
he
rummaged
amid
his
newspapers
glancing
over
the
dates
until
at
last
he
smoothed
one
out
doubled
it
over
and
read
the
following
paragraph
hotel
cosmopolitan
jewel
robbery
john
horner
plumber
was
brought
up
upon
the
charge
of
having
upon
the
nd
inst
abstracted
from
the
jewel
case
of
the
countess
of
morcar
the
valuable
gem
known
as
the
blue
carbuncle
james
ryder
upper
attendant
at
the
hotel
gave
his
evidence
to
the
effect
that
he
had
shown
horner
up
to
the
dressing
room
of
the
countess
of
morcar
upon
the
day
of
the
robbery
in
order
that
he
might
solder
the
second
bar
of
the
grate
which
was
loose
he
had
remained
with
horner
some
little
time
but
had
finally
been
called
away
on
returning
he
found
that
horner
had
disappeared
that
the
bureau
had
been
forced
open
and
that
the
small
morocco
casket
in
which
as
it
afterwards
transpired
the
countess
was
accustomed
to
keep
her
jewel
was
lying
empty
upon
the
dressing
table
ryder
instantly
gave
the
alarm
and
horner
was
arrested
the
same
evening
but
the
stone
could
not
be
found
either
upon
his
person
or
in
his
rooms
catherine
cusack
maid
to
the
countess
deposed
to
having
heard
ryder  cry
of
dismay
on
discovering
the
robbery
and
to
having
rushed
into
the
room
where
she
found
matters
as
described
by
the
last
witness
inspector
bradstreet  division
gave
evidence
as
to
the
arrest
of
horner
who
struggled
frantically
and
protested
his
innocence
in
the
strongest
terms
evidence
of  previous
conviction
for
robbery
having
been
given
against
the
prisoner
the
magistrate
refused
to
deal
summarily
with
the
offence
but
referred
it
to
the
assizes
horner
who
had
shown
signs
of
intense
emotion
during
the
proceedings
fainted
away
at
the
conclusion
and
was
carried
out
of
court
hum
so
much
for
the
police
court
said
holmes
thoughtfully
tossing
aside
the
paper
the
question
for
us
now
to
solve
is
the
sequence
of
events
leading
from  rifled
jewel
case
at
one
end
to
the
crop
of  goose
in
tottenham
court
road
at
the
other
you
see
watson
our
little
deductions
have
suddenly
assumed  much
more
important
and
less
innocent
aspect
here
is
the
stone
the
stone
came
from
the
goose
and
the
goose
came
from
mr
henry
baker
the
gentleman
with
the
bad
hat
and
all
the
other
characteristics
with
which  have
bored
you
so
now
we
must
set
ourselves
very
seriously
to
finding
this
gentleman
and
ascertaining
what
part
he
has
played
in
this
little
mystery
to
do
this
we
must
try
the
simplest
means
first
and
these
lie
undoubtedly
in
an
advertisement
in
all
the
evening
papers
if
this
fail  shall
have
recourse
to
other
methods
what
will
you
say
give
me  pencil
and
that
slip
of
paper
now
then
found
at
the
corner
of
goodge
street  goose
and  black
felt
hat
mr
henry
baker
can
have
the
same
by
applying
at
this
evening
at  baker
street
that
is
clear
and
concise
very
but
will
he
see
it
well
he
is
sure
to
keep
an
eye
on
the
papers
since
to  poor
man
the
loss
was  heavy
one
he
was
clearly
so
scared
by
his
mischance
in
breaking
the
window
and
by
the
approach
of
peterson
that
he
thought
of
nothing
but
flight
but
since
then
he
must
have
bitterly
regretted
the
impulse
which
caused
him
to
drop
his
bird
then
again
the
introduction
of
his
name
will
cause
him
to
see
it
for
everyone
who
knows
him
will
direct
his
attention
to
it
here
you
are
peterson
run
down
to
the
advertising
agency
and
have
this
put
in
the
evening
papers
in
which
sir
oh
in
the
globe
star
pall
mall
st
james  evening
news
standard
echo
and
any
others
that
occur
to
you
very
well
sir
and
this
stone
ah
yes  shall
keep
the
stone
thank
you
and  say
peterson
just
buy  goose
on
your
way
back
and
leave
it
here
with
me
for
we
must
have
one
to
give
to
this
gentleman
in
place
of
the
one
which
your
family
is
now
devouring
when
the
commissionaire
had
gone
holmes
took
up
the
stone
and
held
it
against
the
light
it  a
bonny
thing
said
he
just
see
how
it
glints
and
sparkles
of
course
it
is  nucleus
and
focus
of
crime
every
good
stone
is
they
are
the
devil  pet
baits
in
the
larger
and
older
jewels
every
facet
may
stand
for  bloody
deed
this
stone
is
not
yet
twenty
years
old
it
was
found
in
the
banks
of
the
amoy
river
in
southern
china
and
is
remarkable
in
having
every
characteristic
of
the
carbuncle
save
that
it
is
blue
in
shade
instead
of
ruby
red
in
spite
of
its
youth
it
has
already  sinister
history
there
have
been
two
murders  vitriol
throwing  suicide
and
several
robberies
brought
about
for
the
sake
of
this
forty
grain
weight
of
crystallised
charcoal
who
would
think
that
so
pretty  toy
would
be  purveyor
to
the
gallows
and
the
prison  ll
lock
it
up
in
my
strong
box
now
and
drop  line
to
the
countess
to
say
that
we
have
it
do
you
think
that
this
man
horner
is
innocent  cannot
tell
well
then
do
you
imagine
that
this
other
one
henry
baker
had
anything
to
do
with
the
matter
it
is  think
much
more
likely
that
henry
baker
is
an
absolutely
innocent
man
who
had
no
idea
that
the
bird
which
he
was
carrying
was
of
considerably
more
value
than
if
it
were
made
of
solid
gold
that
however  shall
determine
by  very
simple
test
if
we
have
an
answer
to
our
advertisement
and
you
can
do
nothing
until
then
nothing
in
that
case  shall
continue
my
professional
round
but  shall
come
back
in
the
evening
at
the
hour
you
have
mentioned
for  should
like
to
see
the
solution
of
so
tangled  business
very
glad
to
see
you  dine
at
seven
there
is  woodcock  believe
by
the
way
in
view
of
recent
occurrences
perhaps  ought
to
ask
mrs
hudson
to
examine
its
crop  had
been
delayed
at  case
and
it
was  little
after
half
past
six
when  found
myself
in
baker
street
once
more
as  approached
the
house  saw  tall
man
in  scotch
bonnet
with  coat
which
was
buttoned
up
to
his
chin
waiting
outside
in
the
bright
semicircle
which
was
thrown
from
the
fanlight
just
as  arrived
the
door
was
opened
and
we
were
shown
up
together
to
holmes
room
mr
henry
baker  believe
said
he
rising
from
his
armchair
and
greeting
his
visitor
with
the
easy
air
of
geniality
which
he
could
so
readily
assume
pray
take
this
chair
by
the
fire
mr
baker
it
is  cold
night
and  observe
that
your
circulation
is
more
adapted
for
summer
than
for
winter
ah
watson
you
have
just
come
at
the
right
time
is
that
your
hat
mr
baker
yes
sir
that
is
undoubtedly
my
hat
he
was  large
man
with
rounded
shoulders  massive
head
and  broad
intelligent
face
sloping
down
to  pointed
beard
of
grizzled
brown  touch
of
red
in
nose
and
cheeks
with  slight
tremor
of
his
extended
hand
recalled
holmes
surmise
as
to
his
habits
his
rusty
black
frock
coat
was
buttoned
right
up
in
front
with
the
collar
turned
up
and
his
lank
wrists
protruded
from
his
sleeves
without  sign
of
cuff
or
shirt
he
spoke
in  slow
staccato
fashion
choosing
his
words
with
care
and
gave
the
impression
generally
of  man
of
learning
and
letters
who
had
had
ill
usage
at
the
hands
of
fortune
we
have
retained
these
things
for
some
days
said
holmes
because
we
expected
to
see
an
advertisement
from
you
giving
your
address  am
at  loss
to
know
now
why
you
did
not
advertise
our
visitor
gave  rather
shamefaced
laugh
shillings
have
not
been
so
plentiful
with
me
as
they
once
were
he
remarked  had
no
doubt
that
the
gang
of
roughs
who
assaulted
me
had
carried
off
both
my
hat
and
the
bird  did
not
care
to
spend
more
money
in  hopeless
attempt
at
recovering
them
very
naturally
by
the
way
about
the
bird
we
were
compelled
to
eat
it
to
eat
it
our
visitor
half
rose
from
his
chair
in
his
excitement
yes
it
would
have
been
of
no
use
to
anyone
had
we
not
done
so
but  presume
that
this
other
goose
upon
the
sideboard
which
is
about
the
same
weight
and
perfectly
fresh
will
answer
your
purpose
equally
well
oh
certainly
certainly
answered
mr
baker
with  sigh
of
relief
of
course
we
still
have
the
feathers
legs
crop
and
so
on
of
your
own
bird
so
if
you
wish
the
man
burst
into  hearty
laugh
they
might
be
useful
to
me
as
relics
of
my
adventure
said
he
but
beyond
that  can
hardly
see
what
use
the
disjecta
membra
of
my
late
acquaintance
are
going
to
be
to
me
no
sir  think
that
with
your
permission  will
confine
my
attentions
to
the
excellent
bird
which  perceive
upon
the
sideboard
sherlock
holmes
glanced
sharply
across
at
me
with  slight
shrug
of
his
shoulders
there
is
your
hat
then
and
there
your
bird
said
he
by
the
way
would
it
bore
you
to
tell
me
where
you
got
the
other
one
from  am
somewhat
of  fowl
fancier
and  have
seldom
seen  better
grown
goose
certainly
sir
said
baker
who
had
risen
and
tucked
his
newly
gained
property
under
his
arm
there
are  few
of
us
who
frequent
the
alpha
inn
near
the
museum
we
are
to
be
found
in
the
museum
itself
during
the
day
you
understand
this
year
our
good
host
windigate
by
name
instituted  goose
club
by
which
on
consideration
of
some
few
pence
every
week
we
were
each
to
receive  bird
at
christmas
my
pence
were
duly
paid
and
the
rest
is
familiar
to
you  am
much
indebted
to
you
sir
for  scotch
bonnet
is
fitted
neither
to
my
years
nor
my
gravity
with  comical
pomposity
of
manner
he
bowed
solemnly
to
both
of
us
and
strode
off
upon
his
way
so
much
for
mr
henry
baker
said
holmes
when
he
had
closed
the
door
behind
him
it
is
quite
certain
that
he
knows
nothing
whatever
about
the
matter
are
you
hungry
watson
not
particularly
then  suggest
that
we
turn
our
dinner
into  supper
and
follow
up
this
clue
while
it
is
still
hot
by
all
means
it
was  bitter
night
so
we
drew
on
our
ulsters
and
wrapped
cravats
about
our
throats
outside
the
stars
were
shining
coldly
in  cloudless
sky
and
the
breath
of
the
passers
by
blew
out
into
smoke
like
so
many
pistol
shots
our
footfalls
rang
out
crisply
and
loudly
as
we
swung
through
the
doctors
quarter
wimpole
street
harley
street
and
so
through
wigmore
street
into
oxford
street
in  quarter
of
an
hour
we
were
in
bloomsbury
at
the
alpha
inn
which
is  small
public
house
at
the
corner
of
one
of
the
streets
which
runs
down
into
holborn
holmes
pushed
open
the
door
of
the
private
bar
and
ordered
two
glasses
of
beer
from
the
ruddy
faced
white
aproned
landlord
your
beer
should
be
excellent
if
it
is
as
good
as
your
geese
said
he
my
geese
the
man
seemed
surprised
yes  was
speaking
only
half
an
hour
ago
to
mr
henry
baker
who
was  member
of
your
goose
club
ah
yes  see
but
you
see
sir
them  not
our
geese
indeed
whose
then
well  got
the
two
dozen
from  salesman
in
covent
garden
indeed  know
some
of
them
which
was
it
breckinridge
is
his
name
ah  don  know
him
well
here  your
good
health
landlord
and
prosperity
to
your
house
good
night
now
for
mr
breckinridge
he
continued
buttoning
up
his
coat
as
we
came
out
into
the
frosty
air
remember
watson
that
though
we
have
so
homely  thing
as  goose
at
one
end
of
this
chain
we
have
at
the
other  man
who
will
certainly
get
seven
years
penal
servitude
unless
we
can
establish
his
innocence
it
is
possible
that
our
inquiry
may
but
confirm
his
guilt
but
in
any
case
we
have  line
of
investigation
which
has
been
missed
by
the
police
and
which  singular
chance
has
placed
in
our
hands
let
us
follow
it
out
to
the
bitter
end
faces
to
the
south
then
and
quick
march
we
passed
across
holborn
down
endell
street
and
so
through  zigzag
of
slums
to
covent
garden
market
one
of
the
largest
stalls
bore
the
name
of
breckinridge
upon
it
and
the
proprietor  horsey
looking
man
with  sharp
face
and
trim
side
whiskers
was
helping  boy
to
put
up
the
shutters
good
evening
it  a
cold
night
said
holmes
the
salesman
nodded
and
shot  questioning
glance
at
my
companion
sold
out
of
geese  see
continued
holmes
pointing
at
the
bare
slabs
of
marble
let
you
have
five
hundred
to
morrow
morning
that  no
good
well
there
are
some
on
the
stall
with
the
gas
flare
ah
but  was
recommended
to
you
who
by
the
landlord
of
the
alpha
oh
yes  sent
him  couple
of
dozen
fine
birds
they
were
too
now
where
did
you
get
them
from
to
my
surprise
the
question
provoked  burst
of
anger
from
the
salesman
now
then
mister
said
he
with
his
head
cocked
and
his
arms
akimbo
what
are
you
driving
at
let  have
it
straight
now
it
is
straight
enough  should
like
to
know
who
sold
you
the
geese
which
you
supplied
to
the
alpha
well
then  shan  tell
you
so
now
oh
it
is  matter
of
no
importance
but  don  know
why
you
should
be
so
warm
over
such  trifle
warm
you  be
as
warm
maybe
if
you
were
as
pestered
as  am
when  pay
good
money
for  good
article
there
should
be
an
end
of
the
business
but
it  where
are
the
geese
and
who
did
you
sell
the
geese
to
and
what
will
you
take
for
the
geese
one
would
think
they
were
the
only
geese
in
the
world
to
hear
the
fuss
that
is
made
over
them
well  have
no
connection
with
any
other
people
who
have
been
making
inquiries
said
holmes
carelessly
if
you
won  tell
us
the
bet
is
off
that
is
all
but  m
always
ready
to
back
my
opinion
on  matter
of
fowls
and  have  fiver
on
it
that
the
bird  ate
is
country
bred
well
then
you
ve
lost
your
fiver
for
it  town
bred
snapped
the
salesman
it  nothing
of
the
kind  say
it
is  don  believe
it  you
think
you
know
more
about
fowls
than  who
have
handled
them
ever
since  was  nipper  tell
you
all
those
birds
that
went
to
the
alpha
were
town
bred
you
ll
never
persuade
me
to
believe
that
will
you
bet
then
it  merely
taking
your
money
for  know
that  am
right
but  ll
have  sovereign
on
with
you
just
to
teach
you
not
to
be
obstinate
the
salesman
chuckled
grimly
bring
me
the
books
bill
said
he
the
small
boy
brought
round  small
thin
volume
and  great
greasy
backed
one
laying
them
out
together
beneath
the
hanging
lamp
now
then
mr
cocksure
said
the
salesman  thought
that  was
out
of
geese
but
before  finish
you
ll
find
that
there
is
still
one
left
in
my
shop
you
see
this
little
book
well
that  the
list
of
the
folk
from
whom  buy  you
see
well
then
here
on
this
page
are
the
country
folk
and
the
numbers
after
their
names
are
where
their
accounts
are
in
the
big
ledger
now
then
you
see
this
other
page
in
red
ink
well
that
is  list
of
my
town
suppliers
now
look
at
that
third
name
just
read
it
out
to
me
mrs
oakshott
brixton
road
read
holmes
quite
so
now
turn
that
up
in
the
ledger
holmes
turned
to
the
page
indicated
here
you
are
mrs
oakshott
brixton
road
egg
and
poultry
supplier
now
then
what  the
last
entry
december
nd
twenty
four
geese
at  d
quite
so
there
you
are
and
underneath
sold
to
mr
windigate
of
the
alpha
at  what
have
you
to
say
now
sherlock
holmes
looked
deeply
chagrined
he
drew  sovereign
from
his
pocket
and
threw
it
down
upon
the
slab
turning
away
with
the
air
of  man
whose
disgust
is
too
deep
for
words  few
yards
off
he
stopped
under  lamp
post
and
laughed
in
the
hearty
noiseless
fashion
which
was
peculiar
to
him
when
you
see  man
with
whiskers
of
that
cut
and
the
pink
un
protruding
out
of
his
pocket
you
can
always
draw
him
by  bet
said
he  daresay
that
if  had
put
down
in
front
of
him
that
man
would
not
have
given
me
such
complete
information
as
was
drawn
from
him
by
the
idea
that
he
was
doing
me
on  wager
well
watson
we
are  fancy
nearing
the
end
of
our
quest
and
the
only
point
which
remains
to
be
determined
is
whether
we
should
go
on
to
this
mrs
oakshott
to
night
or
whether
we
should
reserve
it
for
to
morrow
it
is
clear
from
what
that
surly
fellow
said
that
there
are
others
besides
ourselves
who
are
anxious
about
the
matter
and  should
his
remarks
were
suddenly
cut
short
by  loud
hubbub
which
broke
out
from
the
stall
which
we
had
just
left
turning
round
we
saw  little
rat
faced
fellow
standing
in
the
centre
of
the
circle
of
yellow
light
which
was
thrown
by
the
swinging
lamp
while
breckinridge
the
salesman
framed
in
the
door
of
his
stall
was
shaking
his
fists
fiercely
at
the
cringing
figure  ve
had
enough
of
you
and
your
geese
he
shouted  wish
you
were
all
at
the
devil
together
if
you
come
pestering
me
any
more
with
your
silly
talk  ll
set
the
dog
at
you
you
bring
mrs
oakshott
here
and  ll
answer
her
but
what
have
you
to
do
with
it
did  buy
the
geese
off
you
no
but
one
of
them
was
mine
all
the
same
whined
the
little
man
well
then
ask
mrs
oakshott
for
it
she
told
me
to
ask
you
well
you
can
ask
the
king
of
proosia
for
all  care  ve
had
enough
of
it
get
out
of
this
he
rushed
fiercely
forward
and
the
inquirer
flitted
away
into
the
darkness
ha
this
may
save
us  visit
to
brixton
road
whispered
holmes
come
with
me
and
we
will
see
what
is
to
be
made
of
this
fellow
striding
through
the
scattered
knots
of
people
who
lounged
round
the
flaring
stalls
my
companion
speedily
overtook
the
little
man
and
touched
him
upon
the
shoulder
he
sprang
round
and  could
see
in
the
gas
light
that
every
vestige
of
colour
had
been
driven
from
his
face
who
are
you
then
what
do
you
want
he
asked
in  quavering
voice
you
will
excuse
me
said
holmes
blandly
but  could
not
help
overhearing
the
questions
which
you
put
to
the
salesman
just
now  think
that  could
be
of
assistance
to
you
you
who
are
you
how
could
you
know
anything
of
the
matter
my
name
is
sherlock
holmes
it
is
my
business
to
know
what
other
people
don  know
but
you
can
know
nothing
of
this
excuse
me  know
everything
of
it
you
are
endeavouring
to
trace
some
geese
which
were
sold
by
mrs
oakshott
of
brixton
road
to  salesman
named
breckinridge
by
him
in
turn
to
mr
windigate
of
the
alpha
and
by
him
to
his
club
of
which
mr
henry
baker
is  member
oh
sir
you
are
the
very
man
whom  have
longed
to
meet
cried
the
little
fellow
with
outstretched
hands
and
quivering
fingers  can
hardly
explain
to
you
how
interested  am
in
this
matter
sherlock
holmes
hailed  four
wheeler
which
was
passing
in
that
case
we
had
better
discuss
it
in  cosy
room
rather
than
in
this
wind
swept
market
place
said
he
but
pray
tell
me
before
we
go
farther
who
it
is
that  have
the
pleasure
of
assisting
the
man
hesitated
for
an
instant
my
name
is
john
robinson
he
answered
with  sidelong
glance
no
no
the
real
name
said
holmes
sweetly
it
is
always
awkward
doing
business
with
an
alias  flush
sprang
to
the
white
cheeks
of
the
stranger
well
then
said
he
my
real
name
is
james
ryder
precisely
so
head
attendant
at
the
hotel
cosmopolitan
pray
step
into
the
cab
and  shall
soon
be
able
to
tell
you
everything
which
you
would
wish
to
know
the
little
man
stood
glancing
from
one
to
the
other
of
us
with
half
frightened
half
hopeful
eyes
as
one
who
is
not
sure
whether
he
is
on
the
verge
of  windfall
or
of  catastrophe
then
he
stepped
into
the
cab
and
in
half
an
hour
we
were
back
in
the
sitting
room
at
baker
street
nothing
had
been
said
during
our
drive
but
the
high
thin
breathing
of
our
new
companion
and
the
claspings
and
unclaspings
of
his
hands
spoke
of
the
nervous
tension
within
him
here
we
are
said
holmes
cheerily
as
we
filed
into
the
room
the
fire
looks
very
seasonable
in
this
weather
you
look
cold
mr
ryder
pray
take
the
basket
chair  will
just
put
on
my
slippers
before
we
settle
this
little
matter
of
yours
now
then
you
want
to
know
what
became
of
those
geese
yes
sir
or
rather  fancy
of
that
goose
it
was
one
bird  imagine
in
which
you
were
interested
white
with  black
bar
across
the
tail
ryder
quivered
with
emotion
oh
sir
he
cried
can
you
tell
me
where
it
went
to
it
came
here
here
yes
and  most
remarkable
bird
it
proved  don  wonder
that
you
should
take
an
interest
in
it
it
laid
an
egg
after
it
was
dead
the
bonniest
brightest
little
blue
egg
that
ever
was
seen  have
it
here
in
my
museum
our
visitor
staggered
to
his
feet
and
clutched
the
mantelpiece
with
his
right
hand
holmes
unlocked
his
strong
box
and
held
up
the
blue
carbuncle
which
shone
out
like  star
with  cold
brilliant
many
pointed
radiance
ryder
stood
glaring
with  drawn
face
uncertain
whether
to
claim
or
to
disown
it
the
game  up
ryder
said
holmes
quietly
hold
up
man
or
you
ll
be
into
the
fire
give
him
an
arm
back
into
his
chair
watson
he  not
got
blood
enough
to
go
in
for
felony
with
impunity
give
him  dash
of
brandy
so
now
he
looks  little
more
human
what  shrimp
it
is
to
be
sure
for  moment
he
had
staggered
and
nearly
fallen
but
the
brandy
brought  tinge
of
colour
into
his
cheeks
and
he
sat
staring
with
frightened
eyes
at
his
accuser  have
almost
every
link
in
my
hands
and
all
the
proofs
which  could
possibly
need
so
there
is
little
which
you
need
tell
me
still
that
little
may
as
well
be
cleared
up
to
make
the
case
complete
you
had
heard
ryder
of
this
blue
stone
of
the
countess
of
morcar  it
was
catherine
cusack
who
told
me
of
it
said
he
in  crackling
voice  see
her
ladyship  waiting
maid
well
the
temptation
of
sudden
wealth
so
easily
acquired
was
too
much
for
you
as
it
has
been
for
better
men
before
you
but
you
were
not
very
scrupulous
in
the
means
you
used
it
seems
to
me
ryder
that
there
is
the
making
of  very
pretty
villain
in
you
you
knew
that
this
man
horner
the
plumber
had
been
concerned
in
some
such
matter
before
and
that
suspicion
would
rest
the
more
readily
upon
him
what
did
you
do
then
you
made
some
small
job
in
my
lady  room
you
and
your
confederate
cusack
and
you
managed
that
he
should
be
the
man
sent
for
then
when
he
had
left
you
rifled
the
jewel
case
raised
the
alarm
and
had
this
unfortunate
man
arrested
you
then
ryder
threw
himself
down
suddenly
upon
the
rug
and
clutched
at
my
companion  knees
for
god  sake
have
mercy
he
shrieked
think
of
my
father
of
my
mother
it
would
break
their
hearts  never
went
wrong
before  never
will
again  swear
it  ll
swear
it
on  bible
oh
don  bring
it
into
court
for
christ  sake
don  get
back
into
your
chair
said
holmes
sternly
it
is
very
well
to
cringe
and
crawl
now
but
you
thought
little
enough
of
this
poor
horner
in
the
dock
for  crime
of
which
he
knew
nothing  will
fly
mr
holmes  will
leave
the
country
sir
then
the
charge
against
him
will
break
down
hum
we
will
talk
about
that
and
now
let
us
hear  true
account
of
the
next
act
how
came
the
stone
into
the
goose
and
how
came
the
goose
into
the
open
market
tell
us
the
truth
for
there
lies
your
only
hope
of
safety
ryder
passed
his
tongue
over
his
parched
lips  will
tell
you
it
just
as
it
happened
sir
said
he
when
horner
had
been
arrested
it
seemed
to
me
that
it
would
be
best
for
me
to
get
away
with
the
stone
at
once
for  did
not
know
at
what
moment
the
police
might
not
take
it
into
their
heads
to
search
me
and
my
room
there
was
no
place
about
the
hotel
where
it
would
be
safe  went
out
as
if
on
some
commission
and  made
for
my
sister  house
she
had
married  man
named
oakshott
and
lived
in
brixton
road
where
she
fattened
fowls
for
the
market
all
the
way
there
every
man  met
seemed
to
me
to
be  policeman
or  detective
and
for
all
that
it
was  cold
night
the
sweat
was
pouring
down
my
face
before  came
to
the
brixton
road
my
sister
asked
me
what
was
the
matter
and
why  was
so
pale
but  told
her
that  had
been
upset
by
the
jewel
robbery
at
the
hotel
then  went
into
the
back
yard
and
smoked  pipe
and
wondered
what
it
would
be
best
to
do  had  friend
once
called
maudsley
who
went
to
the
bad
and
has
just
been
serving
his
time
in
pentonville
one
day
he
had
met
me
and
fell
into
talk
about
the
ways
of
thieves
and
how
they
could
get
rid
of
what
they
stole  knew
that
he
would
be
true
to
me
for  knew
one
or
two
things
about
him
so  made
up
my
mind
to
go
right
on
to
kilburn
where
he
lived
and
take
him
into
my
confidence
he
would
show
me
how
to
turn
the
stone
into
money
but
how
to
get
to
him
in
safety  thought
of
the
agonies  had
gone
through
in
coming
from
the
hotel  might
at
any
moment
be
seized
and
searched
and
there
would
be
the
stone
in
my
waistcoat
pocket  was
leaning
against
the
wall
at
the
time
and
looking
at
the
geese
which
were
waddling
about
round
my
feet
and
suddenly
an
idea
came
into
my
head
which
showed
me
how  could
beat
the
best
detective
that
ever
lived
my
sister
had
told
me
some
weeks
before
that  might
have
the
pick
of
her
geese
for  christmas
present
and  knew
that
she
was
always
as
good
as
her
word  would
take
my
goose
now
and
in
it  would
carry
my
stone
to
kilburn
there
was  little
shed
in
the
yard
and
behind
this  drove
one
of
the
birds  fine
big
one
white
with  barred
tail  caught
it
and
prying
its
bill
open  thrust
the
stone
down
its
throat
as
far
as
my
finger
could
reach
the
bird
gave  gulp
and  felt
the
stone
pass
along
its
gullet
and
down
into
its
crop
but
the
creature
flapped
and
struggled
and
out
came
my
sister
to
know
what
was
the
matter
as  turned
to
speak
to
her
the
brute
broke
loose
and
fluttered
off
among
the
others
whatever
were
you
doing
with
that
bird
jem
says
she
well
said  you
said
you  give
me
one
for
christmas
and  was
feeling
which
was
the
fattest
oh
says
she
we
ve
set
yours
aside
for
you
jem  bird
we
call
it
it  the
big
white
one
over
yonder
there  twenty
six
of
them
which
makes
one
for
you
and
one
for
us
and
two
dozen
for
the
market
thank
you
maggie
says  but
if
it
is
all
the
same
to
you  d
rather
have
that
one  was
handling
just
now
the
other
is  good
three
pound
heavier
said
she
and
we
fattened
it
expressly
for
you
never
mind  ll
have
the
other
and  ll
take
it
now
said  oh
just
as
you
like
said
she  little
huffed
which
is
it
you
want
then
that
white
one
with
the
barred
tail
right
in
the
middle
of
the
flock
oh
very
well
kill
it
and
take
it
with
you
well  did
what
she
said
mr
holmes
and  carried
the
bird
all
the
way
to
kilburn  told
my
pal
what  had
done
for
he
was  man
that
it
was
easy
to
tell  thing
like
that
to
he
laughed
until
he
choked
and
we
got  knife
and
opened
the
goose
my
heart
turned
to
water
for
there
was
no
sign
of
the
stone
and  knew
that
some
terrible
mistake
had
occurred  left
the
bird
rushed
back
to
my
sister  and
hurried
into
the
back
yard
there
was
not  bird
to
be
seen
there
where
are
they
all
maggie  cried
gone
to
the
dealer  jem
which
dealer  breckinridge
of
covent
garden
but
was
there
another
with  barred
tail  asked
the
same
as
the
one  chose
yes
jem
there
were
two
barred
tailed
ones
and  could
never
tell
them
apart
well
then
of
course  saw
it
all
and  ran
off
as
hard
as
my
feet
would
carry
me
to
this
man
breckinridge
but
he
had
sold
the
lot
at
once
and
not
one
word
would
he
tell
me
as
to
where
they
had
gone
you
heard
him
yourselves
to
night
well
he
has
always
answered
me
like
that
my
sister
thinks
that  am
going
mad
sometimes  think
that  am
myself
and
now
and
now  am
myself  branded
thief
without
ever
having
touched
the
wealth
for
which  sold
my
character
god
help
me
god
help
me
he
burst
into
convulsive
sobbing
with
his
face
buried
in
his
hands
there
was  long
silence
broken
only
by
his
heavy
breathing
and
by
the
measured
tapping
of
sherlock
holmes
finger
tips
upon
the
edge
of
the
table
then
my
friend
rose
and
threw
open
the
door
get
out
said
he
what
sir
oh
heaven
bless
you
no
more
words
get
out
and
no
more
words
were
needed
there
was  rush  clatter
upon
the
stairs
the
bang
of  door
and
the
crisp
rattle
of
running
footfalls
from
the
street
after
all
watson
said
holmes
reaching
up
his
hand
for
his
clay
pipe  am
not
retained
by
the
police
to
supply
their
deficiencies
if
horner
were
in
danger
it
would
be
another
thing
but
this
fellow
will
not
appear
against
him
and
the
case
must
collapse  suppose
that  am
commuting  felony
but
it
is
just
possible
that  am
saving  soul
this
fellow
will
not
go
wrong
again
he
is
too
terribly
frightened
send
him
to
gaol
now
and
you
make
him  gaol
bird
for
life
besides
it
is
the
season
of
forgiveness
chance
has
put
in
our
way  most
singular
and
whimsical
problem
and
its
solution
is
its
own
reward
if
you
will
have
the
goodness
to
touch
the
bell
doctor
we
will
begin
another
investigation
in
which
also  bird
will
be
the
chief
feature
viii
the
adventure
of
the
speckled
band
on
glancing
over
my
notes
of
the
seventy
odd
cases
in
which  have
during
the
last
eight
years
studied
the
methods
of
my
friend
sherlock
holmes  find
many
tragic
some
comic  large
number
merely
strange
but
none
commonplace
for
working
as
he
did
rather
for
the
love
of
his
art
than
for
the
acquirement
of
wealth
he
refused
to
associate
himself
with
any
investigation
which
did
not
tend
towards
the
unusual
and
even
the
fantastic
of
all
these
varied
cases
however  cannot
recall
any
which
presented
more
singular
features
than
that
which
was
associated
with
the
well
known
surrey
family
of
the
roylotts
of
stoke
moran
the
events
in
question
occurred
in
the
early
days
of
my
association
with
holmes
when
we
were
sharing
rooms
as
bachelors
in
baker
street
it
is
possible
that  might
have
placed
them
upon
record
before
but  promise
of
secrecy
was
made
at
the
time
from
which  have
only
been
freed
during
the
last
month
by
the
untimely
death
of
the
lady
to
whom
the
pledge
was
given
it
is
perhaps
as
well
that
the
facts
should
now
come
to
light
for  have
reasons
to
know
that
there
are
widespread
rumours
as
to
the
death
of
dr
grimesby
roylott
which
tend
to
make
the
matter
even
more
terrible
than
the
truth
it
was
early
in
april
in
the
year
that  woke
one
morning
to
find
sherlock
holmes
standing
fully
dressed
by
the
side
of
my
bed
he
was  late
riser
as  rule
and
as
the
clock
on
the
mantelpiece
showed
me
that
it
was
only  quarter
past
seven  blinked
up
at
him
in
some
surprise
and
perhaps
just  little
resentment
for  was
myself
regular
in
my
habits
very
sorry
to
knock
you
up
watson
said
he
but
it  the
common
lot
this
morning
mrs
hudson
has
been
knocked
up
she
retorted
upon
me
and  on
you
what
is
it
then  fire
no  client
it
seems
that  young
lady
has
arrived
in  considerable
state
of
excitement
who
insists
upon
seeing
me
she
is
waiting
now
in
the
sitting
room
now
when
young
ladies
wander
about
the
metropolis
at
this
hour
of
the
morning
and
knock
sleepy
people
up
out
of
their
beds  presume
that
it
is
something
very
pressing
which
they
have
to
communicate
should
it
prove
to
be
an
interesting
case
you
would  am
sure
wish
to
follow
it
from
the
outset  thought
at
any
rate
that  should
call
you
and
give
you
the
chance
my
dear
fellow  would
not
miss
it
for
anything  had
no
keener
pleasure
than
in
following
holmes
in
his
professional
investigations
and
in
admiring
the
rapid
deductions
as
swift
as
intuitions
and
yet
always
founded
on  logical
basis
with
which
he
unravelled
the
problems
which
were
submitted
to
him  rapidly
threw
on
my
clothes
and
was
ready
in  few
minutes
to
accompany
my
friend
down
to
the
sitting
room  lady
dressed
in
black
and
heavily
veiled
who
had
been
sitting
in
the
window
rose
as
we
entered
good
morning
madam
said
holmes
cheerily
my
name
is
sherlock
holmes
this
is
my
intimate
friend
and
associate
dr
watson
before
whom
you
can
speak
as
freely
as
before
myself
ha  am
glad
to
see
that
mrs
hudson
has
had
the
good
sense
to
light
the
fire
pray
draw
up
to
it
and  shall
order
you  cup
of
hot
coffee
for  observe
that
you
are
shivering
it
is
not
cold
which
makes
me
shiver
said
the
woman
in  low
voice
changing
her
seat
as
requested
what
then
it
is
fear
mr
holmes
it
is
terror
she
raised
her
veil
as
she
spoke
and
we
could
see
that
she
was
indeed
in  pitiable
state
of
agitation
her
face
all
drawn
and
grey
with
restless
frightened
eyes
like
those
of
some
hunted
animal
her
features
and
figure
were
those
of  woman
of
thirty
but
her
hair
was
shot
with
premature
grey
and
her
expression
was
weary
and
haggard
sherlock
holmes
ran
her
over
with
one
of
his
quick
all
comprehensive
glances
you
must
not
fear
said
he
soothingly
bending
forward
and
patting
her
forearm
we
shall
soon
set
matters
right  have
no
doubt
you
have
come
in
by
train
this
morning  see
you
know
me
then
no
but  observe
the
second
half
of  return
ticket
in
the
palm
of
your
left
glove
you
must
have
started
early
and
yet
you
had  good
drive
in  dog
cart
along
heavy
roads
before
you
reached
the
station
the
lady
gave  violent
start
and
stared
in
bewilderment
at
my
companion
there
is
no
mystery
my
dear
madam
said
he
smiling
the
left
arm
of
your
jacket
is
spattered
with
mud
in
no
less
than
seven
places
the
marks
are
perfectly
fresh
there
is
no
vehicle
save  dog
cart
which
throws
up
mud
in
that
way
and
then
only
when
you
sit
on
the
left
hand
side
of
the
driver
whatever
your
reasons
may
be
you
are
perfectly
correct
said
she  started
from
home
before
six
reached
leatherhead
at
twenty
past
and
came
in
by
the
first
train
to
waterloo
sir  can
stand
this
strain
no
longer  shall
go
mad
if
it
continues  have
no
one
to
turn
to
none
save
only
one
who
cares
for
me
and
he
poor
fellow
can
be
of
little
aid  have
heard
of
you
mr
holmes  have
heard
of
you
from
mrs
farintosh
whom
you
helped
in
the
hour
of
her
sore
need
it
was
from
her
that  had
your
address
oh
sir
do
you
not
think
that
you
could
help
me
too
and
at
least
throw  little
light
through
the
dense
darkness
which
surrounds
me
at
present
it
is
out
of
my
power
to
reward
you
for
your
services
but
in  month
or
six
weeks  shall
be
married
with
the
control
of
my
own
income
and
then
at
least
you
shall
not
find
me
ungrateful
holmes
turned
to
his
desk
and
unlocking
it
drew
out  small
case
book
which
he
consulted
farintosh
said
he
ah
yes  recall
the
case
it
was
concerned
with
an
opal
tiara  think
it
was
before
your
time
watson  can
only
say
madam
that  shall
be
happy
to
devote
the
same
care
to
your
case
as  did
to
that
of
your
friend
as
to
reward
my
profession
is
its
own
reward
but
you
are
at
liberty
to
defray
whatever
expenses  may
be
put
to
at
the
time
which
suits
you
best
and
now  beg
that
you
will
lay
before
us
everything
that
may
help
us
in
forming
an
opinion
upon
the
matter
alas
replied
our
visitor
the
very
horror
of
my
situation
lies
in
the
fact
that
my
fears
are
so
vague
and
my
suspicions
depend
so
entirely
upon
small
points
which
might
seem
trivial
to
another
that
even
he
to
whom
of
all
others  have  right
to
look
for
help
and
advice
looks
upon
all
that  tell
him
about
it
as
the
fancies
of  nervous
woman
he
does
not
say
so
but  can
read
it
from
his
soothing
answers
and
averted
eyes
but  have
heard
mr
holmes
that
you
can
see
deeply
into
the
manifold
wickedness
of
the
human
heart
you
may
advise
me
how
to
walk
amid
the
dangers
which
encompass
me  am
all
attention
madam
my
name
is
helen
stoner
and  am
living
with
my
stepfather
who
is
the
last
survivor
of
one
of
the
oldest
saxon
families
in
england
the
roylotts
of
stoke
moran
on
the
western
border
of
surrey
holmes
nodded
his
head
the
name
is
familiar
to
me
said
he
the
family
was
at
one
time
among
the
richest
in
england
and
the
estates
extended
over
the
borders
into
berkshire
in
the
north
and
hampshire
in
the
west
in
the
last
century
however
four
successive
heirs
were
of  dissolute
and
wasteful
disposition
and
the
family
ruin
was
eventually
completed
by  gambler
in
the
days
of
the
regency
nothing
was
left
save  few
acres
of
ground
and
the
two
hundred
year
old
house
which
is
itself
crushed
under  heavy
mortgage
the
last
squire
dragged
out
his
existence
there
living
the
horrible
life
of
an
aristocratic
pauper
but
his
only
son
my
stepfather
seeing
that
he
must
adapt
himself
to
the
new
conditions
obtained
an
advance
from  relative
which
enabled
him
to
take  medical
degree
and
went
out
to
calcutta
where
by
his
professional
skill
and
his
force
of
character
he
established  large
practice
in  fit
of
anger
however
caused
by
some
robberies
which
had
been
perpetrated
in
the
house
he
beat
his
native
butler
to
death
and
narrowly
escaped  capital
sentence
as
it
was
he
suffered  long
term
of
imprisonment
and
afterwards
returned
to
england  morose
and
disappointed
man
when
dr
roylott
was
in
india
he
married
my
mother
mrs
stoner
the
young
widow
of
major
general
stoner
of
the
bengal
artillery
my
sister
julia
and  were
twins
and
we
were
only
two
years
old
at
the
time
of
my
mother  re
marriage
she
had  considerable
sum
of
money
not
less
than  year
and
this
she
bequeathed
to
dr
roylott
entirely
while
we
resided
with
him
with  provision
that  certain
annual
sum
should
be
allowed
to
each
of
us
in
the
event
of
our
marriage
shortly
after
our
return
to
england
my
mother
died
she
was
killed
eight
years
ago
in  railway
accident
near
crewe
dr
roylott
then
abandoned
his
attempts
to
establish
himself
in
practice
in
london
and
took
us
to
live
with
him
in
the
old
ancestral
house
at
stoke
moran
the
money
which
my
mother
had
left
was
enough
for
all
our
wants
and
there
seemed
to
be
no
obstacle
to
our
happiness
but  terrible
change
came
over
our
stepfather
about
this
time
instead
of
making
friends
and
exchanging
visits
with
our
neighbours
who
had
at
first
been
overjoyed
to
see  roylott
of
stoke
moran
back
in
the
old
family
seat
he
shut
himself
up
in
his
house
and
seldom
came
out
save
to
indulge
in
ferocious
quarrels
with
whoever
might
cross
his
path
violence
of
temper
approaching
to
mania
has
been
hereditary
in
the
men
of
the
family
and
in
my
stepfather  case
it
had  believe
been
intensified
by
his
long
residence
in
the
tropics  series
of
disgraceful
brawls
took
place
two
of
which
ended
in
the
police
court
until
at
last
he
became
the
terror
of
the
village
and
the
folks
would
fly
at
his
approach
for
he
is  man
of
immense
strength
and
absolutely
uncontrollable
in
his
anger
last
week
he
hurled
the
local
blacksmith
over  parapet
into  stream
and
it
was
only
by
paying
over
all
the
money
which  could
gather
together
that  was
able
to
avert
another
public
exposure
he
had
no
friends
at
all
save
the
wandering
gipsies
and
he
would
give
these
vagabonds
leave
to
encamp
upon
the
few
acres
of
bramble
covered
land
which
represent
the
family
estate
and
would
accept
in
return
the
hospitality
of
their
tents
wandering
away
with
them
sometimes
for
weeks
on
end
he
has  passion
also
for
indian
animals
which
are
sent
over
to
him
by  correspondent
and
he
has
at
this
moment  cheetah
and  baboon
which
wander
freely
over
his
grounds
and
are
feared
by
the
villagers
almost
as
much
as
their
master
you
can
imagine
from
what  say
that
my
poor
sister
julia
and  had
no
great
pleasure
in
our
lives
no
servant
would
stay
with
us
and
for  long
time
we
did
all
the
work
of
the
house
she
was
but
thirty
at
the
time
of
her
death
and
yet
her
hair
had
already
begun
to
whiten
even
as
mine
has
your
sister
is
dead
then
she
died
just
two
years
ago
and
it
is
of
her
death
that  wish
to
speak
to
you
you
can
understand
that
living
the
life
which  have
described
we
were
little
likely
to
see
anyone
of
our
own
age
and
position
we
had
however
an
aunt
my
mother  maiden
sister
miss
honoria
westphail
who
lives
near
harrow
and
we
were
occasionally
allowed
to
pay
short
visits
at
this
lady  house
julia
went
there
at
christmas
two
years
ago
and
met
there  half
pay
major
of
marines
to
whom
she
became
engaged
my
stepfather
learned
of
the
engagement
when
my
sister
returned
and
offered
no
objection
to
the
marriage
but
within  fortnight
of
the
day
which
had
been
fixed
for
the
wedding
the
terrible
event
occurred
which
has
deprived
me
of
my
only
companion
sherlock
holmes
had
been
leaning
back
in
his
chair
with
his
eyes
closed
and
his
head
sunk
in  cushion
but
he
half
opened
his
lids
now
and
glanced
across
at
his
visitor
pray
be
precise
as
to
details
said
he
it
is
easy
for
me
to
be
so
for
every
event
of
that
dreadful
time
is
seared
into
my
memory
the
manor
house
is
as  have
already
said
very
old
and
only
one
wing
is
now
inhabited
the
bedrooms
in
this
wing
are
on
the
ground
floor
the
sitting
rooms
being
in
the
central
block
of
the
buildings
of
these
bedrooms
the
first
is
dr
roylott  the
second
my
sister  and
the
third
my
own
there
is
no
communication
between
them
but
they
all
open
out
into
the
same
corridor
do  make
myself
plain
perfectly
so
the
windows
of
the
three
rooms
open
out
upon
the
lawn
that
fatal
night
dr
roylott
had
gone
to
his
room
early
though
we
knew
that
he
had
not
retired
to
rest
for
my
sister
was
troubled
by
the
smell
of
the
strong
indian
cigars
which
it
was
his
custom
to
smoke
she
left
her
room
therefore
and
came
into
mine
where
she
sat
for
some
time
chatting
about
her
approaching
wedding
at
eleven  clock
she
rose
to
leave
me
but
she
paused
at
the
door
and
looked
back
tell
me
helen
said
she
have
you
ever
heard
anyone
whistle
in
the
dead
of
the
night
never
said  i
suppose
that
you
could
not
possibly
whistle
yourself
in
your
sleep
certainly
not
but
why
because
during
the
last
few
nights  have
always
about
three
in
the
morning
heard  low
clear
whistle  am  light
sleeper
and
it
has
awakened
me  cannot
tell
where
it
came
from
perhaps
from
the
next
room
perhaps
from
the
lawn  thought
that  would
just
ask
you
whether
you
had
heard
it
no  have
not
it
must
be
those
wretched
gipsies
in
the
plantation
very
likely
and
yet
if
it
were
on
the
lawn  wonder
that
you
did
not
hear
it
also
ah
but  sleep
more
heavily
than
you
well
it
is
of
no
great
consequence
at
any
rate
she
smiled
back
at
me
closed
my
door
and  few
moments
later  heard
her
key
turn
in
the
lock
indeed
said
holmes
was
it
your
custom
always
to
lock
yourselves
in
at
night
always
and
why  think
that  mentioned
to
you
that
the
doctor
kept  cheetah
and  baboon
we
had
no
feeling
of
security
unless
our
doors
were
locked
quite
so
pray
proceed
with
your
statement  could
not
sleep
that
night  vague
feeling
of
impending
misfortune
impressed
me
my
sister
and  you
will
recollect
were
twins
and
you
know
how
subtle
are
the
links
which
bind
two
souls
which
are
so
closely
allied
it
was  wild
night
the
wind
was
howling
outside
and
the
rain
was
beating
and
splashing
against
the
windows
suddenly
amid
all
the
hubbub
of
the
gale
there
burst
forth
the
wild
scream
of  terrified
woman  knew
that
it
was
my
sister  voice  sprang
from
my
bed
wrapped  shawl
round
me
and
rushed
into
the
corridor
as  opened
my
door  seemed
to
hear  low
whistle
such
as
my
sister
described
and  few
moments
later  clanging
sound
as
if  mass
of
metal
had
fallen
as  ran
down
the
passage
my
sister  door
was
unlocked
and
revolved
slowly
upon
its
hinges  stared
at
it
horror
stricken
not
knowing
what
was
about
to
issue
from
it
by
the
light
of
the
corridor
lamp  saw
my
sister
appear
at
the
opening
her
face
blanched
with
terror
her
hands
groping
for
help
her
whole
figure
swaying
to
and
fro
like
that
of  drunkard  ran
to
her
and
threw
my
arms
round
her
but
at
that
moment
her
knees
seemed
to
give
way
and
she
fell
to
the
ground
she
writhed
as
one
who
is
in
terrible
pain
and
her
limbs
were
dreadfully
convulsed
at
first  thought
that
she
had
not
recognised
me
but
as  bent
over
her
she
suddenly
shrieked
out
in  voice
which  shall
never
forget
oh
my
god
helen
it
was
the
band
the
speckled
band
there
was
something
else
which
she
would
fain
have
said
and
she
stabbed
with
her
finger
into
the
air
in
the
direction
of
the
doctor  room
but  fresh
convulsion
seized
her
and
choked
her
words  rushed
out
calling
loudly
for
my
stepfather
and  met
him
hastening
from
his
room
in
his
dressing
gown
when
he
reached
my
sister  side
she
was
unconscious
and
though
he
poured
brandy
down
her
throat
and
sent
for
medical
aid
from
the
village
all
efforts
were
in
vain
for
she
slowly
sank
and
died
without
having
recovered
her
consciousness
such
was
the
dreadful
end
of
my
beloved
sister
one
moment
said
holmes
are
you
sure
about
this
whistle
and
metallic
sound
could
you
swear
to
it
that
was
what
the
county
coroner
asked
me
at
the
inquiry
it
is
my
strong
impression
that  heard
it
and
yet
among
the
crash
of
the
gale
and
the
creaking
of
an
old
house  may
possibly
have
been
deceived
was
your
sister
dressed
no
she
was
in
her
night
dress
in
her
right
hand
was
found
the
charred
stump
of  match
and
in
her
left  match
box
showing
that
she
had
struck  light
and
looked
about
her
when
the
alarm
took
place
that
is
important
and
what
conclusions
did
the
coroner
come
to
he
investigated
the
case
with
great
care
for
dr
roylott  conduct
had
long
been
notorious
in
the
county
but
he
was
unable
to
find
any
satisfactory
cause
of
death
my
evidence
showed
that
the
door
had
been
fastened
upon
the
inner
side
and
the
windows
were
blocked
by
old
fashioned
shutters
with
broad
iron
bars
which
were
secured
every
night
the
walls
were
carefully
sounded
and
were
shown
to
be
quite
solid
all
round
and
the
flooring
was
also
thoroughly
examined
with
the
same
result
the
chimney
is
wide
but
is
barred
up
by
four
large
staples
it
is
certain
therefore
that
my
sister
was
quite
alone
when
she
met
her
end
besides
there
were
no
marks
of
any
violence
upon
her
how
about
poison
the
doctors
examined
her
for
it
but
without
success
what
do
you
think
that
this
unfortunate
lady
died
of
then
it
is
my
belief
that
she
died
of
pure
fear
and
nervous
shock
though
what
it
was
that
frightened
her  cannot
imagine
were
there
gipsies
in
the
plantation
at
the
time
yes
there
are
nearly
always
some
there
ah
and
what
did
you
gather
from
this
allusion
to  band  speckled
band
sometimes  have
thought
that
it
was
merely
the
wild
talk
of
delirium
sometimes
that
it
may
have
referred
to
some
band
of
people
perhaps
to
these
very
gipsies
in
the
plantation  do
not
know
whether
the
spotted
handkerchiefs
which
so
many
of
them
wear
over
their
heads
might
have
suggested
the
strange
adjective
which
she
used
holmes
shook
his
head
like  man
who
is
far
from
being
satisfied
these
are
very
deep
waters
said
he
pray
go
on
with
your
narrative
two
years
have
passed
since
then
and
my
life
has
been
until
lately
lonelier
than
ever  month
ago
however  dear
friend
whom  have
known
for
many
years
has
done
me
the
honour
to
ask
my
hand
in
marriage
his
name
is
armitage
percy
armitage
the
second
son
of
mr
armitage
of
crane
water
near
reading
my
stepfather
has
offered
no
opposition
to
the
match
and
we
are
to
be
married
in
the
course
of
the
spring
two
days
ago
some
repairs
were
started
in
the
west
wing
of
the
building
and
my
bedroom
wall
has
been
pierced
so
that  have
had
to
move
into
the
chamber
in
which
my
sister
died
and
to
sleep
in
the
very
bed
in
which
she
slept
imagine
then
my
thrill
of
terror
when
last
night
as  lay
awake
thinking
over
her
terrible
fate  suddenly
heard
in
the
silence
of
the
night
the
low
whistle
which
had
been
the
herald
of
her
own
death  sprang
up
and
lit
the
lamp
but
nothing
was
to
be
seen
in
the
room  was
too
shaken
to
go
to
bed
again
however
so  dressed
and
as
soon
as
it
was
daylight  slipped
down
got  dog
cart
at
the
crown
inn
which
is
opposite
and
drove
to
leatherhead
from
whence  have
come
on
this
morning
with
the
one
object
of
seeing
you
and
asking
your
advice
you
have
done
wisely
said
my
friend
but
have
you
told
me
all
yes
all
miss
roylott
you
have
not
you
are
screening
your
stepfather
why
what
do
you
mean
for
answer
holmes
pushed
back
the
frill
of
black
lace
which
fringed
the
hand
that
lay
upon
our
visitor  knee
five
little
livid
spots
the
marks
of
four
fingers
and  thumb
were
printed
upon
the
white
wrist
you
have
been
cruelly
used
said
holmes
the
lady
coloured
deeply
and
covered
over
her
injured
wrist
he
is  hard
man
she
said
and
perhaps
he
hardly
knows
his
own
strength
there
was  long
silence
during
which
holmes
leaned
his
chin
upon
his
hands
and
stared
into
the
crackling
fire
this
is  very
deep
business
he
said
at
last
there
are  thousand
details
which  should
desire
to
know
before  decide
upon
our
course
of
action
yet
we
have
not  moment
to
lose
if
we
were
to
come
to
stoke
moran
to
day
would
it
be
possible
for
us
to
see
over
these
rooms
without
the
knowledge
of
your
stepfather
as
it
happens
he
spoke
of
coming
into
town
to
day
upon
some
most
important
business
it
is
probable
that
he
will
be
away
all
day
and
that
there
would
be
nothing
to
disturb
you
we
have  housekeeper
now
but
she
is
old
and
foolish
and  could
easily
get
her
out
of
the
way
excellent
you
are
not
averse
to
this
trip
watson
by
no
means
then
we
shall
both
come
what
are
you
going
to
do
yourself  have
one
or
two
things
which  would
wish
to
do
now
that  am
in
town
but  shall
return
by
the
twelve  clock
train
so
as
to
be
there
in
time
for
your
coming
and
you
may
expect
us
early
in
the
afternoon  have
myself
some
small
business
matters
to
attend
to
will
you
not
wait
and
breakfast
no  must
go
my
heart
is
lightened
already
since  have
confided
my
trouble
to
you  shall
look
forward
to
seeing
you
again
this
afternoon
she
dropped
her
thick
black
veil
over
her
face
and
glided
from
the
room
and
what
do
you
think
of
it
all
watson
asked
sherlock
holmes
leaning
back
in
his
chair
it
seems
to
me
to
be  most
dark
and
sinister
business
dark
enough
and
sinister
enough
yet
if
the
lady
is
correct
in
saying
that
the
flooring
and
walls
are
sound
and
that
the
door
window
and
chimney
are
impassable
then
her
sister
must
have
been
undoubtedly
alone
when
she
met
her
mysterious
end
what
becomes
then
of
these
nocturnal
whistles
and
what
of
the
very
peculiar
words
of
the
dying
woman  cannot
think
when
you
combine
the
ideas
of
whistles
at
night
the
presence
of  band
of
gipsies
who
are
on
intimate
terms
with
this
old
doctor
the
fact
that
we
have
every
reason
to
believe
that
the
doctor
has
an
interest
in
preventing
his
stepdaughter  marriage
the
dying
allusion
to  band
and
finally
the
fact
that
miss
helen
stoner
heard  metallic
clang
which
might
have
been
caused
by
one
of
those
metal
bars
that
secured
the
shutters
falling
back
into
its
place  think
that
there
is
good
ground
to
think
that
the
mystery
may
be
cleared
along
those
lines
but
what
then
did
the
gipsies
do  cannot
imagine  see
many
objections
to
any
such
theory
and
so
do  it
is
precisely
for
that
reason
that
we
are
going
to
stoke
moran
this
day  want
to
see
whether
the
objections
are
fatal
or
if
they
may
be
explained
away
but
what
in
the
name
of
the
devil
the
ejaculation
had
been
drawn
from
my
companion
by
the
fact
that
our
door
had
been
suddenly
dashed
open
and
that  huge
man
had
framed
himself
in
the
aperture
his
costume
was  peculiar
mixture
of
the
professional
and
of
the
agricultural
having  black
top
hat  long
frock
coat
and  pair
of
high
gaiters
with  hunting
crop
swinging
in
his
hand
so
tall
was
he
that
his
hat
actually
brushed
the
cross
bar
of
the
doorway
and
his
breadth
seemed
to
span
it
across
from
side
to
side  large
face
seared
with  thousand
wrinkles
burned
yellow
with
the
sun
and
marked
with
every
evil
passion
was
turned
from
one
to
the
other
of
us
while
his
deep
set
bile
shot
eyes
and
his
high
thin
fleshless
nose
gave
him
somewhat
the
resemblance
to  fierce
old
bird
of
prey
which
of
you
is
holmes
asked
this
apparition
my
name
sir
but
you
have
the
advantage
of
me
said
my
companion
quietly  am
dr
grimesby
roylott
of
stoke
moran
indeed
doctor
said
holmes
blandly
pray
take  seat  will
do
nothing
of
the
kind
my
stepdaughter
has
been
here  have
traced
her
what
has
she
been
saying
to
you
it
is  little
cold
for
the
time
of
the
year
said
holmes
what
has
she
been
saying
to
you
screamed
the
old
man
furiously
but  have
heard
that
the
crocuses
promise
well
continued
my
companion
imperturbably
ha
you
put
me
off
do
you
said
our
new
visitor
taking  step
forward
and
shaking
his
hunting
crop  know
you
you
scoundrel  have
heard
of
you
before
you
are
holmes
the
meddler
my
friend
smiled
holmes
the
busybody
his
smile
broadened
holmes
the
scotland
yard
jack
in
office
holmes
chuckled
heartily
your
conversation
is
most
entertaining
said
he
when
you
go
out
close
the
door
for
there
is  decided
draught  will
go
when  have
said
my
say
don  you
dare
to
meddle
with
my
affairs  know
that
miss
stoner
has
been
here  traced
her  am  dangerous
man
to
fall
foul
of
see
here
he
stepped
swiftly
forward
seized
the
poker
and
bent
it
into  curve
with
his
huge
brown
hands
see
that
you
keep
yourself
out
of
my
grip
he
snarled
and
hurling
the
twisted
poker
into
the
fireplace
he
strode
out
of
the
room
he
seems  very
amiable
person
said
holmes
laughing  am
not
quite
so
bulky
but
if
he
had
remained  might
have
shown
him
that
my
grip
was
not
much
more
feeble
than
his
own
as
he
spoke
he
picked
up
the
steel
poker
and
with  sudden
effort
straightened
it
out
again
fancy
his
having
the
insolence
to
confound
me
with
the
official
detective
force
this
incident
gives
zest
to
our
investigation
however
and  only
trust
that
our
little
friend
will
not
suffer
from
her
imprudence
in
allowing
this
brute
to
trace
her
and
now
watson
we
shall
order
breakfast
and
afterwards  shall
walk
down
to
doctors
commons
where  hope
to
get
some
data
which
may
help
us
in
this
matter
it
was
nearly
one  clock
when
sherlock
holmes
returned
from
his
excursion
he
held
in
his
hand  sheet
of
blue
paper
scrawled
over
with
notes
and
figures  have
seen
the
will
of
the
deceased
wife
said
he
to
determine
its
exact
meaning  have
been
obliged
to
work
out
the
present
prices
of
the
investments
with
which
it
is
concerned
the
total
income
which
at
the
time
of
the
wife  death
was
little
short
of
is
now
through
the
fall
in
agricultural
prices
not
more
than
each
daughter
can
claim
an
income
of
in
case
of
marriage
it
is
evident
therefore
that
if
both
girls
had
married
this
beauty
would
have
had  mere
pittance
while
even
one
of
them
would
cripple
him
to  very
serious
extent
my
morning  work
has
not
been
wasted
since
it
has
proved
that
he
has
the
very
strongest
motives
for
standing
in
the
way
of
anything
of
the
sort
and
now
watson
this
is
too
serious
for
dawdling
especially
as
the
old
man
is
aware
that
we
are
interesting
ourselves
in
his
affairs
so
if
you
are
ready
we
shall
call  cab
and
drive
to
waterloo  should
be
very
much
obliged
if
you
would
slip
your
revolver
into
your
pocket
an
eley  no
is
an
excellent
argument
with
gentlemen
who
can
twist
steel
pokers
into
knots
that
and  tooth
brush
are  think
all
that
we
need
at
waterloo
we
were
fortunate
in
catching  train
for
leatherhead
where
we
hired  trap
at
the
station
inn
and
drove
for
four
or
five
miles
through
the
lovely
surrey
lanes
it
was  perfect
day
with  bright
sun
and  few
fleecy
clouds
in
the
heavens
the
trees
and
wayside
hedges
were
just
throwing
out
their
first
green
shoots
and
the
air
was
full
of
the
pleasant
smell
of
the
moist
earth
to
me
at
least
there
was  strange
contrast
between
the
sweet
promise
of
the
spring
and
this
sinister
quest
upon
which
we
were
engaged
my
companion
sat
in
the
front
of
the
trap
his
arms
folded
his
hat
pulled
down
over
his
eyes
and
his
chin
sunk
upon
his
breast
buried
in
the
deepest
thought
suddenly
however
he
started
tapped
me
on
the
shoulder
and
pointed
over
the
meadows
look
there
said
he  heavily
timbered
park
stretched
up
in  gentle
slope
thickening
into  grove
at
the
highest
point
from
amid
the
branches
there
jutted
out
the
grey
gables
and
high
roof
tree
of  very
old
mansion
stoke
moran
said
he
yes
sir
that
be
the
house
of
dr
grimesby
roylott
remarked
the
driver
there
is
some
building
going
on
there
said
holmes
that
is
where
we
are
going
there  the
village
said
the
driver
pointing
to  cluster
of
roofs
some
distance
to
the
left
but
if
you
want
to
get
to
the
house
you
ll
find
it
shorter
to
get
over
this
stile
and
so
by
the
foot
path
over
the
fields
there
it
is
where
the
lady
is
walking
and
the
lady  fancy
is
miss
stoner
observed
holmes
shading
his
eyes
yes  think
we
had
better
do
as
you
suggest
we
got
off
paid
our
fare
and
the
trap
rattled
back
on
its
way
to
leatherhead  thought
it
as
well
said
holmes
as
we
climbed
the
stile
that
this
fellow
should
think
we
had
come
here
as
architects
or
on
some
definite
business
it
may
stop
his
gossip
good
afternoon
miss
stoner
you
see
that
we
have
been
as
good
as
our
word
our
client
of
the
morning
had
hurried
forward
to
meet
us
with  face
which
spoke
her
joy  have
been
waiting
so
eagerly
for
you
she
cried
shaking
hands
with
us
warmly
all
has
turned
out
splendidly
dr
roylott
has
gone
to
town
and
it
is
unlikely
that
he
will
be
back
before
evening
we
have
had
the
pleasure
of
making
the
doctor  acquaintance
said
holmes
and
in  few
words
he
sketched
out
what
had
occurred
miss
stoner
turned
white
to
the
lips
as
she
listened
good
heavens
she
cried
he
has
followed
me
then
so
it
appears
he
is
so
cunning
that  never
know
when  am
safe
from
him
what
will
he
say
when
he
returns
he
must
guard
himself
for
he
may
find
that
there
is
someone
more
cunning
than
himself
upon
his
track
you
must
lock
yourself
up
from
him
to
night
if
he
is
violent
we
shall
take
you
away
to
your
aunt  at
harrow
now
we
must
make
the
best
use
of
our
time
so
kindly
take
us
at
once
to
the
rooms
which
we
are
to
examine
the
building
was
of
grey
lichen
blotched
stone
with  high
central
portion
and
two
curving
wings
like
the
claws
of  crab
thrown
out
on
each
side
in
one
of
these
wings
the
windows
were
broken
and
blocked
with
wooden
boards
while
the
roof
was
partly
caved
in  picture
of
ruin
the
central
portion
was
in
little
better
repair
but
the
right
hand
block
was
comparatively
modern
and
the
blinds
in
the
windows
with
the
blue
smoke
curling
up
from
the
chimneys
showed
that
this
was
where
the
family
resided
some
scaffolding
had
been
erected
against
the
end
wall
and
the
stone
work
had
been
broken
into
but
there
were
no
signs
of
any
workmen
at
the
moment
of
our
visit
holmes
walked
slowly
up
and
down
the
ill
trimmed
lawn
and
examined
with
deep
attention
the
outsides
of
the
windows
this  take
it
belongs
to
the
room
in
which
you
used
to
sleep
the
centre
one
to
your
sister  and
the
one
next
to
the
main
building
to
dr
roylott  chamber
exactly
so
but  am
now
sleeping
in
the
middle
one
pending
the
alterations
as  understand
by
the
way
there
does
not
seem
to
be
any
very
pressing
need
for
repairs
at
that
end
wall
there
were
none  believe
that
it
was
an
excuse
to
move
me
from
my
room
ah
that
is
suggestive
now
on
the
other
side
of
this
narrow
wing
runs
the
corridor
from
which
these
three
rooms
open
there
are
windows
in
it
of
course
yes
but
very
small
ones
too
narrow
for
anyone
to
pass
through
as
you
both
locked
your
doors
at
night
your
rooms
were
unapproachable
from
that
side
now
would
you
have
the
kindness
to
go
into
your
room
and
bar
your
shutters
miss
stoner
did
so
and
holmes
after  careful
examination
through
the
open
window
endeavoured
in
every
way
to
force
the
shutter
open
but
without
success
there
was
no
slit
through
which  knife
could
be
passed
to
raise
the
bar
then
with
his
lens
he
tested
the
hinges
but
they
were
of
solid
iron
built
firmly
into
the
massive
masonry
hum
said
he
scratching
his
chin
in
some
perplexity
my
theory
certainly
presents
some
difficulties
no
one
could
pass
these
shutters
if
they
were
bolted
well
we
shall
see
if
the
inside
throws
any
light
upon
the
matter  small
side
door
led
into
the
whitewashed
corridor
from
which
the
three
bedrooms
opened
holmes
refused
to
examine
the
third
chamber
so
we
passed
at
once
to
the
second
that
in
which
miss
stoner
was
now
sleeping
and
in
which
her
sister
had
met
with
her
fate
it
was  homely
little
room
with  low
ceiling
and  gaping
fireplace
after
the
fashion
of
old
country
houses  brown
chest
of
drawers
stood
in
one
corner  narrow
white
counterpaned
bed
in
another
and  dressing
table
on
the
left
hand
side
of
the
window
these
articles
with
two
small
wicker
work
chairs
made
up
all
the
furniture
in
the
room
save
for  square
of
wilton
carpet
in
the
centre
the
boards
round
and
the
panelling
of
the
walls
were
of
brown
worm
eaten
oak
so
old
and
discoloured
that
it
may
have
dated
from
the
original
building
of
the
house
holmes
drew
one
of
the
chairs
into  corner
and
sat
silent
while
his
eyes
travelled
round
and
round
and
up
and
down
taking
in
every
detail
of
the
apartment
where
does
that
bell
communicate
with
he
asked
at
last
pointing
to  thick
bell
rope
which
hung
down
beside
the
bed
the
tassel
actually
lying
upon
the
pillow
it
goes
to
the
housekeeper  room
it
looks
newer
than
the
other
things
yes
it
was
only
put
there  couple
of
years
ago
your
sister
asked
for
it  suppose
no  never
heard
of
her
using
it
we
used
always
to
get
what
we
wanted
for
ourselves
indeed
it
seemed
unnecessary
to
put
so
nice  bell
pull
there
you
will
excuse
me
for  few
minutes
while  satisfy
myself
as
to
this
floor
he
threw
himself
down
upon
his
face
with
his
lens
in
his
hand
and
crawled
swiftly
backward
and
forward
examining
minutely
the
cracks
between
the
boards
then
he
did
the
same
with
the
wood
work
with
which
the
chamber
was
panelled
finally
he
walked
over
to
the
bed
and
spent
some
time
in
staring
at
it
and
in
running
his
eye
up
and
down
the
wall
finally
he
took
the
bell
rope
in
his
hand
and
gave
it  brisk
tug
why
it  a
dummy
said
he
won  it
ring
no
it
is
not
even
attached
to  wire
this
is
very
interesting
you
can
see
now
that
it
is
fastened
to  hook
just
above
where
the
little
opening
for
the
ventilator
is
how
very
absurd  never
noticed
that
before
very
strange
muttered
holmes
pulling
at
the
rope
there
are
one
or
two
very
singular
points
about
this
room
for
example
what  fool  builder
must
be
to
open  ventilator
into
another
room
when
with
the
same
trouble
he
might
have
communicated
with
the
outside
air
that
is
also
quite
modern
said
the
lady
done
about
the
same
time
as
the
bell
rope
remarked
holmes
yes
there
were
several
little
changes
carried
out
about
that
time
they
seem
to
have
been
of  most
interesting
character
dummy
bell
ropes
and
ventilators
which
do
not
ventilate
with
your
permission
miss
stoner
we
shall
now
carry
our
researches
into
the
inner
apartment
dr
grimesby
roylott  chamber
was
larger
than
that
of
his
step
daughter
but
was
as
plainly
furnished  camp
bed  small
wooden
shelf
full
of
books
mostly
of  technical
character
an
armchair
beside
the
bed  plain
wooden
chair
against
the
wall  round
table
and  large
iron
safe
were
the
principal
things
which
met
the
eye
holmes
walked
slowly
round
and
examined
each
and
all
of
them
with
the
keenest
interest
what  in
here
he
asked
tapping
the
safe
my
stepfather  business
papers
oh
you
have
seen
inside
then
only
once
some
years
ago  remember
that
it
was
full
of
papers
there
isn  a
cat
in
it
for
example
no
what  strange
idea
well
look
at
this
he
took
up  small
saucer
of
milk
which
stood
on
the
top
of
it
no
we
don  keep  cat
but
there
is  cheetah
and  baboon
ah
yes
of
course
well  cheetah
is
just  big
cat
and
yet  saucer
of
milk
does
not
go
very
far
in
satisfying
its
wants  daresay
there
is
one
point
which  should
wish
to
determine
he
squatted
down
in
front
of
the
wooden
chair
and
examined
the
seat
of
it
with
the
greatest
attention
thank
you
that
is
quite
settled
said
he
rising
and
putting
his
lens
in
his
pocket
hullo
here
is
something
interesting
the
object
which
had
caught
his
eye
was  small
dog
lash
hung
on
one
corner
of
the
bed
the
lash
however
was
curled
upon
itself
and
tied
so
as
to
make  loop
of
whipcord
what
do
you
make
of
that
watson
it  a
common
enough
lash
but  don  know
why
it
should
be
tied
that
is
not
quite
so
common
is
it
ah
me
it  a
wicked
world
and
when  clever
man
turns
his
brains
to
crime
it
is
the
worst
of
all  think
that  have
seen
enough
now
miss
stoner
and
with
your
permission
we
shall
walk
out
upon
the
lawn  had
never
seen
my
friend  face
so
grim
or
his
brow
so
dark
as
it
was
when
we
turned
from
the
scene
of
this
investigation
we
had
walked
several
times
up
and
down
the
lawn
neither
miss
stoner
nor
myself
liking
to
break
in
upon
his
thoughts
before
he
roused
himself
from
his
reverie
it
is
very
essential
miss
stoner
said
he
that
you
should
absolutely
follow
my
advice
in
every
respect  shall
most
certainly
do
so
the
matter
is
too
serious
for
any
hesitation
your
life
may
depend
upon
your
compliance  assure
you
that  am
in
your
hands
in
the
first
place
both
my
friend
and  must
spend
the
night
in
your
room
both
miss
stoner
and  gazed
at
him
in
astonishment
yes
it
must
be
so
let
me
explain  believe
that
that
is
the
village
inn
over
there
yes
that
is
the
crown
very
good
your
windows
would
be
visible
from
there
certainly
you
must
confine
yourself
to
your
room
on
pretence
of  headache
when
your
stepfather
comes
back
then
when
you
hear
him
retire
for
the
night
you
must
open
the
shutters
of
your
window
undo
the
hasp
put
your
lamp
there
as  signal
to
us
and
then
withdraw
quietly
with
everything
which
you
are
likely
to
want
into
the
room
which
you
used
to
occupy  have
no
doubt
that
in
spite
of
the
repairs
you
could
manage
there
for
one
night
oh
yes
easily
the
rest
you
will
leave
in
our
hands
but
what
will
you
do
we
shall
spend
the
night
in
your
room
and
we
shall
investigate
the
cause
of
this
noise
which
has
disturbed
you  believe
mr
holmes
that
you
have
already
made
up
your
mind
said
miss
stoner
laying
her
hand
upon
my
companion  sleeve
perhaps  have
then
for
pity  sake
tell
me
what
was
the
cause
of
my
sister  death  should
prefer
to
have
clearer
proofs
before  speak
you
can
at
least
tell
me
whether
my
own
thought
is
correct
and
if
she
died
from
some
sudden
fright
no  do
not
think
so  think
that
there
was
probably
some
more
tangible
cause
and
now
miss
stoner
we
must
leave
you
for
if
dr
roylott
returned
and
saw
us
our
journey
would
be
in
vain
good
bye
and
be
brave
for
if
you
will
do
what  have
told
you
you
may
rest
assured
that
we
shall
soon
drive
away
the
dangers
that
threaten
you
sherlock
holmes
and  had
no
difficulty
in
engaging  bedroom
and
sitting
room
at
the
crown
inn
they
were
on
the
upper
floor
and
from
our
window
we
could
command  view
of
the
avenue
gate
and
of
the
inhabited
wing
of
stoke
moran
manor
house
at
dusk
we
saw
dr
grimesby
roylott
drive
past
his
huge
form
looming
up
beside
the
little
figure
of
the
lad
who
drove
him
the
boy
had
some
slight
difficulty
in
undoing
the
heavy
iron
gates
and
we
heard
the
hoarse
roar
of
the
doctor  voice
and
saw
the
fury
with
which
he
shook
his
clinched
fists
at
him
the
trap
drove
on
and  few
minutes
later
we
saw  sudden
light
spring
up
among
the
trees
as
the
lamp
was
lit
in
one
of
the
sitting
rooms
do
you
know
watson
said
holmes
as
we
sat
together
in
the
gathering
darkness  have
really
some
scruples
as
to
taking
you
to
night
there
is  distinct
element
of
danger
can  be
of
assistance
your
presence
might
be
invaluable
then  shall
certainly
come
it
is
very
kind
of
you
you
speak
of
danger
you
have
evidently
seen
more
in
these
rooms
than
was
visible
to
me
no
but  fancy
that  may
have
deduced  little
more  imagine
that
you
saw
all
that  did  saw
nothing
remarkable
save
the
bell
rope
and
what
purpose
that
could
answer  confess
is
more
than  can
imagine
you
saw
the
ventilator
too
yes
but  do
not
think
that
it
is
such  very
unusual
thing
to
have  small
opening
between
two
rooms
it
was
so
small
that  rat
could
hardly
pass
through  knew
that
we
should
find  ventilator
before
ever
we
came
to
stoke
moran
my
dear
holmes
oh
yes  did
you
remember
in
her
statement
she
said
that
her
sister
could
smell
dr
roylott  cigar
now
of
course
that
suggested
at
once
that
there
must
be  communication
between
the
two
rooms
it
could
only
be  small
one
or
it
would
have
been
remarked
upon
at
the
coroner  inquiry  deduced  ventilator
but
what
harm
can
there
be
in
that
well
there
is
at
least  curious
coincidence
of
dates  ventilator
is
made  cord
is
hung
and  lady
who
sleeps
in
the
bed
dies
does
not
that
strike
you  cannot
as
yet
see
any
connection
did
you
observe
anything
very
peculiar
about
that
bed
no
it
was
clamped
to
the
floor
did
you
ever
see  bed
fastened
like
that
before  cannot
say
that  have
the
lady
could
not
move
her
bed
it
must
always
be
in
the
same
relative
position
to
the
ventilator
and
to
the
rope
or
so
we
may
call
it
since
it
was
clearly
never
meant
for  bell
pull
holmes  cried  seem
to
see
dimly
what
you
are
hinting
at
we
are
only
just
in
time
to
prevent
some
subtle
and
horrible
crime
subtle
enough
and
horrible
enough
when  doctor
does
go
wrong
he
is
the
first
of
criminals
he
has
nerve
and
he
has
knowledge
palmer
and
pritchard
were
among
the
heads
of
their
profession
this
man
strikes
even
deeper
but  think
watson
that
we
shall
be
able
to
strike
deeper
still
but
we
shall
have
horrors
enough
before
the
night
is
over
for
goodness
sake
let
us
have  quiet
pipe
and
turn
our
minds
for  few
hours
to
something
more
cheerful
about
nine  clock
the
light
among
the
trees
was
extinguished
and
all
was
dark
in
the
direction
of
the
manor
house
two
hours
passed
slowly
away
and
then
suddenly
just
at
the
stroke
of
eleven  single
bright
light
shone
out
right
in
front
of
us
that
is
our
signal
said
holmes
springing
to
his
feet
it
comes
from
the
middle
window
as
we
passed
out
he
exchanged  few
words
with
the
landlord
explaining
that
we
were
going
on  late
visit
to
an
acquaintance
and
that
it
was
possible
that
we
might
spend
the
night
there  moment
later
we
were
out
on
the
dark
road  chill
wind
blowing
in
our
faces
and
one
yellow
light
twinkling
in
front
of
us
through
the
gloom
to
guide
us
on
our
sombre
errand
there
was
little
difficulty
in
entering
the
grounds
for
unrepaired
breaches
gaped
in
the
old
park
wall
making
our
way
among
the
trees
we
reached
the
lawn
crossed
it
and
were
about
to
enter
through
the
window
when
out
from  clump
of
laurel
bushes
there
darted
what
seemed
to
be  hideous
and
distorted
child
who
threw
itself
upon
the
grass
with
writhing
limbs
and
then
ran
swiftly
across
the
lawn
into
the
darkness
my
god  whispered
did
you
see
it
holmes
was
for
the
moment
as
startled
as  his
hand
closed
like  vice
upon
my
wrist
in
his
agitation
then
he
broke
into  low
laugh
and
put
his
lips
to
my
ear
it
is  nice
household
he
murmured
that
is
the
baboon  had
forgotten
the
strange
pets
which
the
doctor
affected
there
was  cheetah
too
perhaps
we
might
find
it
upon
our
shoulders
at
any
moment  confess
that  felt
easier
in
my
mind
when
after
following
holmes
example
and
slipping
off
my
shoes  found
myself
inside
the
bedroom
my
companion
noiselessly
closed
the
shutters
moved
the
lamp
onto
the
table
and
cast
his
eyes
round
the
room
all
was
as
we
had
seen
it
in
the
daytime
then
creeping
up
to
me
and
making  trumpet
of
his
hand
he
whispered
into
my
ear
again
so
gently
that
it
was
all
that  could
do
to
distinguish
the
words
the
least
sound
would
be
fatal
to
our
plans  nodded
to
show
that  had
heard
we
must
sit
without
light
he
would
see
it
through
the
ventilator  nodded
again
do
not
go
asleep
your
very
life
may
depend
upon
it
have
your
pistol
ready
in
case
we
should
need
it  will
sit
on
the
side
of
the
bed
and
you
in
that
chair  took
out
my
revolver
and
laid
it
on
the
corner
of
the
table
holmes
had
brought
up  long
thin
cane
and
this
he
placed
upon
the
bed
beside
him
by
it
he
laid
the
box
of
matches
and
the
stump
of  candle
then
he
turned
down
the
lamp
and
we
were
left
in
darkness
how
shall  ever
forget
that
dreadful
vigil  could
not
hear  sound
not
even
the
drawing
of  breath
and
yet  knew
that
my
companion
sat
open
eyed
within  few
feet
of
me
in
the
same
state
of
nervous
tension
in
which  was
myself
the
shutters
cut
off
the
least
ray
of
light
and
we
waited
in
absolute
darkness
from
outside
came
the
occasional
cry
of  night
bird
and
once
at
our
very
window  long
drawn
catlike
whine
which
told
us
that
the
cheetah
was
indeed
at
liberty
far
away
we
could
hear
the
deep
tones
of
the
parish
clock
which
boomed
out
every
quarter
of
an
hour
how
long
they
seemed
those
quarters
twelve
struck
and
one
and
two
and
three
and
still
we
sat
waiting
silently
for
whatever
might
befall
suddenly
there
was
the
momentary
gleam
of  light
up
in
the
direction
of
the
ventilator
which
vanished
immediately
but
was
succeeded
by  strong
smell
of
burning
oil
and
heated
metal
someone
in
the
next
room
had
lit  dark
lantern  heard  gentle
sound
of
movement
and
then
all
was
silent
once
more
though
the
smell
grew
stronger
for
half
an
hour  sat
with
straining
ears
then
suddenly
another
sound
became
audible  very
gentle
soothing
sound
like
that
of  small
jet
of
steam
escaping
continually
from  kettle
the
instant
that
we
heard
it
holmes
sprang
from
the
bed
struck  match
and
lashed
furiously
with
his
cane
at
the
bell
pull
you
see
it
watson
he
yelled
you
see
it
but  saw
nothing
at
the
moment
when
holmes
struck
the
light  heard  low
clear
whistle
but
the
sudden
glare
flashing
into
my
weary
eyes
made
it
impossible
for
me
to
tell
what
it
was
at
which
my
friend
lashed
so
savagely  could
however
see
that
his
face
was
deadly
pale
and
filled
with
horror
and
loathing
he
had
ceased
to
strike
and
was
gazing
up
at
the
ventilator
when
suddenly
there
broke
from
the
silence
of
the
night
the
most
horrible
cry
to
which  have
ever
listened
it
swelled
up
louder
and
louder  hoarse
yell
of
pain
and
fear
and
anger
all
mingled
in
the
one
dreadful
shriek
they
say
that
away
down
in
the
village
and
even
in
the
distant
parsonage
that
cry
raised
the
sleepers
from
their
beds
it
struck
cold
to
our
hearts
and  stood
gazing
at
holmes
and
he
at
me
until
the
last
echoes
of
it
had
died
away
into
the
silence
from
which
it
rose
what
can
it
mean  gasped
it
means
that
it
is
all
over
holmes
answered
and
perhaps
after
all
it
is
for
the
best
take
your
pistol
and
we
will
enter
dr
roylott  room
with  grave
face
he
lit
the
lamp
and
led
the
way
down
the
corridor
twice
he
struck
at
the
chamber
door
without
any
reply
from
within
then
he
turned
the
handle
and
entered  at
his
heels
with
the
cocked
pistol
in
my
hand
it
was  singular
sight
which
met
our
eyes
on
the
table
stood  dark
lantern
with
the
shutter
half
open
throwing  brilliant
beam
of
light
upon
the
iron
safe
the
door
of
which
was
ajar
beside
this
table
on
the
wooden
chair
sat
dr
grimesby
roylott
clad
in  long
grey
dressing
gown
his
bare
ankles
protruding
beneath
and
his
feet
thrust
into
red
heelless
turkish
slippers
across
his
lap
lay
the
short
stock
with
the
long
lash
which
we
had
noticed
during
the
day
his
chin
was
cocked
upward
and
his
eyes
were
fixed
in  dreadful
rigid
stare
at
the
corner
of
the
ceiling
round
his
brow
he
had  peculiar
yellow
band
with
brownish
speckles
which
seemed
to
be
bound
tightly
round
his
head
as
we
entered
he
made
neither
sound
nor
motion
the
band
the
speckled
band
whispered
holmes  took  step
forward
in
an
instant
his
strange
headgear
began
to
move
and
there
reared
itself
from
among
his
hair
the
squat
diamond
shaped
head
and
puffed
neck
of  loathsome
serpent
it
is  swamp
adder
cried
holmes
the
deadliest
snake
in
india
he
has
died
within
ten
seconds
of
being
bitten
violence
does
in
truth
recoil
upon
the
violent
and
the
schemer
falls
into
the
pit
which
he
digs
for
another
let
us
thrust
this
creature
back
into
its
den
and
we
can
then
remove
miss
stoner
to
some
place
of
shelter
and
let
the
county
police
know
what
has
happened
as
he
spoke
he
drew
the
dog
whip
swiftly
from
the
dead
man  lap
and
throwing
the
noose
round
the
reptile  neck
he
drew
it
from
its
horrid
perch
and
carrying
it
at
arm  length
threw
it
into
the
iron
safe
which
he
closed
upon
it
such
are
the
true
facts
of
the
death
of
dr
grimesby
roylott
of
stoke
moran
it
is
not
necessary
that  should
prolong  narrative
which
has
already
run
to
too
great  length
by
telling
how
we
broke
the
sad
news
to
the
terrified
girl
how
we
conveyed
her
by
the
morning
train
to
the
care
of
her
good
aunt
at
harrow
of
how
the
slow
process
of
official
inquiry
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
doctor
met
his
fate
while
indiscreetly
playing
with  dangerous
pet
the
little
which  had
yet
to
learn
of
the
case
was
told
me
by
sherlock
holmes
as
we
travelled
back
next
day  had
said
he
come
to
an
entirely
erroneous
conclusion
which
shows
my
dear
watson
how
dangerous
it
always
is
to
reason
from
insufficient
data
the
presence
of
the
gipsies
and
the
use
of
the
word
band
which
was
used
by
the
poor
girl
no
doubt
to
explain
the
appearance
which
she
had
caught  hurried
glimpse
of
by
the
light
of
her
match
were
sufficient
to
put
me
upon
an
entirely
wrong
scent  can
only
claim
the
merit
that  instantly
reconsidered
my
position
when
however
it
became
clear
to
me
that
whatever
danger
threatened
an
occupant
of
the
room
could
not
come
either
from
the
window
or
the
door
my
attention
was
speedily
drawn
as  have
already
remarked
to
you
to
this
ventilator
and
to
the
bell
rope
which
hung
down
to
the
bed
the
discovery
that
this
was  dummy
and
that
the
bed
was
clamped
to
the
floor
instantly
gave
rise
to
the
suspicion
that
the
rope
was
there
as  bridge
for
something
passing
through
the
hole
and
coming
to
the
bed
the
idea
of  snake
instantly
occurred
to
me
and
when  coupled
it
with
my
knowledge
that
the
doctor
was
furnished
with  supply
of
creatures
from
india  felt
that  was
probably
on
the
right
track
the
idea
of
using  form
of
poison
which
could
not
possibly
be
discovered
by
any
chemical
test
was
just
such  one
as
would
occur
to  clever
and
ruthless
man
who
had
had
an
eastern
training
the
rapidity
with
which
such  poison
would
take
effect
would
also
from
his
point
of
view
be
an
advantage
it
would
be  sharp
eyed
coroner
indeed
who
could
distinguish
the
two
little
dark
punctures
which
would
show
where
the
poison
fangs
had
done
their
work
then  thought
of
the
whistle
of
course
he
must
recall
the
snake
before
the
morning
light
revealed
it
to
the
victim
he
had
trained
it
probably
by
the
use
of
the
milk
which
we
saw
to
return
to
him
when
summoned
he
would
put
it
through
this
ventilator
at
the
hour
that
he
thought
best
with
the
certainty
that
it
would
crawl
down
the
rope
and
land
on
the
bed
it
might
or
might
not
bite
the
occupant
perhaps
she
might
escape
every
night
for  week
but
sooner
or
later
she
must
fall  victim  had
come
to
these
conclusions
before
ever  had
entered
his
room
an
inspection
of
his
chair
showed
me
that
he
had
been
in
the
habit
of
standing
on
it
which
of
course
would
be
necessary
in
order
that
he
should
reach
the
ventilator
the
sight
of
the
safe
the
saucer
of
milk
and
the
loop
of
whipcord
were
enough
to
finally
dispel
any
doubts
which
may
have
remained
the
metallic
clang
heard
by
miss
stoner
was
obviously
caused
by
her
stepfather
hastily
closing
the
door
of
his
safe
upon
its
terrible
occupant
having
once
made
up
my
mind
you
know
the
steps
which  took
in
order
to
put
the
matter
to
the
proof  heard
the
creature
hiss
as  have
no
doubt
that
you
did
also
and  instantly
lit
the
light
and
attacked
it
with
the
result
of
driving
it
through
the
ventilator
and
also
with
the
result
of
causing
it
to
turn
upon
its
master
at
the
other
side
some
of
the
blows
of
my
cane
came
home
and
roused
its
snakish
temper
so
that
it
flew
upon
the
first
person
it
saw
in
this
way  am
no
doubt
indirectly
responsible
for
dr
grimesby
roylott  death
and  cannot
say
that
it
is
likely
to
weigh
very
heavily
upon
my
conscience
ix
the
adventure
of
the
engineer  thumb
of
all
the
problems
which
have
been
submitted
to
my
friend
mr
sherlock
holmes
for
solution
during
the
years
of
our
intimacy
there
were
only
two
which  was
the
means
of
introducing
to
his
notice
that
of
mr
hatherley  thumb
and
that
of
colonel
warburton  madness
of
these
the
latter
may
have
afforded  finer
field
for
an
acute
and
original
observer
but
the
other
was
so
strange
in
its
inception
and
so
dramatic
in
its
details
that
it
may
be
the
more
worthy
of
being
placed
upon
record
even
if
it
gave
my
friend
fewer
openings
for
those
deductive
methods
of
reasoning
by
which
he
achieved
such
remarkable
results
the
story
has  believe
been
told
more
than
once
in
the
newspapers
but
like
all
such
narratives
its
effect
is
much
less
striking
when
set
forth
en
bloc
in  single
half
column
of
print
than
when
the
facts
slowly
evolve
before
your
own
eyes
and
the
mystery
clears
gradually
away
as
each
new
discovery
furnishes  step
which
leads
on
to
the
complete
truth
at
the
time
the
circumstances
made  deep
impression
upon
me
and
the
lapse
of
two
years
has
hardly
served
to
weaken
the
effect
it
was
in
the
summer
of
not
long
after
my
marriage
that
the
events
occurred
which  am
now
about
to
summarise  had
returned
to
civil
practice
and
had
finally
abandoned
holmes
in
his
baker
street
rooms
although  continually
visited
him
and
occasionally
even
persuaded
him
to
forgo
his
bohemian
habits
so
far
as
to
come
and
visit
us
my
practice
had
steadily
increased
and
as  happened
to
live
at
no
very
great
distance
from
paddington
station  got  few
patients
from
among
the
officials
one
of
these
whom  had
cured
of  painful
and
lingering
disease
was
never
weary
of
advertising
my
virtues
and
of
endeavouring
to
send
me
on
every
sufferer
over
whom
he
might
have
any
influence
one
morning
at  little
before
seven  clock  was
awakened
by
the
maid
tapping
at
the
door
to
announce
that
two
men
had
come
from
paddington
and
were
waiting
in
the
consulting
room  dressed
hurriedly
for  knew
by
experience
that
railway
cases
were
seldom
trivial
and
hastened
downstairs
as  descended
my
old
ally
the
guard
came
out
of
the
room
and
closed
the
door
tightly
behind
him  ve
got
him
here
he
whispered
jerking
his
thumb
over
his
shoulder
he  all
right
what
is
it
then  asked
for
his
manner
suggested
that
it
was
some
strange
creature
which
he
had
caged
up
in
my
room
it  a
new
patient
he
whispered  thought  d
bring
him
round
myself
then
he
couldn  slip
away
there
he
is
all
safe
and
sound  must
go
now
doctor  have
my
dooties
just
the
same
as
you
and
off
he
went
this
trusty
tout
without
even
giving
me
time
to
thank
him  entered
my
consulting
room
and
found  gentleman
seated
by
the
table
he
was
quietly
dressed
in  suit
of
heather
tweed
with  soft
cloth
cap
which
he
had
laid
down
upon
my
books
round
one
of
his
hands
he
had  handkerchief
wrapped
which
was
mottled
all
over
with
bloodstains
he
was
young
not
more
than
five
and
twenty  should
say
with  strong
masculine
face
but
he
was
exceedingly
pale
and
gave
me
the
impression
of  man
who
was
suffering
from
some
strong
agitation
which
it
took
all
his
strength
of
mind
to
control  am
sorry
to
knock
you
up
so
early
doctor
said
he
but  have
had  very
serious
accident
during
the
night  came
in
by
train
this
morning
and
on
inquiring
at
paddington
as
to
where  might
find  doctor  worthy
fellow
very
kindly
escorted
me
here  gave
the
maid  card
but  see
that
she
has
left
it
upon
the
side
table  took
it
up
and
glanced
at
it
mr
victor
hatherley
hydraulic
engineer  victoria
street
rd
floor
that
was
the
name
style
and
abode
of
my
morning
visitor  regret
that  have
kept
you
waiting
said  sitting
down
in
my
library
chair
you
are
fresh
from  night
journey  understand
which
is
in
itself  monotonous
occupation
oh
my
night
could
not
be
called
monotonous
said
he
and
laughed
he
laughed
very
heartily
with  high
ringing
note
leaning
back
in
his
chair
and
shaking
his
sides
all
my
medical
instincts
rose
up
against
that
laugh
stop
it  cried
pull
yourself
together
and  poured
out
some
water
from  caraffe
it
was
useless
however
he
was
off
in
one
of
those
hysterical
outbursts
which
come
upon  strong
nature
when
some
great
crisis
is
over
and
gone
presently
he
came
to
himself
once
more
very
weary
and
pale
looking  have
been
making  fool
of
myself
he
gasped
not
at
all
drink
this  dashed
some
brandy
into
the
water
and
the
colour
began
to
come
back
to
his
bloodless
cheeks
that  better
said
he
and
now
doctor
perhaps
you
would
kindly
attend
to
my
thumb
or
rather
to
the
place
where
my
thumb
used
to
be
he
unwound
the
handkerchief
and
held
out
his
hand
it
gave
even
my
hardened
nerves  shudder
to
look
at
it
there
were
four
protruding
fingers
and  horrid
red
spongy
surface
where
the
thumb
should
have
been
it
had
been
hacked
or
torn
right
out
from
the
roots
good
heavens  cried
this
is  terrible
injury
it
must
have
bled
considerably
yes
it
did  fainted
when
it
was
done
and  think
that  must
have
been
senseless
for  long
time
when  came
to  found
that
it
was
still
bleeding
so  tied
one
end
of
my
handkerchief
very
tightly
round
the
wrist
and
braced
it
up
with  twig
excellent
you
should
have
been  surgeon
it
is  question
of
hydraulics
you
see
and
came
within
my
own
province
this
has
been
done
said  examining
the
wound
by  very
heavy
and
sharp
instrument  thing
like  cleaver
said
he
an
accident  presume
by
no
means
what  murderous
attack
very
murderous
indeed
you
horrify
me  sponged
the
wound
cleaned
it
dressed
it
and
finally
covered
it
over
with
cotton
wadding
and
carbolised
bandages
he
lay
back
without
wincing
though
he
bit
his
lip
from
time
to
time
how
is
that  asked
when  had
finished
capital
between
your
brandy
and
your
bandage  feel  new
man  was
very
weak
but  have
had  good
deal
to
go
through
perhaps
you
had
better
not
speak
of
the
matter
it
is
evidently
trying
to
your
nerves
oh
no
not
now  shall
have
to
tell
my
tale
to
the
police
but
between
ourselves
if
it
were
not
for
the
convincing
evidence
of
this
wound
of
mine  should
be
surprised
if
they
believed
my
statement
for
it
is  very
extraordinary
one
and  have
not
much
in
the
way
of
proof
with
which
to
back
it
up
and
even
if
they
believe
me
the
clues
which  can
give
them
are
so
vague
that
it
is  question
whether
justice
will
be
done
ha
cried  if
it
is
anything
in
the
nature
of  problem
which
you
desire
to
see
solved  should
strongly
recommend
you
to
come
to
my
friend
mr
sherlock
holmes
before
you
go
to
the
official
police
oh  have
heard
of
that
fellow
answered
my
visitor
and  should
be
very
glad
if
he
would
take
the
matter
up
though
of
course  must
use
the
official
police
as
well
would
you
give
me
an
introduction
to
him  ll
do
better  ll
take
you
round
to
him
myself  should
be
immensely
obliged
to
you
we
ll
call  cab
and
go
together
we
shall
just
be
in
time
to
have  little
breakfast
with
him
do
you
feel
equal
to
it
yes  shall
not
feel
easy
until  have
told
my
story
then
my
servant
will
call  cab
and  shall
be
with
you
in
an
instant  rushed
upstairs
explained
the
matter
shortly
to
my
wife
and
in
five
minutes
was
inside  hansom
driving
with
my
new
acquaintance
to
baker
street
sherlock
holmes
was
as  expected
lounging
about
his
sitting
room
in
his
dressing
gown
reading
the
agony
column
of
the
times
and
smoking
his
before
breakfast
pipe
which
was
composed
of
all
the
plugs
and
dottles
left
from
his
smokes
of
the
day
before
all
carefully
dried
and
collected
on
the
corner
of
the
mantelpiece
he
received
us
in
his
quietly
genial
fashion
ordered
fresh
rashers
and
eggs
and
joined
us
in  hearty
meal
when
it
was
concluded
he
settled
our
new
acquaintance
upon
the
sofa
placed  pillow
beneath
his
head
and
laid  glass
of
brandy
and
water
within
his
reach
it
is
easy
to
see
that
your
experience
has
been
no
common
one
mr
hatherley
said
he
pray
lie
down
there
and
make
yourself
absolutely
at
home
tell
us
what
you
can
but
stop
when
you
are
tired
and
keep
up
your
strength
with  little
stimulant
thank
you
said
my
patient
but  have
felt
another
man
since
the
doctor
bandaged
me
and  think
that
your
breakfast
has
completed
the
cure  shall
take
up
as
little
of
your
valuable
time
as
possible
so  shall
start
at
once
upon
my
peculiar
experiences
holmes
sat
in
his
big
armchair
with
the
weary
heavy
lidded
expression
which
veiled
his
keen
and
eager
nature
while  sat
opposite
to
him
and
we
listened
in
silence
to
the
strange
story
which
our
visitor
detailed
to
us
you
must
know
said
he
that  am
an
orphan
and  bachelor
residing
alone
in
lodgings
in
london
by
profession  am  hydraulic
engineer
and  have
had
considerable
experience
of
my
work
during
the
seven
years
that  was
apprenticed
to
venner
matheson
the
well
known
firm
of
greenwich
two
years
ago
having
served
my
time
and
having
also
come
into  fair
sum
of
money
through
my
poor
father  death  determined
to
start
in
business
for
myself
and
took
professional
chambers
in
victoria
street  suppose
that
everyone
finds
his
first
independent
start
in
business  dreary
experience
to
me
it
has
been
exceptionally
so
during
two
years  have
had
three
consultations
and
one
small
job
and
that
is
absolutely
all
that
my
profession
has
brought
me
my
gross
takings
amount
to  every
day
from
nine
in
the
morning
until
four
in
the
afternoon  waited
in
my
little
den
until
at
last
my
heart
began
to
sink
and  came
to
believe
that  should
never
have
any
practice
at
all
yesterday
however
just
as  was
thinking
of
leaving
the
office
my
clerk
entered
to
say
there
was  gentleman
waiting
who
wished
to
see
me
upon
business
he
brought
up  card
too
with
the
name
of
colonel
lysander
stark
engraved
upon
it
close
at
his
heels
came
the
colonel
himself  man
rather
over
the
middle
size
but
of
an
exceeding
thinness  do
not
think
that  have
ever
seen
so
thin  man
his
whole
face
sharpened
away
into
nose
and
chin
and
the
skin
of
his
cheeks
was
drawn
quite
tense
over
his
outstanding
bones
yet
this
emaciation
seemed
to
be
his
natural
habit
and
due
to
no
disease
for
his
eye
was
bright
his
step
brisk
and
his
bearing
assured
he
was
plainly
but
neatly
dressed
and
his
age  should
judge
would
be
nearer
forty
than
thirty
mr
hatherley
said
he
with
something
of  german
accent
you
have
been
recommended
to
me
mr
hatherley
as
being  man
who
is
not
only
proficient
in
his
profession
but
is
also
discreet
and
capable
of
preserving  secret  bowed
feeling
as
flattered
as
any
young
man
would
at
such
an
address
may  ask
who
it
was
who
gave
me
so
good  character
well
perhaps
it
is
better
that  should
not
tell
you
that
just
at
this
moment  have
it
from
the
same
source
that
you
are
both
an
orphan
and  bachelor
and
are
residing
alone
in
london
that
is
quite
correct  answered
but
you
will
excuse
me
if  say
that  cannot
see
how
all
this
bears
upon
my
professional
qualifications  understand
that
it
was
on  professional
matter
that
you
wished
to
speak
to
me
undoubtedly
so
but
you
will
find
that
all  say
is
really
to
the
point  have  professional
commission
for
you
but
absolute
secrecy
is
quite
essential
absolute
secrecy
you
understand
and
of
course
we
may
expect
that
more
from  man
who
is
alone
than
from
one
who
lives
in
the
bosom
of
his
family
if  promise
to
keep  secret
said  you
may
absolutely
depend
upon
my
doing
so
he
looked
very
hard
at
me
as  spoke
and
it
seemed
to
me
that  had
never
seen
so
suspicious
and
questioning
an
eye
do
you
promise
then
said
he
at
last
yes  promise
absolute
and
complete
silence
before
during
and
after
no
reference
to
the
matter
at
all
either
in
word
or
writing  have
already
given
you
my
word
very
good
he
suddenly
sprang
up
and
darting
like
lightning
across
the
room
he
flung
open
the
door
the
passage
outside
was
empty
that  all
right
said
he
coming
back  know
that
clerks
are
sometimes
curious
as
to
their
master  affairs
now
we
can
talk
in
safety
he
drew
up
his
chair
very
close
to
mine
and
began
to
stare
at
me
again
with
the
same
questioning
and
thoughtful
look  feeling
of
repulsion
and
of
something
akin
to
fear
had
begun
to
rise
within
me
at
the
strange
antics
of
this
fleshless
man
even
my
dread
of
losing  client
could
not
restrain
me
from
showing
my
impatience  beg
that
you
will
state
your
business
sir
said  my
time
is
of
value
heaven
forgive
me
for
that
last
sentence
but
the
words
came
to
my
lips
how
would
fifty
guineas
for  night  work
suit
you
he
asked
most
admirably  say  night  work
but
an
hour  would
be
nearer
the
mark  simply
want
your
opinion
about  hydraulic
stamping
machine
which
has
got
out
of
gear
if
you
show
us
what
is
wrong
we
shall
soon
set
it
right
ourselves
what
do
you
think
of
such  commission
as
that
the
work
appears
to
be
light
and
the
pay
munificent
precisely
so
we
shall
want
you
to
come
to
night
by
the
last
train
where
to
to
eyford
in
berkshire
it
is  little
place
near
the
borders
of
oxfordshire
and
within
seven
miles
of
reading
there
is  train
from
paddington
which
would
bring
you
there
at
about
very
good  shall
come
down
in  carriage
to
meet
you
there
is  drive
then
yes
our
little
place
is
quite
out
in
the
country
it
is  good
seven
miles
from
eyford
station
then
we
can
hardly
get
there
before
midnight  suppose
there
would
be
no
chance
of  train
back  should
be
compelled
to
stop
the
night
yes
we
could
easily
give
you  shake
down
that
is
very
awkward
could  not
come
at
some
more
convenient
hour
we
have
judged
it
best
that
you
should
come
late
it
is
to
recompense
you
for
any
inconvenience
that
we
are
paying
to
you  young
and
unknown
man  fee
which
would
buy
an
opinion
from
the
very
heads
of
your
profession
still
of
course
if
you
would
like
to
draw
out
of
the
business
there
is
plenty
of
time
to
do
so  thought
of
the
fifty
guineas
and
of
how
very
useful
they
would
be
to
me
not
at
all
said  i
shall
be
very
happy
to
accommodate
myself
to
your
wishes  should
like
however
to
understand  little
more
clearly
what
it
is
that
you
wish
me
to
do
quite
so
it
is
very
natural
that
the
pledge
of
secrecy
which
we
have
exacted
from
you
should
have
aroused
your
curiosity  have
no
wish
to
commit
you
to
anything
without
your
having
it
all
laid
before
you  suppose
that
we
are
absolutely
safe
from
eavesdroppers
entirely
then
the
matter
stands
thus
you
are
probably
aware
that
fuller  earth
is  valuable
product
and
that
it
is
only
found
in
one
or
two
places
in
england  have
heard
so
some
little
time
ago  bought  small
place  very
small
place
within
ten
miles
of
reading  was
fortunate
enough
to
discover
that
there
was  deposit
of
fuller  earth
in
one
of
my
fields
on
examining
it
however  found
that
this
deposit
was  comparatively
small
one
and
that
it
formed  link
between
two
very
much
larger
ones
upon
the
right
and
left
both
of
them
however
in
the
grounds
of
my
neighbours
these
good
people
were
absolutely
ignorant
that
their
land
contained
that
which
was
quite
as
valuable
as  gold
mine
naturally
it
was
to
my
interest
to
buy
their
land
before
they
discovered
its
true
value
but
unfortunately  had
no
capital
by
which  could
do
this  took  few
of
my
friends
into
the
secret
however
and
they
suggested
that
we
should
quietly
and
secretly
work
our
own
little
deposit
and
that
in
this
way
we
should
earn
the
money
which
would
enable
us
to
buy
the
neighbouring
fields
this
we
have
now
been
doing
for
some
time
and
in
order
to
help
us
in
our
operations
we
erected  hydraulic
press
this
press
as  have
already
explained
has
got
out
of
order
and
we
wish
your
advice
upon
the
subject
we
guard
our
secret
very
jealously
however
and
if
it
once
became
known
that
we
had
hydraulic
engineers
coming
to
our
little
house
it
would
soon
rouse
inquiry
and
then
if
the
facts
came
out
it
would
be
good
bye
to
any
chance
of
getting
these
fields
and
carrying
out
our
plans
that
is
why  have
made
you
promise
me
that
you
will
not
tell  human
being
that
you
are
going
to
eyford
to
night  hope
that  make
it
all
plain  quite
follow
you
said  the
only
point
which  could
not
quite
understand
was
what
use
you
could
make
of  hydraulic
press
in
excavating
fuller  earth
which
as  understand
is
dug
out
like
gravel
from  pit
ah
said
he
carelessly
we
have
our
own
process
we
compress
the
earth
into
bricks
so
as
to
remove
them
without
revealing
what
they
are
but
that
is  mere
detail  have
taken
you
fully
into
my
confidence
now
mr
hatherley
and  have
shown
you
how  trust
you
he
rose
as
he
spoke  shall
expect
you
then
at
eyford
at  shall
certainly
be
there
and
not  word
to  soul
he
looked
at
me
with  last
long
questioning
gaze
and
then
pressing
my
hand
in  cold
dank
grasp
he
hurried
from
the
room
well
when  came
to
think
it
all
over
in
cool
blood  was
very
much
astonished
as
you
may
both
think
at
this
sudden
commission
which
had
been
intrusted
to
me
on
the
one
hand
of
course  was
glad
for
the
fee
was
at
least
tenfold
what  should
have
asked
had  set  price
upon
my
own
services
and
it
was
possible
that
this
order
might
lead
to
other
ones
on
the
other
hand
the
face
and
manner
of
my
patron
had
made
an
unpleasant
impression
upon
me
and  could
not
think
that
his
explanation
of
the
fuller  earth
was
sufficient
to
explain
the
necessity
for
my
coming
at
midnight
and
his
extreme
anxiety
lest  should
tell
anyone
of
my
errand
however  threw
all
fears
to
the
winds
ate  hearty
supper
drove
to
paddington
and
started
off
having
obeyed
to
the
letter
the
injunction
as
to
holding
my
tongue
at
reading  had
to
change
not
only
my
carriage
but
my
station
however  was
in
time
for
the
last
train
to
eyford
and  reached
the
little
dim
lit
station
after
eleven  clock  was
the
only
passenger
who
got
out
there
and
there
was
no
one
upon
the
platform
save  single
sleepy
porter
with  lantern
as  passed
out
through
the
wicket
gate
however  found
my
acquaintance
of
the
morning
waiting
in
the
shadow
upon
the
other
side
without  word
he
grasped
my
arm
and
hurried
me
into  carriage
the
door
of
which
was
standing
open
he
drew
up
the
windows
on
either
side
tapped
on
the
wood
work
and
away
we
went
as
fast
as
the
horse
could
go
one
horse
interjected
holmes
yes
only
one
did
you
observe
the
colour
yes  saw
it
by
the
side
lights
when  was
stepping
into
the
carriage
it
was  chestnut
tired
looking
or
fresh
oh
fresh
and
glossy
thank
you  am
sorry
to
have
interrupted
you
pray
continue
your
most
interesting
statement
away
we
went
then
and
we
drove
for
at
least
an
hour
colonel
lysander
stark
had
said
that
it
was
only
seven
miles
but  should
think
from
the
rate
that
we
seemed
to
go
and
from
the
time
that
we
took
that
it
must
have
been
nearer
twelve
he
sat
at
my
side
in
silence
all
the
time
and  was
aware
more
than
once
when  glanced
in
his
direction
that
he
was
looking
at
me
with
great
intensity
the
country
roads
seem
to
be
not
very
good
in
that
part
of
the
world
for
we
lurched
and
jolted
terribly  tried
to
look
out
of
the
windows
to
see
something
of
where
we
were
but
they
were
made
of
frosted
glass
and  could
make
out
nothing
save
the
occasional
bright
blur
of  passing
light
now
and
then  hazarded
some
remark
to
break
the
monotony
of
the
journey
but
the
colonel
answered
only
in
monosyllables
and
the
conversation
soon
flagged
at
last
however
the
bumping
of
the
road
was
exchanged
for
the
crisp
smoothness
of  gravel
drive
and
the
carriage
came
to  stand
colonel
lysander
stark
sprang
out
and
as  followed
after
him
pulled
me
swiftly
into  porch
which
gaped
in
front
of
us
we
stepped
as
it
were
right
out
of
the
carriage
and
into
the
hall
so
that  failed
to
catch
the
most
fleeting
glance
of
the
front
of
the
house
the
instant
that  had
crossed
the
threshold
the
door
slammed
heavily
behind
us
and  heard
faintly
the
rattle
of
the
wheels
as
the
carriage
drove
away
it
was
pitch
dark
inside
the
house
and
the
colonel
fumbled
about
looking
for
matches
and
muttering
under
his
breath
suddenly  door
opened
at
the
other
end
of
the
passage
and  long
golden
bar
of
light
shot
out
in
our
direction
it
grew
broader
and  woman
appeared
with  lamp
in
her
hand
which
she
held
above
her
head
pushing
her
face
forward
and
peering
at
us  could
see
that
she
was
pretty
and
from
the
gloss
with
which
the
light
shone
upon
her
dark
dress  knew
that
it
was  rich
material
she
spoke  few
words
in  foreign
tongue
in  tone
as
though
asking  question
and
when
my
companion
answered
in  gruff
monosyllable
she
gave
such  start
that
the
lamp
nearly
fell
from
her
hand
colonel
stark
went
up
to
her
whispered
something
in
her
ear
and
then
pushing
her
back
into
the
room
from
whence
she
had
come
he
walked
towards
me
again
with
the
lamp
in
his
hand
perhaps
you
will
have
the
kindness
to
wait
in
this
room
for  few
minutes
said
he
throwing
open
another
door
it
was  quiet
little
plainly
furnished
room
with  round
table
in
the
centre
on
which
several
german
books
were
scattered
colonel
stark
laid
down
the
lamp
on
the
top
of  harmonium
beside
the
door  shall
not
keep
you
waiting
an
instant
said
he
and
vanished
into
the
darkness  glanced
at
the
books
upon
the
table
and
in
spite
of
my
ignorance
of
german  could
see
that
two
of
them
were
treatises
on
science
the
others
being
volumes
of
poetry
then  walked
across
to
the
window
hoping
that  might
catch
some
glimpse
of
the
country
side
but
an
oak
shutter
heavily
barred
was
folded
across
it
it
was  wonderfully
silent
house
there
was
an
old
clock
ticking
loudly
somewhere
in
the
passage
but
otherwise
everything
was
deadly
still  vague
feeling
of
uneasiness
began
to
steal
over
me
who
were
these
german
people
and
what
were
they
doing
living
in
this
strange
out
of
the
way
place
and
where
was
the
place  was
ten
miles
or
so
from
eyford
that
was
all  knew
but
whether
north
south
east
or
west  had
no
idea
for
that
matter
reading
and
possibly
other
large
towns
were
within
that
radius
so
the
place
might
not
be
so
secluded
after
all
yet
it
was
quite
certain
from
the
absolute
stillness
that
we
were
in
the
country  paced
up
and
down
the
room
humming  tune
under
my
breath
to
keep
up
my
spirits
and
feeling
that  was
thoroughly
earning
my
fifty
guinea
fee
suddenly
without
any
preliminary
sound
in
the
midst
of
the
utter
stillness
the
door
of
my
room
swung
slowly
open
the
woman
was
standing
in
the
aperture
the
darkness
of
the
hall
behind
her
the
yellow
light
from
my
lamp
beating
upon
her
eager
and
beautiful
face  could
see
at  glance
that
she
was
sick
with
fear
and
the
sight
sent  chill
to
my
own
heart
she
held
up
one
shaking
finger
to
warn
me
to
be
silent
and
she
shot  few
whispered
words
of
broken
english
at
me
her
eyes
glancing
back
like
those
of  frightened
horse
into
the
gloom
behind
her  would
go
said
she
trying
hard
as
it
seemed
to
me
to
speak
calmly  would
go  should
not
stay
here
there
is
no
good
for
you
to
do
but
madam
said  i
have
not
yet
done
what  came
for  cannot
possibly
leave
until  have
seen
the
machine
it
is
not
worth
your
while
to
wait
she
went
on
you
can
pass
through
the
door
no
one
hinders
and
then
seeing
that  smiled
and
shook
my
head
she
suddenly
threw
aside
her
constraint
and
made  step
forward
with
her
hands
wrung
together
for
the
love
of
heaven
she
whispered
get
away
from
here
before
it
is
too
late
but  am
somewhat
headstrong
by
nature
and
the
more
ready
to
engage
in
an
affair
when
there
is
some
obstacle
in
the
way  thought
of
my
fifty
guinea
fee
of
my
wearisome
journey
and
of
the
unpleasant
night
which
seemed
to
be
before
me
was
it
all
to
go
for
nothing
why
should  slink
away
without
having
carried
out
my
commission
and
without
the
payment
which
was
my
due
this
woman
might
for
all  knew
be  monomaniac
with  stout
bearing
therefore
though
her
manner
had
shaken
me
more
than  cared
to
confess  still
shook
my
head
and
declared
my
intention
of
remaining
where  was
she
was
about
to
renew
her
entreaties
when  door
slammed
overhead
and
the
sound
of
several
footsteps
was
heard
upon
the
stairs
she
listened
for
an
instant
threw
up
her
hands
with  despairing
gesture
and
vanished
as
suddenly
and
as
noiselessly
as
she
had
come
the
newcomers
were
colonel
lysander
stark
and  short
thick
man
with  chinchilla
beard
growing
out
of
the
creases
of
his
double
chin
who
was
introduced
to
me
as
mr
ferguson
this
is
my
secretary
and
manager
said
the
colonel
by
the
way  was
under
the
impression
that  left
this
door
shut
just
now  fear
that
you
have
felt
the
draught
on
the
contrary
said  i
opened
the
door
myself
because  felt
the
room
to
be  little
close
he
shot
one
of
his
suspicious
looks
at
me
perhaps
we
had
better
proceed
to
business
then
said
he
mr
ferguson
and  will
take
you
up
to
see
the
machine  had
better
put
my
hat
on  suppose
oh
no
it
is
in
the
house
what
you
dig
fuller  earth
in
the
house
no
no
this
is
only
where
we
compress
it
but
never
mind
that
all
we
wish
you
to
do
is
to
examine
the
machine
and
to
let
us
know
what
is
wrong
with
it
we
went
upstairs
together
the
colonel
first
with
the
lamp
the
fat
manager
and  behind
him
it
was  labyrinth
of
an
old
house
with
corridors
passages
narrow
winding
staircases
and
little
low
doors
the
thresholds
of
which
were
hollowed
out
by
the
generations
who
had
crossed
them
there
were
no
carpets
and
no
signs
of
any
furniture
above
the
ground
floor
while
the
plaster
was
peeling
off
the
walls
and
the
damp
was
breaking
through
in
green
unhealthy
blotches  tried
to
put
on
as
unconcerned
an
air
as
possible
but  had
not
forgotten
the
warnings
of
the
lady
even
though  disregarded
them
and  kept  keen
eye
upon
my
two
companions
ferguson
appeared
to
be  morose
and
silent
man
but  could
see
from
the
little
that
he
said
that
he
was
at
least  fellow
countryman
colonel
lysander
stark
stopped
at
last
before  low
door
which
he
unlocked
within
was  small
square
room
in
which
the
three
of
us
could
hardly
get
at
one
time
ferguson
remained
outside
and
the
colonel
ushered
me
in
we
are
now
said
he
actually
within
the
hydraulic
press
and
it
would
be  particularly
unpleasant
thing
for
us
if
anyone
were
to
turn
it
on
the
ceiling
of
this
small
chamber
is
really
the
end
of
the
descending
piston
and
it
comes
down
with
the
force
of
many
tons
upon
this
metal
floor
there
are
small
lateral
columns
of
water
outside
which
receive
the
force
and
which
transmit
and
multiply
it
in
the
manner
which
is
familiar
to
you
the
machine
goes
readily
enough
but
there
is
some
stiffness
in
the
working
of
it
and
it
has
lost  little
of
its
force
perhaps
you
will
have
the
goodness
to
look
it
over
and
to
show
us
how
we
can
set
it
right  took
the
lamp
from
him
and  examined
the
machine
very
thoroughly
it
was
indeed  gigantic
one
and
capable
of
exercising
enormous
pressure
when  passed
outside
however
and
pressed
down
the
levers
which
controlled
it  knew
at
once
by
the
whishing
sound
that
there
was  slight
leakage
which
allowed  regurgitation
of
water
through
one
of
the
side
cylinders
an
examination
showed
that
one
of
the
india
rubber
bands
which
was
round
the
head
of  driving
rod
had
shrunk
so
as
not
quite
to
fill
the
socket
along
which
it
worked
this
was
clearly
the
cause
of
the
loss
of
power
and  pointed
it
out
to
my
companions
who
followed
my
remarks
very
carefully
and
asked
several
practical
questions
as
to
how
they
should
proceed
to
set
it
right
when  had
made
it
clear
to
them  returned
to
the
main
chamber
of
the
machine
and
took  good
look
at
it
to
satisfy
my
own
curiosity
it
was
obvious
at  glance
that
the
story
of
the
fuller  earth
was
the
merest
fabrication
for
it
would
be
absurd
to
suppose
that
so
powerful
an
engine
could
be
designed
for
so
inadequate  purpose
the
walls
were
of
wood
but
the
floor
consisted
of  large
iron
trough
and
when  came
to
examine
it  could
see  crust
of
metallic
deposit
all
over
it  had
stooped
and
was
scraping
at
this
to
see
exactly
what
it
was
when  heard  muttered
exclamation
in
german
and
saw
the
cadaverous
face
of
the
colonel
looking
down
at
me
what
are
you
doing
there
he
asked  felt
angry
at
having
been
tricked
by
so
elaborate  story
as
that
which
he
had
told
me  was
admiring
your
fuller  earth
said  i
think
that  should
be
better
able
to
advise
you
as
to
your
machine
if  knew
what
the
exact
purpose
was
for
which
it
was
used
the
instant
that  uttered
the
words  regretted
the
rashness
of
my
speech
his
face
set
hard
and  baleful
light
sprang
up
in
his
grey
eyes
very
well
said
he
you
shall
know
all
about
the
machine
he
took  step
backward
slammed
the
little
door
and
turned
the
key
in
the
lock  rushed
towards
it
and
pulled
at
the
handle
but
it
was
quite
secure
and
did
not
give
in
the
least
to
my
kicks
and
shoves
hullo  yelled
hullo
colonel
let
me
out
and
then
suddenly
in
the
silence  heard  sound
which
sent
my
heart
into
my
mouth
it
was
the
clank
of
the
levers
and
the
swish
of
the
leaking
cylinder
he
had
set
the
engine
at
work
the
lamp
still
stood
upon
the
floor
where  had
placed
it
when
examining
the
trough
by
its
light  saw
that
the
black
ceiling
was
coming
down
upon
me
slowly
jerkily
but
as
none
knew
better
than
myself
with  force
which
must
within  minute
grind
me
to  shapeless
pulp  threw
myself
screaming
against
the
door
and
dragged
with
my
nails
at
the
lock  implored
the
colonel
to
let
me
out
but
the
remorseless
clanking
of
the
levers
drowned
my
cries
the
ceiling
was
only  foot
or
two
above
my
head
and
with
my
hand
upraised  could
feel
its
hard
rough
surface
then
it
flashed
through
my
mind
that
the
pain
of
my
death
would
depend
very
much
upon
the
position
in
which  met
it
if  lay
on
my
face
the
weight
would
come
upon
my
spine
and  shuddered
to
think
of
that
dreadful
snap
easier
the
other
way
perhaps
and
yet
had  the
nerve
to
lie
and
look
up
at
that
deadly
black
shadow
wavering
down
upon
me
already  was
unable
to
stand
erect
when
my
eye
caught
something
which
brought  gush
of
hope
back
to
my
heart  have
said
that
though
the
floor
and
ceiling
were
of
iron
the
walls
were
of
wood
as  gave  last
hurried
glance
around  saw  thin
line
of
yellow
light
between
two
of
the
boards
which
broadened
and
broadened
as  small
panel
was
pushed
backward
for
an
instant  could
hardly
believe
that
here
was
indeed  door
which
led
away
from
death
the
next
instant  threw
myself
through
and
lay
half
fainting
upon
the
other
side
the
panel
had
closed
again
behind
me
but
the
crash
of
the
lamp
and  few
moments
afterwards
the
clang
of
the
two
slabs
of
metal
told
me
how
narrow
had
been
my
escape  was
recalled
to
myself
by  frantic
plucking
at
my
wrist
and  found
myself
lying
upon
the
stone
floor
of  narrow
corridor
while  woman
bent
over
me
and
tugged
at
me
with
her
left
hand
while
she
held  candle
in
her
right
it
was
the
same
good
friend
whose
warning  had
so
foolishly
rejected
come
come
she
cried
breathlessly
they
will
be
here
in  moment
they
will
see
that
you
are
not
there
oh
do
not
waste
the
so
precious
time
but
come
this
time
at
least  did
not
scorn
her
advice  staggered
to
my
feet
and
ran
with
her
along
the
corridor
and
down  winding
stair
the
latter
led
to
another
broad
passage
and
just
as
we
reached
it
we
heard
the
sound
of
running
feet
and
the
shouting
of
two
voices
one
answering
the
other
from
the
floor
on
which
we
were
and
from
the
one
beneath
my
guide
stopped
and
looked
about
her
like
one
who
is
at
her
wit  end
then
she
threw
open  door
which
led
into  bedroom
through
the
window
of
which
the
moon
was
shining
brightly
it
is
your
only
chance
said
she
it
is
high
but
it
may
be
that
you
can
jump
it
as
she
spoke  light
sprang
into
view
at
the
further
end
of
the
passage
and  saw
the
lean
figure
of
colonel
lysander
stark
rushing
forward
with  lantern
in
one
hand
and  weapon
like  butcher  cleaver
in
the
other  rushed
across
the
bedroom
flung
open
the
window
and
looked
out
how
quiet
and
sweet
and
wholesome
the
garden
looked
in
the
moonlight
and
it
could
not
be
more
than
thirty
feet
down  clambered
out
upon
the
sill
but  hesitated
to
jump
until  should
have
heard
what
passed
between
my
saviour
and
the
ruffian
who
pursued
me
if
she
were
ill
used
then
at
any
risks  was
determined
to
go
back
to
her
assistance
the
thought
had
hardly
flashed
through
my
mind
before
he
was
at
the
door
pushing
his
way
past
her
but
she
threw
her
arms
round
him
and
tried
to
hold
him
back
fritz
fritz
she
cried
in
english
remember
your
promise
after
the
last
time
you
said
it
should
not
be
again
he
will
be
silent
oh
he
will
be
silent
you
are
mad
elise
he
shouted
struggling
to
break
away
from
her
you
will
be
the
ruin
of
us
he
has
seen
too
much
let
me
pass  say
he
dashed
her
to
one
side
and
rushing
to
the
window
cut
at
me
with
his
heavy
weapon  had
let
myself
go
and
was
hanging
by
the
hands
to
the
sill
when
his
blow
fell  was
conscious
of  dull
pain
my
grip
loosened
and  fell
into
the
garden
below  was
shaken
but
not
hurt
by
the
fall
so  picked
myself
up
and
rushed
off
among
the
bushes
as
hard
as  could
run
for  understood
that  was
far
from
being
out
of
danger
yet
suddenly
however
as  ran  deadly
dizziness
and
sickness
came
over
me  glanced
down
at
my
hand
which
was
throbbing
painfully
and
then
for
the
first
time
saw
that
my
thumb
had
been
cut
off
and
that
the
blood
was
pouring
from
my
wound  endeavoured
to
tie
my
handkerchief
round
it
but
there
came  sudden
buzzing
in
my
ears
and
next
moment  fell
in  dead
faint
among
the
rose
bushes
how
long  remained
unconscious  cannot
tell
it
must
have
been  very
long
time
for
the
moon
had
sunk
and  bright
morning
was
breaking
when  came
to
myself
my
clothes
were
all
sodden
with
dew
and
my
coat
sleeve
was
drenched
with
blood
from
my
wounded
thumb
the
smarting
of
it
recalled
in
an
instant
all
the
particulars
of
my
night  adventure
and  sprang
to
my
feet
with
the
feeling
that  might
hardly
yet
be
safe
from
my
pursuers
but
to
my
astonishment
when  came
to
look
round
me
neither
house
nor
garden
were
to
be
seen  had
been
lying
in
an
angle
of
the
hedge
close
by
the
highroad
and
just  little
lower
down
was  long
building
which
proved
upon
my
approaching
it
to
be
the
very
station
at
which  had
arrived
upon
the
previous
night
were
it
not
for
the
ugly
wound
upon
my
hand
all
that
had
passed
during
those
dreadful
hours
might
have
been
an
evil
dream
half
dazed  went
into
the
station
and
asked
about
the
morning
train
there
would
be
one
to
reading
in
less
than
an
hour
the
same
porter
was
on
duty  found
as
had
been
there
when  arrived  inquired
of
him
whether
he
had
ever
heard
of
colonel
lysander
stark
the
name
was
strange
to
him
had
he
observed  carriage
the
night
before
waiting
for
me
no
he
had
not
was
there  police
station
anywhere
near
there
was
one
about
three
miles
off
it
was
too
far
for
me
to
go
weak
and
ill
as  was  determined
to
wait
until  got
back
to
town
before
telling
my
story
to
the
police
it
was  little
past
six
when  arrived
so  went
first
to
have
my
wound
dressed
and
then
the
doctor
was
kind
enough
to
bring
me
along
here  put
the
case
into
your
hands
and
shall
do
exactly
what
you
advise
we
both
sat
in
silence
for
some
little
time
after
listening
to
this
extraordinary
narrative
then
sherlock
holmes
pulled
down
from
the
shelf
one
of
the
ponderous
commonplace
books
in
which
he
placed
his
cuttings
here
is
an
advertisement
which
will
interest
you
said
he
it
appeared
in
all
the
papers
about  year
ago
listen
to
this
lost
on
the
th
inst
mr
jeremiah
hayling
aged
twenty
six  hydraulic
engineer
left
his
lodgings
at
ten  clock
at
night
and
has
not
been
heard
of
since
was
dressed
in
etc
etc
ha
that
represents
the
last
time
that
the
colonel
needed
to
have
his
machine
overhauled  fancy
good
heavens
cried
my
patient
then
that
explains
what
the
girl
said
undoubtedly
it
is
quite
clear
that
the
colonel
was  cool
and
desperate
man
who
was
absolutely
determined
that
nothing
should
stand
in
the
way
of
his
little
game
like
those
out
and
out
pirates
who
will
leave
no
survivor
from  captured
ship
well
every
moment
now
is
precious
so
if
you
feel
equal
to
it
we
shall
go
down
to
scotland
yard
at
once
as  preliminary
to
starting
for
eyford
some
three
hours
or
so
afterwards
we
were
all
in
the
train
together
bound
from
reading
to
the
little
berkshire
village
there
were
sherlock
holmes
the
hydraulic
engineer
inspector
bradstreet
of
scotland
yard  plain
clothes
man
and
myself
bradstreet
had
spread
an
ordnance
map
of
the
county
out
upon
the
seat
and
was
busy
with
his
compasses
drawing  circle
with
eyford
for
its
centre
there
you
are
said
he
that
circle
is
drawn
at  radius
of
ten
miles
from
the
village
the
place
we
want
must
be
somewhere
near
that
line
you
said
ten
miles  think
sir
it
was
an
hour  good
drive
and
you
think
that
they
brought
you
back
all
that
way
when
you
were
unconscious
they
must
have
done
so  have  confused
memory
too
of
having
been
lifted
and
conveyed
somewhere
what  cannot
understand
said  is
why
they
should
have
spared
you
when
they
found
you
lying
fainting
in
the
garden
perhaps
the
villain
was
softened
by
the
woman  entreaties  hardly
think
that
likely  never
saw  more
inexorable
face
in
my
life
oh
we
shall
soon
clear
up
all
that
said
bradstreet
well  have
drawn
my
circle
and  only
wish  knew
at
what
point
upon
it
the
folk
that
we
are
in
search
of
are
to
be
found  think  could
lay
my
finger
on
it
said
holmes
quietly
really
now
cried
the
inspector
you
have
formed
your
opinion
come
now
we
shall
see
who
agrees
with
you  say
it
is
south
for
the
country
is
more
deserted
there
and  say
east
said
my
patient  am
for
west
remarked
the
plain
clothes
man
there
are
several
quiet
little
villages
up
there
and  am
for
north
said  because
there
are
no
hills
there
and
our
friend
says
that
he
did
not
notice
the
carriage
go
up
any
come
cried
the
inspector
laughing
it  a
very
pretty
diversity
of
opinion
we
have
boxed
the
compass
among
us
who
do
you
give
your
casting
vote
to
you
are
all
wrong
but
we
can  all
be
oh
yes
you
can
this
is
my
point
he
placed
his
finger
in
the
centre
of
the
circle
this
is
where
we
shall
find
them
but
the
twelve
mile
drive
gasped
hatherley
six
out
and
six
back
nothing
simpler
you
say
yourself
that
the
horse
was
fresh
and
glossy
when
you
got
in
how
could
it
be
that
if
it
had
gone
twelve
miles
over
heavy
roads
indeed
it
is  likely
ruse
enough
observed
bradstreet
thoughtfully
of
course
there
can
be
no
doubt
as
to
the
nature
of
this
gang
none
at
all
said
holmes
they
are
coiners
on  large
scale
and
have
used
the
machine
to
form
the
amalgam
which
has
taken
the
place
of
silver
we
have
known
for
some
time
that  clever
gang
was
at
work
said
the
inspector
they
have
been
turning
out
half
crowns
by
the
thousand
we
even
traced
them
as
far
as
reading
but
could
get
no
farther
for
they
had
covered
their
traces
in  way
that
showed
that
they
were
very
old
hands
but
now
thanks
to
this
lucky
chance  think
that
we
have
got
them
right
enough
but
the
inspector
was
mistaken
for
those
criminals
were
not
destined
to
fall
into
the
hands
of
justice
as
we
rolled
into
eyford
station
we
saw  gigantic
column
of
smoke
which
streamed
up
from
behind  small
clump
of
trees
in
the
neighbourhood
and
hung
like
an
immense
ostrich
feather
over
the
landscape  house
on
fire
asked
bradstreet
as
the
train
steamed
off
again
on
its
way
yes
sir
said
the
station
master
when
did
it
break
out  hear
that
it
was
during
the
night
sir
but
it
has
got
worse
and
the
whole
place
is
in  blaze
whose
house
is
it
dr
becher  tell
me
broke
in
the
engineer
is
dr
becher  german
very
thin
with  long
sharp
nose
the
station
master
laughed
heartily
no
sir
dr
becher
is
an
englishman
and
there
isn  a
man
in
the
parish
who
has  better
lined
waistcoat
but
he
has  gentleman
staying
with
him  patient
as  understand
who
is  foreigner
and
he
looks
as
if  little
good
berkshire
beef
would
do
him
no
harm
the
station
master
had
not
finished
his
speech
before
we
were
all
hastening
in
the
direction
of
the
fire
the
road
topped  low
hill
and
there
was  great
widespread
whitewashed
building
in
front
of
us
spouting
fire
at
every
chink
and
window
while
in
the
garden
in
front
three
fire
engines
were
vainly
striving
to
keep
the
flames
under
that  it
cried
hatherley
in
intense
excitement
there
is
the
gravel
drive
and
there
are
the
rose
bushes
where  lay
that
second
window
is
the
one
that  jumped
from
well
at
least
said
holmes
you
have
had
your
revenge
upon
them
there
can
be
no
question
that
it
was
your
oil
lamp
which
when
it
was
crushed
in
the
press
set
fire
to
the
wooden
walls
though
no
doubt
they
were
too
excited
in
the
chase
after
you
to
observe
it
at
the
time
now
keep
your
eyes
open
in
this
crowd
for
your
friends
of
last
night
though  very
much
fear
that
they
are  good
hundred
miles
off
by
now
and
holmes
fears
came
to
be
realised
for
from
that
day
to
this
no
word
has
ever
been
heard
either
of
the
beautiful
woman
the
sinister
german
or
the
morose
englishman
early
that
morning  peasant
had
met  cart
containing
several
people
and
some
very
bulky
boxes
driving
rapidly
in
the
direction
of
reading
but
there
all
traces
of
the
fugitives
disappeared
and
even
holmes
ingenuity
failed
ever
to
discover
the
least
clue
as
to
their
whereabouts
the
firemen
had
been
much
perturbed
at
the
strange
arrangements
which
they
had
found
within
and
still
more
so
by
discovering  newly
severed
human
thumb
upon  window
sill
of
the
second
floor
about
sunset
however
their
efforts
were
at
last
successful
and
they
subdued
the
flames
but
not
before
the
roof
had
fallen
in
and
the
whole
place
been
reduced
to
such
absolute
ruin
that
save
some
twisted
cylinders
and
iron
piping
not  trace
remained
of
the
machinery
which
had
cost
our
unfortunate
acquaintance
so
dearly
large
masses
of
nickel
and
of
tin
were
discovered
stored
in
an
out
house
but
no
coins
were
to
be
found
which
may
have
explained
the
presence
of
those
bulky
boxes
which
have
been
already
referred
to
how
our
hydraulic
engineer
had
been
conveyed
from
the
garden
to
the
spot
where
he
recovered
his
senses
might
have
remained
forever  mystery
were
it
not
for
the
soft
mould
which
told
us  very
plain
tale
he
had
evidently
been
carried
down
by
two
persons
one
of
whom
had
remarkably
small
feet
and
the
other
unusually
large
ones
on
the
whole
it
was
most
probable
that
the
silent
englishman
being
less
bold
or
less
murderous
than
his
companion
had
assisted
the
woman
to
bear
the
unconscious
man
out
of
the
way
of
danger
well
said
our
engineer
ruefully
as
we
took
our
seats
to
return
once
more
to
london
it
has
been  pretty
business
for
me  have
lost
my
thumb
and  have
lost  fifty
guinea
fee
and
what
have  gained
experience
said
holmes
laughing
indirectly
it
may
be
of
value
you
know
you
have
only
to
put
it
into
words
to
gain
the
reputation
of
being
excellent
company
for
the
remainder
of
your
existence  the
adventure
of
the
noble
bachelor
the
lord
st
simon
marriage
and
its
curious
termination
have
long
ceased
to
be  subject
of
interest
in
those
exalted
circles
in
which
the
unfortunate
bridegroom
moves
fresh
scandals
have
eclipsed
it
and
their
more
piquant
details
have
drawn
the
gossips
away
from
this
four
year
old
drama
as  have
reason
to
believe
however
that
the
full
facts
have
never
been
revealed
to
the
general
public
and
as
my
friend
sherlock
holmes
had  considerable
share
in
clearing
the
matter
up  feel
that
no
memoir
of
him
would
be
complete
without
some
little
sketch
of
this
remarkable
episode
it
was  few
weeks
before
my
own
marriage
during
the
days
when  was
still
sharing
rooms
with
holmes
in
baker
street
that
he
came
home
from
an
afternoon
stroll
to
find  letter
on
the
table
waiting
for
him  had
remained
indoors
all
day
for
the
weather
had
taken  sudden
turn
to
rain
with
high
autumnal
winds
and
the
jezail
bullet
which  had
brought
back
in
one
of
my
limbs
as  relic
of
my
afghan
campaign
throbbed
with
dull
persistence
with
my
body
in
one
easy
chair
and
my
legs
upon
another  had
surrounded
myself
with  cloud
of
newspapers
until
at
last
saturated
with
the
news
of
the
day  tossed
them
all
aside
and
lay
listless
watching
the
huge
crest
and
monogram
upon
the
envelope
upon
the
table
and
wondering
lazily
who
my
friend  noble
correspondent
could
be
here
is  very
fashionable
epistle  remarked
as
he
entered
your
morning
letters
if  remember
right
were
from  fish
monger
and  tide
waiter
yes
my
correspondence
has
certainly
the
charm
of
variety
he
answered
smiling
and
the
humbler
are
usually
the
more
interesting
this
looks
like
one
of
those
unwelcome
social
summonses
which
call
upon  man
either
to
be
bored
or
to
lie
he
broke
the
seal
and
glanced
over
the
contents
oh
come
it
may
prove
to
be
something
of
interest
after
all
not
social
then
no
distinctly
professional
and
from  noble
client
one
of
the
highest
in
england
my
dear
fellow  congratulate
you  assure
you
watson
without
affectation
that
the
status
of
my
client
is  matter
of
less
moment
to
me
than
the
interest
of
his
case
it
is
just
possible
however
that
that
also
may
not
be
wanting
in
this
new
investigation
you
have
been
reading
the
papers
diligently
of
late
have
you
not
it
looks
like
it
said  ruefully
pointing
to  huge
bundle
in
the
corner  have
had
nothing
else
to
do
it
is
fortunate
for
you
will
perhaps
be
able
to
post
me
up  read
nothing
except
the
criminal
news
and
the
agony
column
the
latter
is
always
instructive
but
if
you
have
followed
recent
events
so
closely
you
must
have
read
about
lord
st
simon
and
his
wedding
oh
yes
with
the
deepest
interest
that
is
well
the
letter
which  hold
in
my
hand
is
from
lord
st
simon  will
read
it
to
you
and
in
return
you
must
turn
over
these
papers
and
let
me
have
whatever
bears
upon
the
matter
this
is
what
he
says
my
dear
mr
sherlock
holmes
lord
backwater
tells
me
that  may
place
implicit
reliance
upon
your
judgment
and
discretion  have
determined
therefore
to
call
upon
you
and
to
consult
you
in
reference
to
the
very
painful
event
which
has
occurred
in
connection
with
my
wedding
mr
lestrade
of
scotland
yard
is
acting
already
in
the
matter
but
he
assures
me
that
he
sees
no
objection
to
your
co
operation
and
that
he
even
thinks
that
it
might
be
of
some
assistance  will
call
at
four  clock
in
the
afternoon
and
should
you
have
any
other
engagement
at
that
time  hope
that
you
will
postpone
it
as
this
matter
is
of
paramount
importance
yours
faithfully
st
simon
it
is
dated
from
grosvenor
mansions
written
with  quill
pen
and
the
noble
lord
has
had
the
misfortune
to
get  smear
of
ink
upon
the
outer
side
of
his
right
little
finger
remarked
holmes
as
he
folded
up
the
epistle
he
says
four  clock
it
is
three
now
he
will
be
here
in
an
hour
then  have
just
time
with
your
assistance
to
get
clear
upon
the
subject
turn
over
those
papers
and
arrange
the
extracts
in
their
order
of
time
while  take  glance
as
to
who
our

plantagenet
blood
by
direct
descent
and
tudor
on
the
distaff
side
ha
well
there
is
nothing
very
instructive
in
all
this  think
that  must
turn
to
you
watson
for
something
more
solid  have
very
little
difficulty
in
finding
what  want
said  for
the
facts
are
quite
recent
and
the
matter
struck
me
as
remarkable  feared
to
refer
them
to
you
however
as  knew
that
you
had
an
inquiry
on
hand
and
that
you
disliked
the
intrusion
of
other
matters
oh
you
mean
the
little
problem
of
the
grosvenor
square
furniture
van
that
is
quite
cleared
up
now
though
indeed
it
was
obvious
from
the
first
pray
give
me
the
results
of
your
newspaper
selections
here
is
the
first
notice
which  can
find
it
is
in
the
personal
column
of
the
morning
post
and
dates
as
you
see
some
weeks
back  marriage
has
been
arranged
it
says
and
will
if
rumour
is
correct
very
shortly
take
place
between
lord
robert
st
simon
second
son
of
the
duke
of
balmoral
and
miss
hatty
doran
the
only
daughter
of
aloysius
doran
esq
of
san
francisco
cal  s  that
is
all
terse
and
to
the
point
remarked
holmes
stretching
his
long
thin
legs
towards
the
fire
there
was  paragraph
amplifying
this
in
one
of
the
society
papers
of
the
same
week
ah
here
it
is
there
will
soon
be  call
for
protection
in
the
marriage
market
for
the
present
free
trade
principle
appears
to
tell
heavily
against
our
home
product
one
by
one
the
management
of
the
noble
houses
of
great
britain
is
passing
into
the
hands
of
our
fair
cousins
from
across
the
atlantic
an
important
addition
has
been
made
during
the
last
week
to
the
list
of
the
prizes
which
have
been
borne
away
by
these
charming
invaders
lord
st
simon
who
has
shown
himself
for
over
twenty
years
proof
against
the
little
god  arrows
has
now
definitely
announced
his
approaching
marriage
with
miss
hatty
doran
the
fascinating
daughter
of  california
millionaire
miss
doran
whose
graceful
figure
and
striking
face
attracted
much
attention
at
the
westbury
house
festivities
is
an
only
child
and
it
is
currently
reported
that
her
dowry
will
run
to
considerably
over
the
six
figures
with
expectancies
for
the
future
as
it
is
an
open
secret
that
the
duke
of
balmoral
has
been
compelled
to
sell
his
pictures
within
the
last
few
years
and
as
lord
st
simon
has
no
property
of
his
own
save
the
small
estate
of
birchmoor
it
is
obvious
that
the
californian
heiress
is
not
the
only
gainer
by
an
alliance
which
will
enable
her
to
make
the
easy
and
common
transition
from  republican
lady
to  british
peeress
anything
else
asked
holmes
yawning
oh
yes
plenty
then
there
is
another
note
in
the
morning
post
to
say
that
the
marriage
would
be
an
absolutely
quiet
one
that
it
would
be
at
st
george  hanover
square
that
only
half  dozen
intimate
friends
would
be
invited
and
that
the
party
would
return
to
the
furnished
house
at
lancaster
gate
which
has
been
taken
by
mr
aloysius
doran
two
days
later
that
is
on
wednesday
last
there
is  curt
announcement
that
the
wedding
had
taken
place
and
that
the
honeymoon
would
be
passed
at
lord
backwater  place
near
petersfield
those
are
all
the
notices
which
appeared
before
the
disappearance
of
the
bride
before
the
what
asked
holmes
with  start
the
vanishing
of
the
lady
when
did
she
vanish
then
at
the
wedding
breakfast
indeed
this
is
more
interesting
than
it
promised
to
be
quite
dramatic
in
fact
yes
it
struck
me
as
being  little
out
of
the
common
they
often
vanish
before
the
ceremony
and
occasionally
during
the
honeymoon
but  cannot
call
to
mind
anything
quite
so
prompt
as
this
pray
let
me
have
the
details  warn
you
that
they
are
very
incomplete
perhaps
we
may
make
them
less
so
such
as
they
are
they
are
set
forth
in  single
article
of  morning
paper
of
yesterday
which  will
read
to
you
it
is
headed
singular
occurrence
at  fashionable
wedding
the
family
of
lord
robert
st
simon
has
been
thrown
into
the
greatest
consternation
by
the
strange
and
painful
episodes
which
have
taken
place
in
connection
with
his
wedding
the
ceremony
as
shortly
announced
in
the
papers
of
yesterday
occurred
on
the
previous
morning
but
it
is
only
now
that
it
has
been
possible
to
confirm
the
strange
rumours
which
have
been
so
persistently
floating
about
in
spite
of
the
attempts
of
the
friends
to
hush
the
matter
up
so
much
public
attention
has
now
been
drawn
to
it
that
no
good
purpose
can
be
served
by
affecting
to
disregard
what
is  common
subject
for
conversation
the
ceremony
which
was
performed
at
st
george  hanover
square
was  very
quiet
one
no
one
being
present
save
the
father
of
the
bride
mr
aloysius
doran
the
duchess
of
balmoral
lord
backwater
lord
eustace
and
lady
clara
st
simon
the
younger
brother
and
sister
of
the
bridegroom
and
lady
alicia
whittington
the
whole
party
proceeded
afterwards
to
the
house
of
mr
aloysius
doran
at
lancaster
gate
where
breakfast
had
been
prepared
it
appears
that
some
little
trouble
was
caused
by  woman
whose
name
has
not
been
ascertained
who
endeavoured
to
force
her
way
into
the
house
after
the
bridal
party
alleging
that
she
had
some
claim
upon
lord
st
simon
it
was
only
after  painful
and
prolonged
scene
that
she
was
ejected
by
the
butler
and
the
footman
the
bride
who
had
fortunately
entered
the
house
before
this
unpleasant
interruption
had
sat
down
to
breakfast
with
the
rest
when
she
complained
of  sudden
indisposition
and
retired
to
her
room
her
prolonged
absence
having
caused
some
comment
her
father
followed
her
but
learned
from
her
maid
that
she
had
only
come
up
to
her
chamber
for
an
instant
caught
up
an
ulster
and
bonnet
and
hurried
down
to
the
passage
one
of
the
footmen
declared
that
he
had
seen  lady
leave
the
house
thus
apparelled
but
had
refused
to
credit
that
it
was
his
mistress
believing
her
to
be
with
the
company
on
ascertaining
that
his
daughter
had
disappeared
mr
aloysius
doran
in
conjunction
with
the
bridegroom
instantly
put
themselves
in
communication
with
the
police
and
very
energetic
inquiries
are
being
made
which
will
probably
result
in  speedy
clearing
up
of
this
very
singular
business
up
to  late
hour
last
night
however
nothing
had
transpired
as
to
the
whereabouts
of
the
missing
lady
there
are
rumours
of
foul
play
in
the
matter
and
it
is
said
that
the
police
have
caused
the
arrest
of
the
woman
who
had
caused
the
original
disturbance
in
the
belief
that
from
jealousy
or
some
other
motive
she
may
have
been
concerned
in
the
strange
disappearance
of
the
bride
and
is
that
all
only
one
little
item
in
another
of
the
morning
papers
but
it
is  suggestive
one
and
it
is
that
miss
flora
millar
the
lady
who
had
caused
the
disturbance
has
actually
been
arrested
it
appears
that
she
was
formerly  danseuse
at
the
allegro
and
that
she
has
known
the
bridegroom
for
some
years
there
are
no
further
particulars
and
the
whole
case
is
in
your
hands
now
so
far
as
it
has
been
set
forth
in
the
public
press
and
an
exceedingly
interesting
case
it
appears
to
be  would
not
have
missed
it
for
worlds
but
there
is  ring
at
the
bell
watson
and
as
the
clock
makes
it  few
minutes
after
four  have
no
doubt
that
this
will
prove
to
be
our
noble
client
do
not
dream
of
going
watson
for  very
much
prefer
having  witness
if
only
as  check
to
my
own
memory
lord
robert
st
simon
announced
our
page
boy
throwing
open
the
door  gentleman
entered
with  pleasant
cultured
face
high
nosed
and
pale
with
something
perhaps
of
petulance
about
the
mouth
and
with
the
steady
well
opened
eye
of  man
whose
pleasant
lot
it
had
ever
been
to
command
and
to
be
obeyed
his
manner
was
brisk
and
yet
his
general
appearance
gave
an
undue
impression
of
age
for
he
had  slight
forward
stoop
and  little
bend
of
the
knees
as
he
walked
his
hair
too
as
he
swept
off
his
very
curly
brimmed
hat
was
grizzled
round
the
edges
and
thin
upon
the
top
as
to
his
dress
it
was
careful
to
the
verge
of
foppishness
with
high
collar
black
frock
coat
white
waistcoat
yellow
gloves
patent
leather
shoes
and
light
coloured
gaiters
he
advanced
slowly
into
the
room
turning
his
head
from
left
to
right
and
swinging
in
his
right
hand
the
cord
which
held
his
golden
eyeglasses
good
day
lord
st
simon
said
holmes
rising
and
bowing
pray
take
the
basket
chair
this
is
my
friend
and
colleague
dr
watson
draw
up  little
to
the
fire
and
we
will
talk
this
matter
over  most
painful
matter
to
me
as
you
can
most
readily
imagine
mr
holmes  have
been
cut
to
the
quick  understand
that
you
have
already
managed
several
delicate
cases
of
this
sort
sir
though  presume
that
they
were
hardly
from
the
same
class
of
society
no  am
descending  beg
pardon
my
last
client
of
the
sort
was  king
oh
really  had
no
idea
and
which
king
the
king
of
scandinavia
what
had
he
lost
his
wife
you
can
understand
said
holmes
suavely
that  extend
to
the
affairs
of
my
other
clients
the
same
secrecy
which  promise
to
you
in
yours
of
course
very
right
very
right  m
sure  beg
pardon
as
to
my
own
case  am
ready
to
give
you
any
information
which
may
assist
you
in
forming
an
opinion
thank
you  have
already
learned
all
that
is
in
the
public
prints
nothing
more  presume
that  may
take
it
as
correct
this
article
for
example
as
to
the
disappearance
of
the
bride
lord
st
simon
glanced
over
it
yes
it
is
correct
as
far
as
it
goes
but
it
needs  great
deal
of
supplementing
before
anyone
could
offer
an
opinion  think
that  may
arrive
at
my
facts
most
directly
by
questioning
you
pray
do
so
when
did
you
first
meet
miss
hatty
doran
in
san
francisco  year
ago
you
were
travelling
in
the
states
yes
did
you
become
engaged
then
no
but
you
were
on  friendly
footing  was
amused
by
her
society
and
she
could
see
that  was
amused
her
father
is
very
rich
he
is
said
to
be
the
richest
man
on
the
pacific
slope
and
how
did
he
make
his
money
in
mining
he
had
nothing  few
years
ago
then
he
struck
gold
invested
it
and
came
up
by
leaps
and
bounds
now
what
is
your
own
impression
as
to
the
young
lady  your
wife  character
the
nobleman
swung
his
glasses  little
faster
and
stared
down
into
the
fire
you
see
mr
holmes
said
he
my
wife
was
twenty
before
her
father
became  rich
man
during
that
time
she
ran
free
in  mining
camp
and
wandered
through
woods
or
mountains
so
that
her
education
has
come
from
nature
rather
than
from
the
schoolmaster
she
is
what
we
call
in
england  tomboy
with  strong
nature
wild
and
free
unfettered
by
any
sort
of
traditions
she
is
impetuous
volcanic  was
about
to
say
she
is
swift
in
making
up
her
mind
and
fearless
in
carrying
out
her
resolutions
on
the
other
hand  would
not
have
given
her
the
name
which  have
the
honour
to
bear
he
gave  little
stately
cough
had  not
thought
her
to
be
at
bottom  noble
woman  believe
that
she
is
capable
of
heroic
self
sacrifice
and
that
anything
dishonourable
would
be
repugnant
to
her
have
you
her
photograph  brought
this
with
me
he
opened  locket
and
showed
us
the
full
face
of  very
lovely
woman
it
was
not  photograph
but
an
ivory
miniature
and
the
artist
had
brought
out
the
full
effect
of
the
lustrous
black
hair
the
large
dark
eyes
and
the
exquisite
mouth
holmes
gazed
long
and
earnestly
at
it
then
he
closed
the
locket
and
handed
it
back
to
lord
st
simon
the
young
lady
came
to
london
then
and
you
renewed
your
acquaintance
yes
her
father
brought
her
over
for
this
last
london
season  met
her
several
times
became
engaged
to
her
and
have
now
married
her
she
brought  understand  considerable
dowry  fair
dowry
not
more
than
is
usual
in
my
family
and
this
of
course
remains
to
you
since
the
marriage
is  fait
accompli  really
have
made
no
inquiries
on
the
subject
very
naturally
not
did
you
see
miss
doran
on
the
day
before
the
wedding
yes
was
she
in
good
spirits
never
better
she
kept
talking
of
what
we
should
do
in
our
future
lives
indeed
that
is
very
interesting
and
on
the
morning
of
the
wedding
she
was
as
bright
as
possible
at
least
until
after
the
ceremony
and
did
you
observe
any
change
in
her
then
well
to
tell
the
truth  saw
then
the
first
signs
that  had
ever
seen
that
her
temper
was
just  little
sharp
the
incident
however
was
too
trivial
to
relate
and
can
have
no
possible
bearing
upon
the
case
pray
let
us
have
it
for
all
that
oh
it
is
childish
she
dropped
her
bouquet
as
we
went
towards
the
vestry
she
was
passing
the
front
pew
at
the
time
and
it
fell
over
into
the
pew
there
was  moment  delay
but
the
gentleman
in
the
pew
handed
it
up
to
her
again
and
it
did
not
appear
to
be
the
worse
for
the
fall
yet
when  spoke
to
her
of
the
matter
she
answered
me
abruptly
and
in
the
carriage
on
our
way
home
she
seemed
absurdly
agitated
over
this
trifling
cause
indeed
you
say
that
there
was  gentleman
in
the
pew
some
of
the
general
public
were
present
then
oh
yes
it
is
impossible
to
exclude
them
when
the
church
is
open
this
gentleman
was
not
one
of
your
wife  friends
no
no  call
him  gentleman
by
courtesy
but
he
was
quite  common
looking
person  hardly
noticed
his
appearance
but
really  think
that
we
are
wandering
rather
far
from
the
point
lady
st
simon
then
returned
from
the
wedding
in  less
cheerful
frame
of
mind
than
she
had
gone
to
it
what
did
she
do
on
re
entering
her
father  house  saw
her
in
conversation
with
her
maid
and
who
is
her
maid
alice
is
her
name
she
is
an
american
and
came
from
california
with
her  confidential
servant  little
too
much
so
it
seemed
to
me
that
her
mistress
allowed
her
to
take
great
liberties
still
of
course
in
america
they
look
upon
these
things
in  different
way
how
long
did
she
speak
to
this
alice
oh  few
minutes  had
something
else
to
think
of
you
did
not
overhear
what
they
said
lady
st
simon
said
something
about
jumping  claim
she
was
accustomed
to
use
slang
of
the
kind  have
no
idea
what
she
meant
american
slang
is
very
expressive
sometimes
and
what
did
your
wife
do
when
she
finished
speaking
to
her
maid
she
walked
into
the
breakfast
room
on
your
arm
no
alone
she
was
very
independent
in
little
matters
like
that
then
after
we
had
sat
down
for
ten
minutes
or
so
she
rose
hurriedly
muttered
some
words
of
apology
and
left
the
room
she
never
came
back
but
this
maid
alice
as  understand
deposes
that
she
went
to
her
room
covered
her
bride  dress
with  long
ulster
put
on  bonnet
and
went
out
quite
so
and
she
was
afterwards
seen
walking
into
hyde
park
in
company
with
flora
millar  woman
who
is
now
in
custody
and
who
had
already
made  disturbance
at
mr
doran  house
that
morning
ah
yes  should
like  few
particulars
as
to
this
young
lady
and
your
relations
to
her
lord
st
simon
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
raised
his
eyebrows
we
have
been
on  friendly
footing
for
some
years  may
say
on  very
friendly
footing
she
used
to
be
at
the
allegro  have
not
treated
her
ungenerously
and
she
had
no
just
cause
of
complaint
against
me
but
you
know
what
women
are
mr
holmes
flora
was  dear
little
thing
but
exceedingly
hot
headed
and
devotedly
attached
to
me
she
wrote
me
dreadful
letters
when
she
heard
that  was
about
to
be
married
and
to
tell
the
truth
the
reason
why  had
the
marriage
celebrated
so
quietly
was
that  feared
lest
there
might
be  scandal
in
the
church
she
came
to
mr
doran  door
just
after
we
returned
and
she
endeavoured
to
push
her
way
in
uttering
very
abusive
expressions
towards
my
wife
and
even
threatening
her
but  had
foreseen
the
possibility
of
something
of
the
sort
and  had
two
police
fellows
there
in
private
clothes
who
soon
pushed
her
out
again
she
was
quiet
when
she
saw
that
there
was
no
good
in
making  row
did
your
wife
hear
all
this
no
thank
goodness
she
did
not
and
she
was
seen
walking
with
this
very
woman
afterwards
yes
that
is
what
mr
lestrade
of
scotland
yard
looks
upon
as
so
serious
it
is
thought
that
flora
decoyed
my
wife
out
and
laid
some
terrible
trap
for
her
well
it
is  possible
supposition
you
think
so
too  did
not
say  probable
one
but
you
do
not
yourself
look
upon
this
as
likely  do
not
think
flora
would
hurt  fly
still
jealousy
is  strange
transformer
of
characters
pray
what
is
your
own
theory
as
to
what
took
place
well
really  came
to
seek  theory
not
to
propound
one  have
given
you
all
the
facts
since
you
ask
me
however  may
say
that
it
has
occurred
to
me
as
possible
that
the
excitement
of
this
affair
the
consciousness
that
she
had
made
so
immense  social
stride
had
the
effect
of
causing
some
little
nervous
disturbance
in
my
wife
in
short
that
she
had
become
suddenly
deranged
well
really
when  consider
that
she
has
turned
her
back  will
not
say
upon
me
but
upon
so
much
that
many
have
aspired
to
without
success  can
hardly
explain
it
in
any
other
fashion
well
certainly
that
is
also  conceivable
hypothesis
said
holmes
smiling
and
now
lord
st
simon  think
that  have
nearly
all
my
data
may  ask
whether
you
were
seated
at
the
breakfast
table
so
that
you
could
see
out
of
the
window
we
could
see
the
other
side
of
the
road
and
the
park
quite
so
then  do
not
think
that  need
to
detain
you
longer  shall
communicate
with
you
should
you
be
fortunate
enough
to
solve
this
problem
said
our
client
rising  have
solved
it
eh
what
was
that  say
that  have
solved
it
where
then
is
my
wife
that
is  detail
which  shall
speedily
supply
lord
st
simon
shook
his
head  am
afraid
that
it
will
take
wiser
heads
than
yours
or
mine
he
remarked
and
bowing
in  stately
old
fashioned
manner
he
departed
it
is
very
good
of
lord
st
simon
to
honour
my
head
by
putting
it
on  level
with
his
own
said
sherlock
holmes
laughing  think
that  shall
have  whisky
and
soda
and  cigar
after
all
this
cross
questioning  had
formed
my
conclusions
as
to
the
case
before
our
client
came
into
the
room
my
dear
holmes  have
notes
of
several
similar
cases
though
none
as  remarked
before
which
were
quite
as
prompt
my
whole
examination
served
to
turn
my
conjecture
into  certainty
circumstantial
evidence
is
occasionally
very
convincing
as
when
you
find  trout
in
the
milk
to
quote
thoreau  example
but  have
heard
all
that
you
have
heard
without
however
the
knowledge
of
pre
existing
cases
which
serves
me
so
well
there
was  parallel
instance
in
aberdeen
some
years
back
and
something
on
very
much
the
same
lines
at
munich
the
year
after
the
franco
prussian
war
it
is
one
of
these
cases
but
hullo
here
is
lestrade
good
afternoon
lestrade
you
will
find
an
extra
tumbler
upon
the
sideboard
and
there
are
cigars
in
the
box
the
official
detective
was
attired
in  pea
jacket
and
cravat
which
gave
him  decidedly
nautical
appearance
and
he
carried  black
canvas
bag
in
his
hand
with  short
greeting
he
seated
himself
and
lit
the
cigar
which
had
been
offered
to
him
what  up
then
asked
holmes
with  twinkle
in
his
eye
you
look
dissatisfied
and  feel
dissatisfied
it
is
this
infernal
st
simon
marriage
case  can
make
neither
head
nor
tail
of
the
business
really
you
surprise
me
who
ever
heard
of
such  mixed
affair
every
clue
seems
to
slip
through
my
fingers  have
been
at
work
upon
it
all
day
and
very
wet
it
seems
to
have
made
you
said
holmes
laying
his
hand
upon
the
arm
of
the
pea
jacket
yes  have
been
dragging
the
serpentine
in
heaven  name
what
for
in
search
of
the
body
of
lady
st
simon
sherlock
holmes
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
laughed
heartily
have
you
dragged
the
basin
of
trafalgar
square
fountain
he
asked
why
what
do
you
mean
because
you
have
just
as
good  chance
of
finding
this
lady
in
the
one
as
in
the
other
lestrade
shot
an
angry
glance
at
my
companion  suppose
you
know
all
about
it
he
snarled
well  have
only
just
heard
the
facts
but
my
mind
is
made
up
oh
indeed
then
you
think
that
the
serpentine
plays
no
part
in
the
matter  think
it
very
unlikely
then
perhaps
you
will
kindly
explain
how
it
is
that
we
found
this
in
it
he
opened
his
bag
as
he
spoke
and
tumbled
onto
the
floor  wedding
dress
of
watered
silk  pair
of
white
satin
shoes
and  bride  wreath
and
veil
all
discoloured
and
soaked
in
water
there
said
he
putting  new
wedding
ring
upon
the
top
of
the
pile
there
is  little
nut
for
you
to
crack
master
holmes
oh
indeed
said
my
friend
blowing
blue
rings
into
the
air
you
dragged
them
from
the
serpentine
no
they
were
found
floating
near
the
margin
by  park
keeper
they
have
been
identified
as
her
clothes
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
if
the
clothes
were
there
the
body
would
not
be
far
off
by
the
same
brilliant
reasoning
every
man  body
is
to
be
found
in
the
neighbourhood
of
his
wardrobe
and
pray
what
did
you
hope
to
arrive
at
through
this
at
some
evidence
implicating
flora
millar
in
the
disappearance  am
afraid
that
you
will
find
it
difficult
are
you
indeed
now
cried
lestrade
with
some
bitterness  am
afraid
holmes
that
you
are
not
very
practical
with
your
deductions
and
your
inferences
you
have
made
two
blunders
in
as
many
minutes
this
dress
does
implicate
miss
flora
millar
and
how
in
the
dress
is  pocket
in
the
pocket
is  card
case
in
the
card
case
is  note
and
here
is
the
very
note
he
slapped
it
down
upon
the
table
in
front
of
him
listen
to
this
you
will
see
me
when
all
is
ready
come
at
once  h  now
my
theory
all
along
has
been
that
lady
st
simon
was
decoyed
away
by
flora
millar
and
that
she
with
confederates
no
doubt
was
responsible
for
her
disappearance
here
signed
with
her
initials
is
the
very
note
which
was
no
doubt
quietly
slipped
into
her
hand
at
the
door
and
which
lured
her
within
their
reach
very
good
lestrade
said
holmes
laughing
you
really
are
very
fine
indeed
let
me
see
it
he
took
up
the
paper
in  listless
way
but
his
attention
instantly
became
riveted
and
he
gave  little
cry
of
satisfaction
this
is
indeed
important
said
he
ha
you
find
it
so
extremely
so  congratulate
you
warmly
lestrade
rose
in
his
triumph
and
bent
his
head
to
look
why
he
shrieked
you
re
looking
at
the
wrong
side
on
the
contrary
this
is
the
right
side
the
right
side
you
re
mad
here
is
the
note
written
in
pencil
over
here
and
over
here
is
what
appears
to
be
the
fragment
of  hotel
bill
which
interests
me
deeply
there  nothing
in
it  looked
at
it
before
said
lestrade
oct
th
rooms  breakfast  d
cocktail  lunch  d
glass
sherry  i
see
nothing
in
that
very
likely
not
it
is
most
important
all
the
same
as
to
the
note
it
is
important
also
or
at
least
the
initials
are
so  congratulate
you
again  ve
wasted
time
enough
said
lestrade
rising  believe
in
hard
work
and
not
in
sitting
by
the
fire
spinning
fine
theories
good
day
mr
holmes
and
we
shall
see
which
gets
to
the
bottom
of
the
matter
first
he
gathered
up
the
garments
thrust
them
into
the
bag
and
made
for
the
door
just
one
hint
to
you
lestrade
drawled
holmes
before
his
rival
vanished  will
tell
you
the
true
solution
of
the
matter
lady
st
simon
is  myth
there
is
not
and
there
never
has
been
any
such
person
lestrade
looked
sadly
at
my
companion
then
he
turned
to
me
tapped
his
forehead
three
times
shook
his
head
solemnly
and
hurried
away
he
had
hardly
shut
the
door
behind
him
when
holmes
rose
to
put
on
his
overcoat
there
is
something
in
what
the
fellow
says
about
outdoor
work
he
remarked
so  think
watson
that  must
leave
you
to
your
papers
for  little
it
was
after
five  clock
when
sherlock
holmes
left
me
but  had
no
time
to
be
lonely
for
within
an
hour
there
arrived  confectioner  man
with  very
large
flat
box
this
he
unpacked
with
the
help
of  youth
whom
he
had
brought
with
him
and
presently
to
my
very
great
astonishment  quite
epicurean
little
cold
supper
began
to
be
laid
out
upon
our
humble
lodging
house
mahogany
there
were  couple
of
brace
of
cold
woodcock  pheasant  pate
de
foie
gras
pie
with  group
of
ancient
and
cobwebby
bottles
having
laid
out
all
these
luxuries
my
two
visitors
vanished
away
like
the
genii
of
the
arabian
nights
with
no
explanation
save
that
the
things
had
been
paid
for
and
were
ordered
to
this
address
just
before
nine  clock
sherlock
holmes
stepped
briskly
into
the
room
his
features
were
gravely
set
but
there
was  light
in
his
eye
which
made
me
think
that
he
had
not
been
disappointed
in
his
conclusions
they
have
laid
the
supper
then
he
said
rubbing
his
hands
you
seem
to
expect
company
they
have
laid
for
five
yes  fancy
we
may
have
some
company
dropping
in
said
he  am
surprised
that
lord
st
simon
has
not
already
arrived
ha  fancy
that  hear
his
step
now
upon
the
stairs
it
was
indeed
our
visitor
of
the
afternoon
who
came
bustling
in
dangling
his
glasses
more
vigorously
than
ever
and
with  very
perturbed
expression
upon
his
aristocratic
features
my
messenger
reached
you
then
asked
holmes
yes
and  confess
that
the
contents
startled
me
beyond
measure
have
you
good
authority
for
what
you
say
the
best
possible
lord
st
simon
sank
into  chair
and
passed
his
hand
over
his
forehead
what
will
the
duke
say
he
murmured
when
he
hears
that
one
of
the
family
has
been
subjected
to
such
humiliation
it
is
the
purest
accident  cannot
allow
that
there
is
any
humiliation
ah
you
look
on
these
things
from
another
standpoint  fail
to
see
that
anyone
is
to
blame  can
hardly
see
how
the
lady
could
have
acted
otherwise
though
her
abrupt
method
of
doing
it
was
undoubtedly
to
be
regretted
having
no
mother
she
had
no
one
to
advise
her
at
such  crisis
it
was  slight
sir  public
slight
said
lord
st
simon
tapping
his
fingers
upon
the
table
you
must
make
allowance
for
this
poor
girl
placed
in
so
unprecedented  position  will
make
no
allowance  am
very
angry
indeed
and  have
been
shamefully
used  think
that  heard  ring
said
holmes
yes
there
are
steps
on
the
landing
if  cannot
persuade
you
to
take  lenient
view
of
the
matter
lord
st
simon  have
brought
an
advocate
here
who
may
be
more
successful
he
opened
the
door
and
ushered
in  lady
and
gentleman
lord
st
simon
said
he
allow
me
to
introduce
you
to
mr
and
mrs
francis
hay
moulton
the
lady  think
you
have
already
met
at
the
sight
of
these
newcomers
our
client
had
sprung
from
his
seat
and
stood
very
erect
with
his
eyes
cast
down
and
his
hand
thrust
into
the
breast
of
his
frock
coat  picture
of
offended
dignity
the
lady
had
taken  quick
step
forward
and
had
held
out
her
hand
to
him
but
he
still
refused
to
raise
his
eyes
it
was
as
well
for
his
resolution
perhaps
for
her
pleading
face
was
one
which
it
was
hard
to
resist
you
re
angry
robert
said
she
well  guess
you
have
every
cause
to
be
pray
make
no
apology
to
me
said
lord
st
simon
bitterly
oh
yes  know
that  have
treated
you
real
bad
and
that  should
have
spoken
to
you
before  went
but  was
kind
of
rattled
and
from
the
time
when  saw
frank
here
again  just
didn  know
what  was
doing
or
saying  only
wonder  didn  fall
down
and
do  faint
right
there
before
the
altar
perhaps
mrs
moulton
you
would
like
my
friend
and
me
to
leave
the
room
while
you
explain
this
matter
if  may
give
an
opinion
remarked
the
strange
gentleman
we
ve
had
just  little
too
much
secrecy
over
this
business
already
for
my
part  should
like
all
europe
and
america
to
hear
the
rights
of
it
he
was  small
wiry
sunburnt
man
clean
shaven
with  sharp
face
and
alert
manner
then  ll
tell
our
story
right
away
said
the
lady
frank
here
and  met
in
in
mcquire  camp
near
the
rockies
where
pa
was
working  claim
we
were
engaged
to
each
other
frank
and  but
then
one
day
father
struck  rich
pocket
and
made  pile
while
poor
frank
here
had  claim
that
petered
out
and
came
to
nothing
the
richer
pa
grew
the
poorer
was
frank
so
at
last
pa
wouldn  hear
of
our
engagement
lasting
any
longer
and
he
took
me
away
to
frisco
frank
wouldn  throw
up
his
hand
though
so
he
followed
me
there
and
he
saw
me
without
pa
knowing
anything
about
it
it
would
only
have
made
him
mad
to
know
so
we
just
fixed
it
all
up
for
ourselves
frank
said
that
he
would
go
and
make
his
pile
too
and
never
come
back
to
claim
me
until
he
had
as
much
as
pa
so
then  promised
to
wait
for
him
to
the
end
of
time
and
pledged
myself
not
to
marry
anyone
else
while
he
lived
why
shouldn  we
be
married
right
away
then
said
he
and
then  will
feel
sure
of
you
and  won  claim
to
be
your
husband
until  come
back
well
we
talked
it
over
and
he
had
fixed
it
all
up
so
nicely
with  clergyman
all
ready
in
waiting
that
we
just
did
it
right
there
and
then
frank
went
off
to
seek
his
fortune
and  went
back
to
pa
the
next  heard
of
frank
was
that
he
was
in
montana
and
then
he
went
prospecting
in
arizona
and
then  heard
of
him
from
new
mexico
after
that
came  long
newspaper
story
about
how  miners
camp
had
been
attacked
by
apache
indians
and
there
was
my
frank  name
among
the
killed  fainted
dead
away
and  was
very
sick
for
months
after
pa
thought  had  decline
and
took
me
to
half
the
doctors
in
frisco
not  word
of
news
came
for  year
and
more
so
that  never
doubted
that
frank
was
really
dead
then
lord
st
simon
came
to
frisco
and
we
came
to
london
and  marriage
was
arranged
and
pa
was
very
pleased
but  felt
all
the
time
that
no
man
on
this
earth
would
ever
take
the
place
in
my
heart
that
had
been
given
to
my
poor
frank
still
if  had
married
lord
st
simon
of
course  d
have
done
my
duty
by
him
we
can  command
our
love
but
we
can
our
actions  went
to
the
altar
with
him
with
the
intention
to
make
him
just
as
good  wife
as
it
was
in
me
to
be
but
you
may
imagine
what  felt
when
just
as  came
to
the
altar
rails  glanced
back
and
saw
frank
standing
and
looking
at
me
out
of
the
first
pew  thought
it
was
his
ghost
at
first
but
when  looked
again
there
he
was
still
with  kind
of
question
in
his
eyes
as
if
to
ask
me
whether  were
glad
or
sorry
to
see
him  wonder  didn  drop  know
that
everything
was
turning
round
and
the
words
of
the
clergyman
were
just
like
the
buzz
of  bee
in
my
ear  didn  know
what
to
do
should  stop
the
service
and
make  scene
in
the
church  glanced
at
him
again
and
he
seemed
to
know
what  was
thinking
for
he
raised
his
finger
to
his
lips
to
tell
me
to
be
still
then  saw
him
scribble
on  piece
of
paper
and  knew
that
he
was
writing
me  note
as  passed
his
pew
on
the
way
out  dropped
my
bouquet
over
to
him
and
he
slipped
the
note
into
my
hand
when
he
returned
me
the
flowers
it
was
only  line
asking
me
to
join
him
when
he
made
the
sign
to
me
to
do
so
of
course  never
doubted
for  moment
that
my
first
duty
was
now
to
him
and  determined
to
do
just
whatever
he
might
direct
when  got
back  told
my
maid
who
had
known
him
in
california
and
had
always
been
his
friend  ordered
her
to
say
nothing
but
to
get  few
things
packed
and
my
ulster
ready  know  ought
to
have
spoken
to
lord
st
simon
but
it
was
dreadful
hard
before
his
mother
and
all
those
great
people  just
made
up
my
mind
to
run
away
and
explain
afterwards  hadn  been
at
the
table
ten
minutes
before  saw
frank
out
of
the
window
at
the
other
side
of
the
road
he
beckoned
to
me
and
then
began
walking
into
the
park  slipped
out
put
on
my
things
and
followed
him
some
woman
came
talking
something
or
other
about
lord
st
simon
to
me
seemed
to
me
from
the
little  heard
as
if
he
had  little
secret
of
his
own
before
marriage
also
but  managed
to
get
away
from
her
and
soon
overtook
frank
we
got
into  cab
together
and
away
we
drove
to
some
lodgings
he
had
taken
in
gordon
square
and
that
was
my
true
wedding
after
all
those
years
of
waiting
frank
had
been  prisoner
among
the
apaches
had
escaped
came
on
to
frisco
found
that  had
given
him
up
for
dead
and
had
gone
to
england
followed
me
there
and
had
come
upon
me
at
last
on
the
very
morning
of
my
second
wedding  saw
it
in  paper
explained
the
american
it
gave
the
name
and
the
church
but
not
where
the
lady
lived
then
we
had  talk
as
to
what
we
should
do
and
frank
was
all
for
openness
but  was
so
ashamed
of
it
all
that  felt
as
if  should
like
to
vanish
away
and
never
see
any
of
them
again
just
sending  line
to
pa
perhaps
to
show
him
that  was
alive
it
was
awful
to
me
to
think
of
all
those
lords
and
ladies
sitting
round
that
breakfast
table
and
waiting
for
me
to
come
back
so
frank
took
my
wedding
clothes
and
things
and
made  bundle
of
them
so
that  should
not
be
traced
and
dropped
them
away
somewhere
where
no
one
could
find
them
it
is
likely
that
we
should
have
gone
on
to
paris
to
morrow
only
that
this
good
gentleman
mr
holmes
came
round
to
us
this
evening
though
how
he
found
us
is
more
than  can
think
and
he
showed
us
very
clearly
and
kindly
that  was
wrong
and
that
frank
was
right
and
that
we
should
be
putting
ourselves
in
the
wrong
if
we
were
so
secret
then
he
offered
to
give
us  chance
of
talking
to
lord
st
simon
alone
and
so
we
came
right
away
round
to
his
rooms
at
once
now
robert
you
have
heard
it
all
and  am
very
sorry
if  have
given
you
pain
and  hope
that
you
do
not
think
very
meanly
of
me
lord
st
simon
had
by
no
means
relaxed
his
rigid
attitude
but
had
listened
with  frowning
brow
and  compressed
lip
to
this
long
narrative
excuse
me
he
said
but
it
is
not
my
custom
to
discuss
my
most
intimate
personal
affairs
in
this
public
manner
then
you
won  forgive
me
you
won  shake
hands
before  go
oh
certainly
if
it
would
give
you
any
pleasure
he
put
out
his
hand
and
coldly
grasped
that
which
she
extended
to
him  had
hoped
suggested
holmes
that
you
would
have
joined
us
in  friendly
supper  think
that
there
you
ask  little
too
much
responded
his
lordship  may
be
forced
to
acquiesce
in
these
recent
developments
but  can
hardly
be
expected
to
make
merry
over
them  think
that
with
your
permission  will
now
wish
you
all  very
good
night
he
included
us
all
in  sweeping
bow
and
stalked
out
of
the
room
then  trust
that
you
at
least
will
honour
me
with
your
company
said
sherlock
holmes
it
is
always  joy
to
meet
an
american
mr
moulton
for  am
one
of
those
who
believe
that
the
folly
of  monarch
and
the
blundering
of  minister
in
far
gone
years
will
not
prevent
our
children
from
being
some
day
citizens
of
the
same
world
wide
country
under  flag
which
shall
be  quartering
of
the
union
jack
with
the
stars
and
stripes
the
case
has
been
an
interesting
one
remarked
holmes
when
our
visitors
had
left
us
because
it
serves
to
show
very
clearly
how
simple
the
explanation
may
be
of
an
affair
which
at
first
sight
seems
to
be
almost
inexplicable
nothing
could
be
more
natural
than
the
sequence
of
events
as
narrated
by
this
lady
and
nothing
stranger
than
the
result
when
viewed
for
instance
by
mr
lestrade
of
scotland
yard
you
were
not
yourself
at
fault
at
all
then
from
the
first
two
facts
were
very
obvious
to
me
the
one
that
the
lady
had
been
quite
willing
to
undergo
the
wedding
ceremony
the
other
that
she
had
repented
of
it
within  few
minutes
of
returning
home
obviously
something
had
occurred
during
the
morning
then
to
cause
her
to
change
her
mind
what
could
that
something
be
she
could
not
have
spoken
to
anyone
when
she
was
out
for
she
had
been
in
the
company
of
the
bridegroom
had
she
seen
someone
then
if
she
had
it
must
be
someone
from
america
because
she
had
spent
so
short  time
in
this
country
that
she
could
hardly
have
allowed
anyone
to
acquire
so
deep
an
influence
over
her
that
the
mere
sight
of
him
would
induce
her
to
change
her
plans
so
completely
you
see
we
have
already
arrived
by  process
of
exclusion
at
the
idea
that
she
might
have
seen
an
american
then
who
could
this
american
be
and
why
should
he
possess
so
much
influence
over
her
it
might
be  lover
it
might
be  husband
her
young
womanhood
had  knew
been
spent
in
rough
scenes
and
under
strange
conditions
so
far  had
got
before  ever
heard
lord
st
simon  narrative
when
he
told
us
of  man
in  pew
of
the
change
in
the
bride  manner
of
so
transparent  device
for
obtaining  note
as
the
dropping
of  bouquet
of
her
resort
to
her
confidential
maid
and
of
her
very
significant
allusion
to
claim
jumping
which
in
miners
parlance
means
taking
possession
of
that
which
another
person
has  prior
claim
to
the
whole
situation
became
absolutely
clear
she
had
gone
off
with  man
and
the
man
was
either  lover
or
was  previous
husband
the
chances
being
in
favour
of
the
latter
and
how
in
the
world
did
you
find
them
it
might
have
been
difficult
but
friend
lestrade
held
information
in
his
hands
the
value
of
which
he
did
not
himself
know
the
initials
were
of
course
of
the
highest
importance
but
more
valuable
still
was
it
to
know
that
within  week
he
had
settled
his
bill
at
one
of
the
most
select
london
hotels
how
did
you
deduce
the
select
by
the
select
prices
eight
shillings
for  bed
and
eightpence
for  glass
of
sherry
pointed
to
one
of
the
most
expensive
hotels
there
are
not
many
in
london
which
charge
at
that
rate
in
the
second
one
which  visited
in
northumberland
avenue  learned
by
an
inspection
of
the
book
that
francis  moulton
an
american
gentleman
had
left
only
the
day
before
and
on
looking
over
the
entries
against
him  came
upon
the
very
items
which  had
seen
in
the
duplicate
bill
his
letters
were
to
be
forwarded
to
gordon
square
so
thither  travelled
and
being
fortunate
enough
to
find
the
loving
couple
at
home  ventured
to
give
them
some
paternal
advice
and
to
point
out
to
them
that
it
would
be
better
in
every
way
that
they
should
make
their
position  little
clearer
both
to
the
general
public
and
to
lord
st
simon
in
particular  invited
them
to
meet
him
here
and
as
you
see  made
him
keep
the
appointment
but
with
no
very
good
result  remarked
his
conduct
was
certainly
not
very
gracious
ah
watson
said
holmes
smiling
perhaps
you
would
not
be
very
gracious
either
if
after
all
the
trouble
of
wooing
and
wedding
you
found
yourself
deprived
in
an
instant
of
wife
and
of
fortune  think
that
we
may
judge
lord
st
simon
very
mercifully
and
thank
our
stars
that
we
are
never
likely
to
find
ourselves
in
the
same
position
draw
your
chair
up
and
hand
me
my
violin
for
the
only
problem
we
have
still
to
solve
is
how
to
while
away
these
bleak
autumnal
evenings
xi
the
adventure
of
the
beryl
coronet
holmes
said  as  stood
one
morning
in
our
bow
window
looking
down
the
street
here
is  madman
coming
along
it
seems
rather
sad
that
his
relatives
should
allow
him
to
come
out
alone
my
friend
rose
lazily
from
his
armchair
and
stood
with
his
hands
in
the
pockets
of
his
dressing
gown
looking
over
my
shoulder
it
was  bright
crisp
february
morning
and
the
snow
of
the
day
before
still
lay
deep
upon
the
ground
shimmering
brightly
in
the
wintry
sun
down
the
centre
of
baker
street
it
had
been
ploughed
into  brown
crumbly
band
by
the
traffic
but
at
either
side
and
on
the
heaped
up
edges
of
the
foot
paths
it
still
lay
as
white
as
when
it
fell
the
grey
pavement
had
been
cleaned
and
scraped
but
was
still
dangerously
slippery
so
that
there
were
fewer
passengers
than
usual
indeed
from
the
direction
of
the
metropolitan
station
no
one
was
coming
save
the
single
gentleman
whose
eccentric
conduct
had
drawn
my
attention
he
was  man
of
about
fifty
tall
portly
and
imposing
with  massive
strongly
marked
face
and  commanding
figure
he
was
dressed
in  sombre
yet
rich
style
in
black
frock
coat
shining
hat
neat
brown
gaiters
and
well
cut
pearl
grey
trousers
yet
his
actions
were
in
absurd
contrast
to
the
dignity
of
his
dress
and
features
for
he
was
running
hard
with
occasional
little
springs
such
as  weary
man
gives
who
is
little
accustomed
to
set
any
tax
upon
his
legs
as
he
ran
he
jerked
his
hands
up
and
down
waggled
his
head
and
writhed
his
face
into
the
most
extraordinary
contortions
what
on
earth
can
be
the
matter
with
him  asked
he
is
looking
up
at
the
numbers
of
the
houses  believe
that
he
is
coming
here
said
holmes
rubbing
his
hands
here
yes  rather
think
he
is
coming
to
consult
me
professionally  think
that  recognise
the
symptoms
ha
did  not
tell
you
as
he
spoke
the
man
puffing
and
blowing
rushed
at
our
door
and
pulled
at
our
bell
until
the
whole
house
resounded
with
the
clanging  few
moments
later
he
was
in
our
room
still
puffing
still
gesticulating
but
with
so
fixed  look
of
grief
and
despair
in
his
eyes
that
our
smiles
were
turned
in
an
instant
to
horror
and
pity
for  while
he
could
not
get
his
words
out
but
swayed
his
body
and
plucked
at
his
hair
like
one
who
has
been
driven
to
the
extreme
limits
of
his
reason
then
suddenly
springing
to
his
feet
he
beat
his
head
against
the
wall
with
such
force
that
we
both
rushed
upon
him
and
tore
him
away
to
the
centre
of
the
room
sherlock
holmes
pushed
him
down
into
the
easy
chair
and
sitting
beside
him
patted
his
hand
and
chatted
with
him
in
the
easy
soothing
tones
which
he
knew
so
well
how
to
employ
you
have
come
to
me
to
tell
your
story
have
you
not
said
he
you
are
fatigued
with
your
haste
pray
wait
until
you
have
recovered
yourself
and
then  shall
be
most
happy
to
look
into
any
little
problem
which
you
may
submit
to
me
the
man
sat
for  minute
or
more
with  heaving
chest
fighting
against
his
emotion
then
he
passed
his
handkerchief
over
his
brow
set
his
lips
tight
and
turned
his
face
towards
us
no
doubt
you
think
me
mad
said
he  see
that
you
have
had
some
great
trouble
responded
holmes
god
knows  have  trouble
which
is
enough
to
unseat
my
reason
so
sudden
and
so
terrible
is
it
public
disgrace  might
have
faced
although  am  man
whose
character
has
never
yet
borne  stain
private
affliction
also
is
the
lot
of
every
man
but
the
two
coming
together
and
in
so
frightful  form
have
been
enough
to
shake
my
very
soul
besides
it
is
not  alone
the
very
noblest
in
the
land
may
suffer
unless
some
way
be
found
out
of
this
horrible
affair
pray
compose
yourself
sir
said
holmes
and
let
me
have  clear
account
of
who
you
are
and
what
it
is
that
has
befallen
you
my
name
answered
our
visitor
is
probably
familiar
to
your
ears  am
alexander
holder
of
the
banking
firm
of
holder
stevenson
of
threadneedle
street
the
name
was
indeed
well
known
to
us
as
belonging
to
the
senior
partner
in
the
second
largest
private
banking
concern
in
the
city
of
london
what
could
have
happened
then
to
bring
one
of
the
foremost
citizens
of
london
to
this
most
pitiable
pass
we
waited
all
curiosity
until
with
another
effort
he
braced
himself
to
tell
his
story  feel
that
time
is
of
value
said
he
that
is
why  hastened
here
when
the
police
inspector
suggested
that  should
secure
your
co
operation  came
to
baker
street
by
the
underground
and
hurried
from
there
on
foot
for
the
cabs
go
slowly
through
this
snow
that
is
why  was
so
out
of
breath
for  am  man
who
takes
very
little
exercise  feel
better
now
and  will
put
the
facts
before
you
as
shortly
and
yet
as
clearly
as  can
it
is
of
course
well
known
to
you
that
in  successful
banking
business
as
much
depends
upon
our
being
able
to
find
remunerative
investments
for
our
funds
as
upon
our
increasing
our
connection
and
the
number
of
our
depositors
one
of
our
most
lucrative
means
of
laying
out
money
is
in
the
shape
of
loans
where
the
security
is
unimpeachable
we
have
done  good
deal
in
this
direction
during
the
last
few
years
and
there
are
many
noble
families
to
whom
we
have
advanced
large
sums
upon
the
security
of
their
pictures
libraries
or
plate
yesterday
morning  was
seated
in
my
office
at
the
bank
when  card
was
brought
in
to
me
by
one
of
the
clerks  started
when  saw
the
name
for
it
was
that
of
none
other
than
well
perhaps
even
to
you  had
better
say
no
more
than
that
it
was  name
which
is  household
word
all
over
the
earth
one
of
the
highest
noblest
most
exalted
names
in
england  was
overwhelmed
by
the
honour
and
attempted
when
he
entered
to
say
so
but
he
plunged
at
once
into
business
with
the
air
of  man
who
wishes
to
hurry
quickly
through  disagreeable
task
mr
holder
said
he  have
been
informed
that
you
are
in
the
habit
of
advancing
money
the
firm
does
so
when
the
security
is
good  answered
it
is
absolutely
essential
to
me
said
he
that  should
have
at
once  could
of
course
borrow
so
trifling  sum
ten
times
over
from
my
friends
but  much
prefer
to
make
it  matter
of
business
and
to
carry
out
that
business
myself
in
my
position
you
can
readily
understand
that
it
is
unwise
to
place
one  self
under
obligations
for
how
long
may  ask
do
you
want
this
sum  asked
next
monday  have  large
sum
due
to
me
and  shall
then
most
certainly
repay
what
you
advance
with
whatever
interest
you
think
it
right
to
charge
but
it
is
very
essential
to
me
that
the
money
should
be
paid
at
once  should
be
happy
to
advance
it
without
further
parley
from
my
own
private
purse
said  were
it
not
that
the
strain
would
be
rather
more
than
it
could
bear
if
on
the
other
hand  am
to
do
it
in
the
name
of
the
firm
then
in
justice
to
my
partner  must
insist
that
even
in
your
case
every
businesslike
precaution
should
be
taken  should
much
prefer
to
have
it
so
said
he
raising
up  square
black
morocco
case
which
he
had
laid
beside
his
chair
you
have
doubtless
heard
of
the
beryl
coronet
one
of
the
most
precious
public
possessions
of
the
empire
said  precisely
he
opened
the
case
and
there
imbedded
in
soft
flesh
coloured
velvet
lay
the
magnificent
piece
of
jewellery
which
he
had
named
there
are
thirty
nine
enormous
beryls
said
he
and
the
price
of
the
gold
chasing
is
incalculable
the
lowest
estimate
would
put
the
worth
of
the
coronet
at
double
the
sum
which  have
asked  am
prepared
to
leave
it
with
you
as
my
security  took
the
precious
case
into
my
hands
and
looked
in
some
perplexity
from
it
to
my
illustrious
client
you
doubt
its
value
he
asked
not
at
all  only
doubt
the
propriety
of
my
leaving
it
you
may
set
your
mind
at
rest
about
that  should
not
dream
of
doing
so
were
it
not
absolutely
certain
that  should
be
able
in
four
days
to
reclaim
it
it
is  pure
matter
of
form
is
the
security
sufficient
ample
you
understand
mr
holder
that  am
giving
you  strong
proof
of
the
confidence
which  have
in
you
founded
upon
all
that  have
heard
of
you  rely
upon
you
not
only
to
be
discreet
and
to
refrain
from
all
gossip
upon
the
matter
but
above
all
to
preserve
this
coronet
with
every
possible
precaution
because  need
not
say
that  great
public
scandal
would
be
caused
if
any
harm
were
to
befall
it
any
injury
to
it
would
be
almost
as
serious
as
its
complete
loss
for
there
are
no
beryls
in
the
world
to
match
these
and
it
would
be
impossible
to
replace
them  leave
it
with
you
however
with
every
confidence
and  shall
call
for
it
in
person
on
monday
morning
seeing
that
my
client
was
anxious
to
leave  said
no
more
but
calling
for
my
cashier  ordered
him
to
pay
over
fifty
notes
when  was
alone
once
more
however
with
the
precious
case
lying
upon
the
table
in
front
of
me  could
not
but
think
with
some
misgivings
of
the
immense
responsibility
which
it
entailed
upon
me
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
as
it
was  national
possession  horrible
scandal
would
ensue
if
any
misfortune
should
occur
to
it  already
regretted
having
ever
consented
to
take
charge
of
it
however
it
was
too
late
to
alter
the
matter
now
so  locked
it
up
in
my
private
safe
and
turned
once
more
to
my
work
when
evening
came  felt
that
it
would
be
an
imprudence
to
leave
so
precious  thing
in
the
office
behind
me
bankers
safes
had
been
forced
before
now
and
why
should
not
mine
be
if
so
how
terrible
would
be
the
position
in
which  should
find
myself  determined
therefore
that
for
the
next
few
days  would
always
carry
the
case
backward
and
forward
with
me
so
that
it
might
never
be
really
out
of
my
reach
with
this
intention  called  cab
and
drove
out
to
my
house
at
streatham
carrying
the
jewel
with
me  did
not
breathe
freely
until  had
taken
it
upstairs
and
locked
it
in
the
bureau
of
my
dressing
room
and
now  word
as
to
my
household
mr
holmes
for  wish
you
to
thoroughly
understand
the
situation
my
groom
and
my
page
sleep
out
of
the
house
and
may
be
set
aside
altogether  have
three
maid
servants
who
have
been
with
me  number
of
years
and
whose
absolute
reliability
is
quite
above
suspicion
another
lucy
parr
the
second
waiting
maid
has
only
been
in
my
service  few
months
she
came
with
an
excellent
character
however
and
has
always
given
me
satisfaction
she
is  very
pretty
girl
and
has
attracted
admirers
who
have
occasionally
hung
about
the
place
that
is
the
only
drawback
which
we
have
found
to
her
but
we
believe
her
to
be  thoroughly
good
girl
in
every
way
so
much
for
the
servants
my
family
itself
is
so
small
that
it
will
not
take
me
long
to
describe
it  am  widower
and
have
an
only
son
arthur
he
has
been  disappointment
to
me
mr
holmes  grievous
disappointment  have
no
doubt
that  am
myself
to
blame
people
tell
me
that  have
spoiled
him
very
likely  have
when
my
dear
wife
died  felt
that
he
was
all  had
to
love  could
not
bear
to
see
the
smile
fade
even
for  moment
from
his
face  have
never
denied
him  wish
perhaps
it
would
have
been
better
for
both
of
us
had  been
sterner
but  meant
it
for
the
best
it
was
naturally
my
intention
that
he
should
succeed
me
in
my
business
but
he
was
not
of  business
turn
he
was
wild
wayward
and
to
speak
the
truth  could
not
trust
him
in
the
handling
of
large
sums
of
money
when
he
was
young
he
became  member
of
an
aristocratic
club
and
there
having
charming
manners
he
was
soon
the
intimate
of  number
of
men
with
long
purses
and
expensive
habits
he
learned
to
play
heavily
at
cards
and
to
squander
money
on
the
turf
until
he
had
again
and
again
to
come
to
me
and
implore
me
to
give
him
an
advance
upon
his
allowance
that
he
might
settle
his
debts
of
honour
he
tried
more
than
once
to
break
away
from
the
dangerous
company
which
he
was
keeping
but
each
time
the
influence
of
his
friend
sir
george
burnwell
was
enough
to
draw
him
back
again
and
indeed  could
not
wonder
that
such  man
as
sir
george
burnwell
should
gain
an
influence
over
him
for
he
has
frequently
brought
him
to
my
house
and  have
found
myself
that  could
hardly
resist
the
fascination
of
his
manner
he
is
older
than
arthur  man
of
the
world
to
his
finger
tips
one
who
had
been
everywhere
seen
everything  brilliant
talker
and  man
of
great
personal
beauty
yet
when  think
of
him
in
cold
blood
far
away
from
the
glamour
of
his
presence  am
convinced
from
his
cynical
speech
and
the
look
which  have
caught
in
his
eyes
that
he
is
one
who
should
be
deeply
distrusted
so  think
and
so
too
thinks
my
little
mary
who
has  woman  quick
insight
into
character
and
now
there
is
only
she
to
be
described
she
is
my
niece
but
when
my
brother
died
five
years
ago
and
left
her
alone
in
the
world  adopted
her
and
have
looked
upon
her
ever
since
as
my
daughter
she
is  sunbeam
in
my
house
sweet
loving
beautiful  wonderful
manager
and
housekeeper
yet
as
tender
and
quiet
and
gentle
as  woman
could
be
she
is
my
right
hand  do
not
know
what  could
do
without
her
in
only
one
matter
has
she
ever
gone
against
my
wishes
twice
my
boy
has
asked
her
to
marry
him
for
he
loves
her
devotedly
but
each
time
she
has
refused
him  think
that
if
anyone
could
have
drawn
him
into
the
right
path
it
would
have
been
she
and
that
his
marriage
might
have
changed
his
whole
life
but
now
alas
it
is
too
late
forever
too
late
now
mr
holmes
you
know
the
people
who
live
under
my
roof
and  shall
continue
with
my
miserable
story
when
we
were
taking
coffee
in
the
drawing
room
that
night
after
dinner  told
arthur
and
mary
my
experience
and
of
the
precious
treasure
which
we
had
under
our
roof
suppressing
only
the
name
of
my
client
lucy
parr
who
had
brought
in
the
coffee
had  am
sure
left
the
room
but  cannot
swear
that
the
door
was
closed
mary
and
arthur
were
much
interested
and
wished
to
see
the
famous
coronet
but  thought
it
better
not
to
disturb
it
where
have
you
put
it
asked
arthur
in
my
own
bureau
well  hope
to
goodness
the
house
won  be
burgled
during
the
night
said
he
it
is
locked
up  answered
oh
any
old
key
will
fit
that
bureau
when  was  youngster  have
opened
it
myself
with
the
key
of
the
box
room
cupboard
he
often
had  wild
way
of
talking
so
that  thought
little
of
what
he
said
he
followed
me
to
my
room
however
that
night
with  very
grave
face
look
here
dad
said
he
with
his
eyes
cast
down
can
you
let
me
have
no  cannot  answered
sharply  have
been
far
too
generous
with
you
in
money
matters
you
have
been
very
kind
said
he
but  must
have
this
money
or
else  can
never
show
my
face
inside
the
club
again
and  very
good
thing
too  cried
yes
but
you
would
not
have
me
leave
it  dishonoured
man
said
he  could
not
bear
the
disgrace  must
raise
the
money
in
some
way
and
if
you
will
not
let
me
have
it
then  must
try
other
means  was
very
angry
for
this
was
the
third
demand
during
the
month
you
shall
not
have  farthing
from
me  cried
on
which
he
bowed
and
left
the
room
without
another
word
when
he
was
gone  unlocked
my
bureau
made
sure
that
my
treasure
was
safe
and
locked
it
again
then  started
to
go
round
the
house
to
see
that
all
was
secure  duty
which  usually
leave
to
mary
but
which  thought
it
well
to
perform
myself
that
night
as  came
down
the
stairs  saw
mary
herself
at
the
side
window
of
the
hall
which
she
closed
and
fastened
as  approached
tell
me
dad
said
she
looking  thought  little
disturbed
did
you
give
lucy
the
maid
leave
to
go
out
to
night
certainly
not
she
came
in
just
now
by
the
back
door  have
no
doubt
that
she
has
only
been
to
the
side
gate
to
see
someone
but  think
that
it
is
hardly
safe
and
should
be
stopped
you
must
speak
to
her
in
the
morning
or  will
if
you
prefer
it
are
you
sure
that
everything
is
fastened
quite
sure
dad
then
good
night  kissed
her
and
went
up
to
my
bedroom
again
where  was
soon
asleep  am
endeavouring
to
tell
you
everything
mr
holmes
which
may
have
any
bearing
upon
the
case
but  beg
that
you
will
question
me
upon
any
point
which  do
not
make
clear
on
the
contrary
your
statement
is
singularly
lucid  come
to  part
of
my
story
now
in
which  should
wish
to
be
particularly
so  am
not  very
heavy
sleeper
and
the
anxiety
in
my
mind
tended
no
doubt
to
make
me
even
less
so
than
usual
about
two
in
the
morning
then  was
awakened
by
some
sound
in
the
house
it
had
ceased
ere  was
wide
awake
but
it
had
left
an
impression
behind
it
as
though  window
had
gently
closed
somewhere  lay
listening
with
all
my
ears
suddenly
to
my
horror
there
was  distinct
sound
of
footsteps
moving
softly
in
the
next
room  slipped
out
of
bed
all
palpitating
with
fear
and
peeped
round
the
corner
of
my
dressing
room
door
arthur  screamed
you
villain
you
thief
how
dare
you
touch
that
coronet
the
gas
was
half
up
as  had
left
it
and
my
unhappy
boy
dressed
only
in
his
shirt
and
trousers
was
standing
beside
the
light
holding
the
coronet
in
his
hands
he
appeared
to
be
wrenching
at
it
or
bending
it
with
all
his
strength
at
my
cry
he
dropped
it
from
his
grasp
and
turned
as
pale
as
death  snatched
it
up
and
examined
it
one
of
the
gold
corners
with
three
of
the
beryls
in
it
was
missing
you
blackguard  shouted
beside
myself
with
rage
you
have
destroyed
it
you
have
dishonoured
me
forever
where
are
the
jewels
which
you
have
stolen
stolen
he
cried
yes
thief  roared
shaking
him
by
the
shoulder
there
are
none
missing
there
cannot
be
any
missing
said
he
there
are
three
missing
and
you
know
where
they
are
must  call
you  liar
as
well
as  thief
did  not
see
you
trying
to
tear
off
another
piece
you
have
called
me
names
enough
said
he  will
not
stand
it
any
longer  shall
not
say
another
word
about
this
business
since
you
have
chosen
to
insult
me  will
leave
your
house
in
the
morning
and
make
my
own
way
in
the
world
you
shall
leave
it
in
the
hands
of
the
police  cried
half
mad
with
grief
and
rage  shall
have
this
matter
probed
to
the
bottom
you
shall
learn
nothing
from
me
said
he
with  passion
such
as  should
not
have
thought
was
in
his
nature
if
you
choose
to
call
the
police
let
the
police
find
what
they
can
by
this
time
the
whole
house
was
astir
for  had
raised
my
voice
in
my
anger
mary
was
the
first
to
rush
into
my
room
and
at
the
sight
of
the
coronet
and
of
arthur  face
she
read
the
whole
story
and
with  scream
fell
down
senseless
on
the
ground  sent
the
house
maid
for
the
police
and
put
the
investigation
into
their
hands
at
once
when
the
inspector
and  constable
entered
the
house
arthur
who
had
stood
sullenly
with
his
arms
folded
asked
me
whether
it
was
my
intention
to
charge
him
with
theft  answered
that
it
had
ceased
to
be  private
matter
but
had
become  public
one
since
the
ruined
coronet
was
national
property  was
determined
that
the
law
should
have
its
way
in
everything
at
least
said
he
you
will
not
have
me
arrested
at
once
it
would
be
to
your
advantage
as
well
as
mine
if  might
leave
the
house
for
five
minutes
that
you
may
get
away
or
perhaps
that
you
may
conceal
what
you
have
stolen
said  and
then
realising
the
dreadful
position
in
which  was
placed  implored
him
to
remember
that
not
only
my
honour
but
that
of
one
who
was
far
greater
than  was
at
stake
and
that
he
threatened
to
raise  scandal
which
would
convulse
the
nation
he
might
avert
it
all
if
he
would
but
tell
me
what
he
had
done
with
the
three
missing
stones
you
may
as
well
face
the
matter
said  you
have
been
caught
in
the
act
and
no
confession
could
make
your
guilt
more
heinous
if
you
but
make
such
reparation
as
is
in
your
power
by
telling
us
where
the
beryls
are
all
shall
be
forgiven
and
forgotten
keep
your
forgiveness
for
those
who
ask
for
it
he
answered
turning
away
from
me
with  sneer  saw
that
he
was
too
hardened
for
any
words
of
mine
to
influence
him
there
was
but
one
way
for
it  called
in
the
inspector
and
gave
him
into
custody  search
was
made
at
once
not
only
of
his
person
but
of
his
room
and
of
every
portion
of
the
house
where
he
could
possibly
have
concealed
the
gems
but
no
trace
of
them
could
be
found
nor
would
the
wretched
boy
open
his
mouth
for
all
our
persuasions
and
our
threats
this
morning
he
was
removed
to  cell
and  after
going
through
all
the
police
formalities
have
hurried
round
to
you
to
implore
you
to
use
your
skill
in
unravelling
the
matter
the
police
have
openly
confessed
that
they
can
at
present
make
nothing
of
it
you
may
go
to
any
expense
which
you
think
necessary  have
already
offered  reward
of
my
god
what
shall  do  have
lost
my
honour
my
gems
and
my
son
in
one
night
oh
what
shall  do
he
put  hand
on
either
side
of
his
head
and
rocked
himself
to
and
fro
droning
to
himself
like  child
whose
grief
has
got
beyond
words
sherlock
holmes
sat
silent
for
some
few
minutes
with
his
brows
knitted
and
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
fire
do
you
receive
much
company
he
asked
none
save
my
partner
with
his
family
and
an
occasional
friend
of
arthur  sir
george
burnwell
has
been
several
times
lately
no
one
else  think
do
you
go
out
much
in
society
arthur
does
mary
and  stay
at
home
we
neither
of
us
care
for
it
that
is
unusual
in  young
girl
she
is
of  quiet
nature
besides
she
is
not
so
very
young
she
is
four
and
twenty
this
matter
from
what
you
say
seems
to
have
been  shock
to
her
also
terrible
she
is
even
more
affected
than  you
have
neither
of
you
any
doubt
as
to
your
son  guilt
how
can
we
have
when  saw
him
with
my
own
eyes
with
the
coronet
in
his
hands  hardly
consider
that  conclusive
proof
was
the
remainder
of
the
coronet
at
all
injured
yes
it
was
twisted
do
you
not
think
then
that
he
might
have
been
trying
to
straighten
it
god
bless
you
you
are
doing
what
you
can
for
him
and
for
me
but
it
is
too
heavy  task
what
was
he
doing
there
at
all
if
his
purpose
were
innocent
why
did
he
not
say
so
precisely
and
if
it
were
guilty
why
did
he
not
invent  lie
his
silence
appears
to
me
to
cut
both
ways
there
are
several
singular
points
about
the
case
what
did
the
police
think
of
the
noise
which
awoke
you
from
your
sleep
they
considered
that
it
might
be
caused
by
arthur  closing
his
bedroom
door  likely
story
as
if  man
bent
on
felony
would
slam
his
door
so
as
to
wake  household
what
did
they
say
then
of
the
disappearance
of
these
gems
they
are
still
sounding
the
planking
and
probing
the
furniture
in
the
hope
of
finding
them
have
they
thought
of
looking
outside
the
house
yes
they
have
shown
extraordinary
energy
the
whole
garden
has
already
been
minutely
examined
now
my
dear
sir
said
holmes
is
it
not
obvious
to
you
now
that
this
matter
really
strikes
very
much
deeper
than
either
you
or
the
police
were
at
first
inclined
to
think
it
appeared
to
you
to
be  simple
case
to
me
it
seems
exceedingly
complex
consider
what
is
involved
by
your
theory
you
suppose
that
your
son
came
down
from
his
bed
went
at
great
risk
to
your
dressing
room
opened
your
bureau
took
out
your
coronet
broke
off
by
main
force  small
portion
of
it
went
off
to
some
other
place
concealed
three
gems
out
of
the
thirty
nine
with
such
skill
that
nobody
can
find
them
and
then
returned
with
the
other
thirty
six
into
the
room
in
which
he
exposed
himself
to
the
greatest
danger
of
being
discovered  ask
you
now
is
such  theory
tenable
but
what
other
is
there
cried
the
banker
with  gesture
of
despair
if
his
motives
were
innocent
why
does
he
not
explain
them
it
is
our
task
to
find
that
out
replied
holmes
so
now
if
you
please
mr
holder
we
will
set
off
for
streatham
together
and
devote
an
hour
to
glancing  little
more
closely
into
details
my
friend
insisted
upon
my
accompanying
them
in
their
expedition
which  was
eager
enough
to
do
for
my
curiosity
and
sympathy
were
deeply
stirred
by
the
story
to
which
we
had
listened  confess
that
the
guilt
of
the
banker  son
appeared
to
me
to
be
as
obvious
as
it
did
to
his
unhappy
father
but
still  had
such
faith
in
holmes
judgment
that  felt
that
there
must
be
some
grounds
for
hope
as
long
as
he
was
dissatisfied
with
the
accepted
explanation
he
hardly
spoke  word
the
whole
way
out
to
the
southern
suburb
but
sat
with
his
chin
upon
his
breast
and
his
hat
drawn
over
his
eyes
sunk
in
the
deepest
thought
our
client
appeared
to
have
taken
fresh
heart
at
the
little
glimpse
of
hope
which
had
been
presented
to
him
and
he
even
broke
into  desultory
chat
with
me
over
his
business
affairs  short
railway
journey
and  shorter
walk
brought
us
to
fairbank
the
modest
residence
of
the
great
financier
fairbank
was  good
sized
square
house
of
white
stone
standing
back  little
from
the
road  double
carriage
sweep
with  snow
clad
lawn
stretched
down
in
front
to
two
large
iron
gates
which
closed
the
entrance
on
the
right
side
was  small
wooden
thicket
which
led
into  narrow
path
between
two
neat
hedges
stretching
from
the
road
to
the
kitchen
door
and
forming
the
tradesmen  entrance
on
the
left
ran  lane
which
led
to
the
stables
and
was
not
itself
within
the
grounds
at
all
being  public
though
little
used
thoroughfare
holmes
left
us
standing
at
the
door
and
walked
slowly
all
round
the
house
across
the
front
down
the
tradesmen  path
and
so
round
by
the
garden
behind
into
the
stable
lane
so
long
was
he
that
mr
holder
and  went
into
the
dining
room
and
waited
by
the
fire
until
he
should
return
we
were
sitting
there
in
silence
when
the
door
opened
and  young
lady
came
in
she
was
rather
above
the
middle
height
slim
with
dark
hair
and
eyes
which
seemed
the
darker
against
the
absolute
pallor
of
her
skin  do
not
think
that  have
ever
seen
such
deadly
paleness
in  woman  face
her
lips
too
were
bloodless
but
her
eyes
were
flushed
with
crying
as
she
swept
silently
into
the
room
she
impressed
me
with  greater
sense
of
grief
than
the
banker
had
done
in
the
morning
and
it
was
the
more
striking
in
her
as
she
was
evidently  woman
of
strong
character
with
immense
capacity
for
self
restraint
disregarding
my
presence
she
went
straight
to
her
uncle
and
passed
her
hand
over
his
head
with  sweet
womanly
caress
you
have
given
orders
that
arthur
should
be
liberated
have
you
not
dad
she
asked
no
no
my
girl
the
matter
must
be
probed
to
the
bottom
but  am
so
sure
that
he
is
innocent
you
know
what
woman  instincts
are  know
that
he
has
done
no
harm
and
that
you
will
be
sorry
for
having
acted
so
harshly
why
is
he
silent
then
if
he
is
innocent
who
knows
perhaps
because
he
was
so
angry
that
you
should
suspect
him
how
could  help
suspecting
him
when  actually
saw
him
with
the
coronet
in
his
hand
oh
but
he
had
only
picked
it
up
to
look
at
it
oh
do
do
take
my
word
for
it
that
he
is
innocent
let
the
matter
drop
and
say
no
more
it
is
so
dreadful
to
think
of
our
dear
arthur
in
prison  shall
never
let
it
drop
until
the
gems
are
found
never
mary
your
affection
for
arthur
blinds
you
as
to
the
awful
consequences
to
me
far
from
hushing
the
thing
up  have
brought  gentleman
down
from
london
to
inquire
more
deeply
into
it
this
gentleman
she
asked
facing
round
to
me
no
his
friend
he
wished
us
to
leave
him
alone
he
is
round
in
the
stable
lane
now
the
stable
lane
she
raised
her
dark
eyebrows
what
can
he
hope
to
find
there
ah
this  suppose
is
he  trust
sir
that
you
will
succeed
in
proving
what  feel
sure
is
the
truth
that
my
cousin
arthur
is
innocent
of
this
crime  fully
share
your
opinion
and  trust
with
you
that
we
may
prove
it
returned
holmes
going
back
to
the
mat
to
knock
the
snow
from
his
shoes  believe  have
the
honour
of
addressing
miss
mary
holder
might  ask
you  question
or
two
pray
do
sir
if
it
may
help
to
clear
this
horrible
affair
up
you
heard
nothing
yourself
last
night
nothing
until
my
uncle
here
began
to
speak
loudly  heard
that
and  came
down
you
shut
up
the
windows
and
doors
the
night
before
did
you
fasten
all
the
windows
yes
were
they
all
fastened
this
morning
yes
you
have  maid
who
has  sweetheart  think
that
you
remarked
to
your
uncle
last
night
that
she
had
been
out
to
see
him
yes
and
she
was
the
girl
who
waited
in
the
drawing
room
and
who
may
have
heard
uncle  remarks
about
the
coronet  see
you
infer
that
she
may
have
gone
out
to
tell
her
sweetheart
and
that
the
two
may
have
planned
the
robbery
but
what
is
the
good
of
all
these
vague
theories
cried
the
banker
impatiently
when  have
told
you
that  saw
arthur
with
the
coronet
in
his
hands
wait  little
mr
holder
we
must
come
back
to
that
about
this
girl
miss
holder
you
saw
her
return
by
the
kitchen
door  presume
yes
when  went
to
see
if
the
door
was
fastened
for
the
night  met
her
slipping
in  saw
the
man
too
in
the
gloom
do
you
know
him
oh
yes
he
is
the
green
grocer
who
brings
our
vegetables
round
his
name
is
francis
prosper
he
stood
said
holmes
to
the
left
of
the
door
that
is
to
say
farther
up
the
path
than
is
necessary
to
reach
the
door
yes
he
did
and
he
is  man
with  wooden
leg
something
like
fear
sprang
up
in
the
young
lady  expressive
black
eyes
why
you
are
like  magician
said
she
how
do
you
know
that
she
smiled
but
there
was
no
answering
smile
in
holmes
thin
eager
face  should
be
very
glad
now
to
go
upstairs
said
he  shall
probably
wish
to
go
over
the
outside
of
the
house
again
perhaps  had
better
take  look
at
the
lower
windows
before  go
up
he
walked
swiftly
round
from
one
to
the
other
pausing
only
at
the
large
one
which
looked
from
the
hall
onto
the
stable
lane
this
he
opened
and
made  very
careful
examination
of
the
sill
with
his
powerful
magnifying
lens
now
we
shall
go
upstairs
said
he
at
last
the
banker  dressing
room
was  plainly
furnished
little
chamber
with  grey
carpet  large
bureau
and  long
mirror
holmes
went
to
the
bureau
first
and
looked
hard
at
the
lock
which
key
was
used
to
open
it
he
asked
that
which
my
son
himself
indicated
that
of
the
cupboard
of
the
lumber
room
have
you
it
here
that
is
it
on
the
dressing
table
sherlock
holmes
took
it
up
and
opened
the
bureau
it
is  noiseless
lock
said
he
it
is
no
wonder
that
it
did
not
wake
you
this
case  presume
contains
the
coronet
we
must
have  look
at
it
he
opened
the
case
and
taking
out
the
diadem
he
laid
it
upon
the
table
it
was  magnificent
specimen
of
the
jeweller  art
and
the
thirty
six
stones
were
the
finest
that  have
ever
seen
at
one
side
of
the
coronet
was  cracked
edge
where  corner
holding
three
gems
had
been
torn
away
now
mr
holder
said
holmes
here
is
the
corner
which
corresponds
to
that
which
has
been
so
unfortunately
lost
might  beg
that
you
will
break
it
off
the
banker
recoiled
in
horror  should
not
dream
of
trying
said
he
then  will
holmes
suddenly
bent
his
strength
upon
it
but
without
result  feel
it
give  little
said
he
but
though  am
exceptionally
strong
in
the
fingers
it
would
take
me
all
my
time
to
break
it
an
ordinary
man
could
not
do
it
now
what
do
you
think
would
happen
if  did
break
it
mr
holder
there
would
be  noise
like  pistol
shot
do
you
tell
me
that
all
this
happened
within  few
yards
of
your
bed
and
that
you
heard
nothing
of
it  do
not
know
what
to
think
it
is
all
dark
to
me
but
perhaps
it
may
grow
lighter
as
we
go
what
do
you
think
miss
holder  confess
that  still
share
my
uncle  perplexity
your
son
had
no
shoes
or
slippers
on
when
you
saw
him
he
had
nothing
on
save
only
his
trousers
and
shirt
thank
you
we
have
certainly
been
favoured
with
extraordinary
luck
during
this
inquiry
and
it
will
be
entirely
our
own
fault
if
we
do
not
succeed
in
clearing
the
matter
up
with
your
permission
mr
holder  shall
now
continue
my
investigations
outside
he
went
alone
at
his
own
request
for
he
explained
that
any
unnecessary
footmarks
might
make
his
task
more
difficult
for
an
hour
or
more
he
was
at
work
returning
at
last
with
his
feet
heavy
with
snow
and
his
features
as
inscrutable
as
ever  think
that  have
seen
now
all
that
there
is
to
see
mr
holder
said
he  can
serve
you
best
by
returning
to
my
rooms
but
the
gems
mr
holmes
where
are
they  cannot
tell
the
banker
wrung
his
hands  shall
never
see
them
again
he
cried
and
my
son
you
give
me
hopes
my
opinion
is
in
no
way
altered
then
for
god  sake
what
was
this
dark
business
which
was
acted
in
my
house
last
night
if
you
can
call
upon
me
at
my
baker
street
rooms
to
morrow
morning
between
nine
and
ten  shall
be
happy
to
do
what  can
to
make
it
clearer  understand
that
you
give
me
carte
blanche
to
act
for
you
provided
only
that  get
back
the
gems
and
that
you
place
no
limit
on
the
sum  may
draw  would
give
my
fortune
to
have
them
back
very
good  shall
look
into
the
matter
between
this
and
then
good
bye
it
is
just
possible
that  may
have
to
come
over
here
again
before
evening
it
was
obvious
to
me
that
my
companion  mind
was
now
made
up
about
the
case
although
what
his
conclusions
were
was
more
than  could
even
dimly
imagine
several
times
during
our
homeward
journey  endeavoured
to
sound
him
upon
the
point
but
he
always
glided
away
to
some
other
topic
until
at
last  gave
it
over
in
despair
it
was
not
yet
three
when
we
found
ourselves
in
our
rooms
once
more
he
hurried
to
his
chamber
and
was
down
again
in  few
minutes
dressed
as  common
loafer
with
his
collar
turned
up
his
shiny
seedy
coat
his
red
cravat
and
his
worn
boots
he
was  perfect
sample
of
the
class  think
that
this
should
do
said
he
glancing
into
the
glass
above
the
fireplace  only
wish
that
you
could
come
with
me
watson
but  fear
that
it
won  do  may
be
on
the
trail
in
this
matter
or  may
be
following  will  the
wisp
but  shall
soon
know
which
it
is  hope
that  may
be
back
in  few
hours
he
cut  slice
of
beef
from
the
joint
upon
the
sideboard
sandwiched
it
between
two
rounds
of
bread
and
thrusting
this
rude
meal
into
his
pocket
he
started
off
upon
his
expedition  had
just
finished
my
tea
when
he
returned
evidently
in
excellent
spirits
swinging
an
old
elastic
sided
boot
in
his
hand
he
chucked
it
down
into  corner
and
helped
himself
to  cup
of
tea  only
looked
in
as  passed
said
he  am
going
right
on
where
to
oh
to
the
other
side
of
the
west
end
it
may
be
some
time
before  get
back
don  wait
up
for
me
in
case  should
be
late
how
are
you
getting
on
oh
so
so
nothing
to
complain
of  have
been
out
to
streatham
since  saw
you
last
but  did
not
call
at
the
house
it
is  very
sweet
little
problem
and  would
not
have
missed
it
for  good
deal
however  must
not
sit
gossiping
here
but
must
get
these
disreputable
clothes
off
and
return
to
my
highly
respectable
self  could
see
by
his
manner
that
he
had
stronger
reasons
for
satisfaction
than
his
words
alone
would
imply
his
eyes
twinkled
and
there
was
even  touch
of
colour
upon
his
sallow
cheeks
he
hastened
upstairs
and  few
minutes
later  heard
the
slam
of
the
hall
door
which
told
me
that
he
was
off
once
more
upon
his
congenial
hunt  waited
until
midnight
but
there
was
no
sign
of
his
return
so  retired
to
my
room
it
was
no
uncommon
thing
for
him
to
be
away
for
days
and
nights
on
end
when
he
was
hot
upon  scent
so
that
his
lateness
caused
me
no
surprise  do
not
know
at
what
hour
he
came
in
but
when  came
down
to
breakfast
in
the
morning
there
he
was
with  cup
of
coffee
in
one
hand
and
the
paper
in
the
other
as
fresh
and
trim
as
possible
you
will
excuse
my
beginning
without
you
watson
said
he
but
you
remember
that
our
client
has
rather
an
early
appointment
this
morning
why
it
is
after
nine
now  answered  should
not
be
surprised
if
that
were
he  thought  heard  ring
it
was
indeed
our
friend
the
financier  was
shocked
by
the
change
which
had
come
over
him
for
his
face
which
was
naturally
of  broad
and
massive
mould
was
now
pinched
and
fallen
in
while
his
hair
seemed
to
me
at
least  shade
whiter
he
entered
with  weariness
and
lethargy
which
was
even
more
painful
than
his
violence
of
the
morning
before
and
he
dropped
heavily
into
the
armchair
which  pushed
forward
for
him  do
not
know
what  have
done
to
be
so
severely
tried
said
he
only
two
days
ago  was  happy
and
prosperous
man
without  care
in
the
world
now  am
left
to  lonely
and
dishonoured
age
one
sorrow
comes
close
upon
the
heels
of
another
my
niece
mary
has
deserted
me
deserted
you
yes
her
bed
this
morning
had
not
been
slept
in
her
room
was
empty
and  note
for
me
lay
upon
the
hall
table  had
said
to
her
last
night
in
sorrow
and
not
in
anger
that
if
she
had
married
my
boy
all
might
have
been
well
with
him
perhaps
it
was
thoughtless
of
me
to
say
so
it
is
to
that
remark
that
she
refers
in
this
note
my
dearest
uncle  feel
that  have
brought
trouble
upon
you
and
that
if  had
acted
differently
this
terrible
misfortune
might
never
have
occurred  cannot
with
this
thought
in
my
mind
ever
again
be
happy
under
your
roof
and  feel
that  must
leave
you
forever
do
not
worry
about
my
future
for
that
is
provided
for
and
above
all
do
not
search
for
me
for
it
will
be
fruitless
labour
and
an
ill
service
to
me
in
life
or
in
death  am
ever
your
loving
mary
what
could
she
mean
by
that
note
mr
holmes
do
you
think
it
points
to
suicide
no
no
nothing
of
the
kind
it
is
perhaps
the
best
possible
solution  trust
mr
holder
that
you
are
nearing
the
end
of
your
troubles
ha
you
say
so
you
have
heard
something
mr
holmes
you
have
learned
something
where
are
the
gems
you
would
not
think
apiece
an
excessive
sum
for
them  would
pay
ten
that
would
be
unnecessary
three
thousand
will
cover
the
matter
and
there
is  little
reward  fancy
have
you
your
check
book
here
is  pen
better
make
it
out
for
with  dazed
face
the
banker
made
out
the
required
check
holmes
walked
over
to
his
desk
took
out  little
triangular
piece
of
gold
with
three
gems
in
it
and
threw
it
down
upon
the
table
with  shriek
of
joy
our
client
clutched
it
up
you
have
it
he
gasped  am
saved  am
saved
the
reaction
of
joy
was
as
passionate
as
his
grief
had
been
and
he
hugged
his
recovered
gems
to
his
bosom
there
is
one
other
thing
you
owe
mr
holder
said
sherlock
holmes
rather
sternly
owe
he
caught
up  pen
name
the
sum
and  will
pay
it
no
the
debt
is
not
to
me
you
owe  very
humble
apology
to
that
noble
lad
your
son
who
has
carried
himself
in
this
matter
as  should
be
proud
to
see
my
own
son
do
should  ever
chance
to
have
one
then
it
was
not
arthur
who
took
them  told
you
yesterday
and  repeat
to
day
that
it
was
not
you
are
sure
of
it
then
let
us
hurry
to
him
at
once
to
let
him
know
that
the
truth
is
known
he
knows
it
already
when  had
cleared
it
all
up  had
an
interview
with
him
and
finding
that
he
would
not
tell
me
the
story  told
it
to
him
on
which
he
had
to
confess
that  was
right
and
to
add
the
very
few
details
which
were
not
yet
quite
clear
to
me
your
news
of
this
morning
however
may
open
his
lips
for
heaven  sake
tell
me
then
what
is
this
extraordinary
mystery  will
do
so
and  will
show
you
the
steps
by
which  reached
it
and
let
me
say
to
you
first
that
which
it
is
hardest
for
me
to
say
and
for
you
to
hear
there
has
been
an
understanding
between
sir
george
burnwell
and
your
niece
mary
they
have
now
fled
together
my
mary
impossible
it
is
unfortunately
more
than
possible
it
is
certain
neither
you
nor
your
son
knew
the
true
character
of
this
man
when
you
admitted
him
into
your
family
circle
he
is
one
of
the
most
dangerous
men
in
england  ruined
gambler
an
absolutely
desperate
villain  man
without
heart
or
conscience
your
niece
knew
nothing
of
such
men
when
he
breathed
his
vows
to
her
as
he
had
done
to  hundred
before
her
she
flattered
herself
that
she
alone
had
touched
his
heart
the
devil
knows
best
what
he
said
but
at
least
she
became
his
tool
and
was
in
the
habit
of
seeing
him
nearly
every
evening  cannot
and  will
not
believe
it
cried
the
banker
with
an
ashen
face  will
tell
you
then
what
occurred
in
your
house
last
night
your
niece
when
you
had
as
she
thought
gone
to
your
room
slipped
down
and
talked
to
her
lover
through
the
window
which
leads
into
the
stable
lane
his
footmarks
had
pressed
right
through
the
snow
so
long
had
he
stood
there
she
told
him
of
the
coronet
his
wicked
lust
for
gold
kindled
at
the
news
and
he
bent
her
to
his
will  have
no
doubt
that
she
loved
you
but
there
are
women
in
whom
the
love
of  lover
extinguishes
all
other
loves
and  think
that
she
must
have
been
one
she
had
hardly
listened
to
his
instructions
when
she
saw
you
coming
downstairs
on
which
she
closed
the
window
rapidly
and
told
you
about
one
of
the
servants
escapade
with
her
wooden
legged
lover
which
was
all
perfectly
true
your
boy
arthur
went
to
bed
after
his
interview
with
you
but
he
slept
badly
on
account
of
his
uneasiness
about
his
club
debts
in
the
middle
of
the
night
he
heard  soft
tread
pass
his
door
so
he
rose
and
looking
out
was
surprised
to
see
his
cousin
walking
very
stealthily
along
the
passage
until
she
disappeared
into
your
dressing
room
petrified
with
astonishment
the
lad
slipped
on
some
clothes
and
waited
there
in
the
dark
to
see
what
would
come
of
this
strange
affair
presently
she
emerged
from
the
room
again
and
in
the
light
of
the
passage
lamp
your
son
saw
that
she
carried
the
precious
coronet
in
her
hands
she
passed
down
the
stairs
and
he
thrilling
with
horror
ran
along
and
slipped
behind
the
curtain
near
your
door
whence
he
could
see
what
passed
in
the
hall
beneath
he
saw
her
stealthily
open
the
window
hand
out
the
coronet
to
someone
in
the
gloom
and
then
closing
it
once
more
hurry
back
to
her
room
passing
quite
close
to
where
he
stood
hid
behind
the
curtain
as
long
as
she
was
on
the
scene
he
could
not
take
any
action
without  horrible
exposure
of
the
woman
whom
he
loved
but
the
instant
that
she
was
gone
he
realised
how
crushing  misfortune
this
would
be
for
you
and
how
all
important
it
was
to
set
it
right
he
rushed
down
just
as
he
was
in
his
bare
feet
opened
the
window
sprang
out
into
the
snow
and
ran
down
the
lane
where
he
could
see  dark
figure
in
the
moonlight
sir
george
burnwell
tried
to
get
away
but
arthur
caught
him
and
there
was  struggle
between
them
your
lad
tugging
at
one
side
of
the
coronet
and
his
opponent
at
the
other
in
the
scuffle
your
son
struck
sir
george
and
cut
him
over
the
eye
then
something
suddenly
snapped
and
your
son
finding
that
he
had
the
coronet
in
his
hands
rushed
back
closed
the
window
ascended
to
your
room
and
had
just
observed
that
the
coronet
had
been
twisted
in
the
struggle
and
was
endeavouring
to
straighten
it
when
you
appeared
upon
the
scene
is
it
possible
gasped
the
banker
you
then
roused
his
anger
by
calling
him
names
at  moment
when
he
felt
that
he
had
deserved
your
warmest
thanks
he
could
not
explain
the
true
state
of
affairs
without
betraying
one
who
certainly
deserved
little
enough
consideration
at
his
hands
he
took
the
more
chivalrous
view
however
and
preserved
her
secret
and
that
was
why
she
shrieked
and
fainted
when
she
saw
the
coronet
cried
mr
holder
oh
my
god
what  blind
fool  have
been
and
his
asking
to
be
allowed
to
go
out
for
five
minutes
the
dear
fellow
wanted
to
see
if
the
missing
piece
were
at
the
scene
of
the
struggle
how
cruelly  have
misjudged
him
when  arrived
at
the
house
continued
holmes  at
once
went
very
carefully
round
it
to
observe
if
there
were
any
traces
in
the
snow
which
might
help
me  knew
that
none
had
fallen
since
the
evening
before
and
also
that
there
had
been  strong
frost
to
preserve
impressions  passed
along
the
tradesmen  path
but
found
it
all
trampled
down
and
indistinguishable
just
beyond
it
however
at
the
far
side
of
the
kitchen
door  woman
had
stood
and
talked
with  man
whose
round
impressions
on
one
side
showed
that
he
had  wooden
leg  could
even
tell
that
they
had
been
disturbed
for
the
woman
had
run
back
swiftly
to
the
door
as
was
shown
by
the
deep
toe
and
light
heel
marks
while
wooden
leg
had
waited  little
and
then
had
gone
away  thought
at
the
time
that
this
might
be
the
maid
and
her
sweetheart
of
whom
you
had
already
spoken
to
me
and
inquiry
showed
it
was
so  passed
round
the
garden
without
seeing
anything
more
than
random
tracks
which  took
to
be
the
police
but
when  got
into
the
stable
lane  very
long
and
complex
story
was
written
in
the
snow
in
front
of
me
there
was  double
line
of
tracks
of  booted
man
and  second
double
line
which  saw
with
delight
belonged
to  man
with
naked
feet  was
at
once
convinced
from
what
you
had
told
me
that
the
latter
was
your
son
the
first
had
walked
both
ways
but
the
other
had
run
swiftly
and
as
his
tread
was
marked
in
places
over
the
depression
of
the
boot
it
was
obvious
that
he
had
passed
after
the
other  followed
them
up
and
found
they
led
to
the
hall
window
where
boots
had
worn
all
the
snow
away
while
waiting
then  walked
to
the
other
end
which
was  hundred
yards
or
more
down
the
lane  saw
where
boots
had
faced
round
where
the
snow
was
cut
up
as
though
there
had
been  struggle
and
finally
where  few
drops
of
blood
had
fallen
to
show
me
that  was
not
mistaken
boots
had
then
run
down
the
lane
and
another
little
smudge
of
blood
showed
that
it
was
he
who
had
been
hurt
when
he
came
to
the
highroad
at
the
other
end  found
that
the
pavement
had
been
cleared
so
there
was
an
end
to
that
clue
on
entering
the
house
however  examined
as
you
remember
the
sill
and
framework
of
the
hall
window
with
my
lens
and  could
at
once
see
that
someone
had
passed
out  could
distinguish
the
outline
of
an
instep
where
the
wet
foot
had
been
placed
in
coming
in  was
then
beginning
to
be
able
to
form
an
opinion
as
to
what
had
occurred  man
had
waited
outside
the
window
someone
had
brought
the
gems
the
deed
had
been
overseen
by
your
son
he
had
pursued
the
thief
had
struggled
with
him
they
had
each
tugged
at
the
coronet
their
united
strength
causing
injuries
which
neither
alone
could
have
effected
he
had
returned
with
the
prize
but
had
left  fragment
in
the
grasp
of
his
opponent
so
far  was
clear
the
question
now
was
who
was
the
man
and
who
was
it
brought
him
the
coronet
it
is
an
old
maxim
of
mine
that
when
you
have
excluded
the
impossible
whatever
remains
however
improbable
must
be
the
truth
now  knew
that
it
was
not
you
who
had
brought
it
down
so
there
only
remained
your
niece
and
the
maids
but
if
it
were
the
maids
why
should
your
son
allow
himself
to
be
accused
in
their
place
there
could
be
no
possible
reason
as
he
loved
his
cousin
however
there
was
an
excellent
explanation
why
he
should
retain
her
secret
the
more
so
as
the
secret
was  disgraceful
one
when  remembered
that
you
had
seen
her
at
that
window
and
how
she
had
fainted
on
seeing
the
coronet
again
my
conjecture
became  certainty
and
who
could
it
be
who
was
her
confederate  lover
evidently
for
who
else
could
outweigh
the
love
and
gratitude
which
she
must
feel
to
you  knew
that
you
went
out
little
and
that
your
circle
of
friends
was  very
limited
one
but
among
them
was
sir
george
burnwell  had
heard
of
him
before
as
being  man
of
evil
reputation
among
women
it
must
have
been
he
who
wore
those
boots
and
retained
the
missing
gems
even
though
he
knew
that
arthur
had
discovered
him
he
might
still
flatter
himself
that
he
was
safe
for
the
lad
could
not
say  word
without
compromising
his
own
family
well
your
own
good
sense
will
suggest
what
measures  took
next  went
in
the
shape
of  loafer
to
sir
george  house
managed
to
pick
up
an
acquaintance
with
his
valet
learned
that
his
master
had
cut
his
head
the
night
before
and
finally
at
the
expense
of
six
shillings
made
all
sure
by
buying  pair
of
his
cast
off
shoes
with
these  journeyed
down
to
streatham
and
saw
that
they
exactly
fitted
the
tracks  saw
an
ill
dressed
vagabond
in
the
lane
yesterday
evening
said
mr
holder
precisely
it
was  i
found
that  had
my
man
so  came
home
and
changed
my
clothes
it
was  delicate
part
which  had
to
play
then
for  saw
that  prosecution
must
be
avoided
to
avert
scandal
and  knew
that
so
astute  villain
would
see
that
our
hands
were
tied
in
the
matter  went
and
saw
him
at
first
of
course
he
denied
everything
but
when  gave
him
every
particular
that
had
occurred
he
tried
to
bluster
and
took
down  life
preserver
from
the
wall  knew
my
man
however
and  clapped  pistol
to
his
head
before
he
could
strike
then
he
became  little
more
reasonable  told
him
that
we
would
give
him  price
for
the
stones
he
held
apiece
that
brought
out
the
first
signs
of
grief
that
he
had
shown
why
dash
it
all
said
he  ve
let
them
go
at
six
hundred
for
the
three  soon
managed
to
get
the
address
of
the
receiver
who
had
them
on
promising
him
that
there
would
be
no
prosecution
off  set
to
him
and
after
much
chaffering  got
our
stones
at
apiece
then  looked
in
upon
your
son
told
him
that
all
was
right
and
eventually
got
to
my
bed
about
two  clock
after
what  may
call  really
hard
day  work  day
which
has
saved
england
from  great
public
scandal
said
the
banker
rising
sir  cannot
find
words
to
thank
you
but
you
shall
not
find
me
ungrateful
for
what
you
have
done
your
skill
has
indeed
exceeded
all
that  have
heard
of
it
and
now  must
fly
to
my
dear
boy
to
apologise
to
him
for
the
wrong
which  have
done
him
as
to
what
you
tell
me
of
poor
mary
it
goes
to
my
very
heart
not
even
your
skill
can
inform
me
where
she
is
now  think
that
we
may
safely
say
returned
holmes
that
she
is
wherever
sir
george
burnwell
is
it
is
equally
certain
too
that
whatever
her
sins
are
they
will
soon
receive  more
than
sufficient
punishment
xii
the
adventure
of
the
copper
beeches
to
the
man
who
loves
art
for
its
own
sake
remarked
sherlock
holmes
tossing
aside
the
advertisement
sheet
of
the
daily
telegraph
it
is
frequently
in
its
least
important
and
lowliest
manifestations
that
the
keenest
pleasure
is
to
be
derived
it
is
pleasant
to
me
to
observe
watson
that
you
have
so
far
grasped
this
truth
that
in
these
little
records
of
our
cases
which
you
have
been
good
enough
to
draw
up
and  am
bound
to
say
occasionally
to
embellish
you
have
given
prominence
not
so
much
to
the
many
causes
celebres
and
sensational
trials
in
which  have
figured
but
rather
to
those
incidents
which
may
have
been
trivial
in
themselves
but
which
have
given
room
for
those
faculties
of
deduction
and
of
logical
synthesis
which  have
made
my
special
province
and
yet
said  smiling  cannot
quite
hold
myself
absolved
from
the
charge
of
sensationalism
which
has
been
urged
against
my
records
you
have
erred
perhaps
he
observed
taking
up  glowing
cinder
with
the
tongs
and
lighting
with
it
the
long
cherry
wood
pipe
which
was
wont
to
replace
his
clay
when
he
was
in  disputatious
rather
than  meditative
mood
you
have
erred
perhaps
in
attempting
to
put
colour
and
life
into
each
of
your
statements
instead
of
confining
yourself
to
the
task
of
placing
upon
record
that
severe
reasoning
from
cause
to
effect
which
is
really
the
only
notable
feature
about
the
thing
it
seems
to
me
that  have
done
you
full
justice
in
the
matter  remarked
with
some
coldness
for  was
repelled
by
the
egotism
which  had
more
than
once
observed
to
be  strong
factor
in
my
friend  singular
character
no
it
is
not
selfishness
or
conceit
said
he
answering
as
was
his
wont
my
thoughts
rather
than
my
words
if  claim
full
justice
for
my
art
it
is
because
it
is
an
impersonal
thing  thing
beyond
myself
crime
is
common
logic
is
rare
therefore
it
is
upon
the
logic
rather
than
upon
the
crime
that
you
should
dwell
you
have
degraded
what
should
have
been  course
of
lectures
into  series
of
tales
it
was  cold
morning
of
the
early
spring
and
we
sat
after
breakfast
on
either
side
of  cheery
fire
in
the
old
room
at
baker
street  thick
fog
rolled
down
between
the
lines
of
dun
coloured
houses
and
the
opposing
windows
loomed
like
dark
shapeless
blurs
through
the
heavy
yellow
wreaths
our
gas
was
lit
and
shone
on
the
white
cloth
and
glimmer
of
china
and
metal
for
the
table
had
not
been
cleared
yet
sherlock
holmes
had
been
silent
all
the
morning
dipping
continuously
into
the
advertisement
columns
of  succession
of
papers
until
at
last
having
apparently
given
up
his
search
he
had
emerged
in
no
very
sweet
temper
to
lecture
me
upon
my
literary
shortcomings
at
the
same
time
he
remarked
after  pause
during
which
he
had
sat
puffing
at
his
long
pipe
and
gazing
down
into
the
fire
you
can
hardly
be
open
to  charge
of
sensationalism
for
out
of
these
cases
which
you
have
been
so
kind
as
to
interest
yourself
in  fair
proportion
do
not
treat
of
crime
in
its
legal
sense
at
all
the
small
matter
in
which  endeavoured
to
help
the
king
of
bohemia
the
singular
experience
of
miss
mary
sutherland
the
problem
connected
with
the
man
with
the
twisted
lip
and
the
incident
of
the
noble
bachelor
were
all
matters
which
are
outside
the
pale
of
the
law
but
in
avoiding
the
sensational  fear
that
you
may
have
bordered
on
the
trivial
the
end
may
have
been
so  answered
but
the
methods  hold
to
have
been
novel
and
of
interest
pshaw
my
dear
fellow
what
do
the
public
the
great
unobservant
public
who
could
hardly
tell  weaver
by
his
tooth
or  compositor
by
his
left
thumb
care
about
the
finer
shades
of
analysis
and
deduction
but
indeed
if
you
are
trivial  cannot
blame
you
for
the
days
of
the
great
cases
are
past
man
or
at
least
criminal
man
has
lost
all
enterprise
and
originality
as
to
my
own
little
practice
it
seems
to
be
degenerating
into
an
agency
for
recovering
lost
lead
pencils
and
giving
advice
to
young
ladies
from
boarding
schools  think
that  have
touched
bottom
at
last
however
this
note  had
this
morning
marks
my
zero
point  fancy
read
it
he
tossed  crumpled
letter
across
to
me
it
was
dated
from
montague
place
upon
the
preceding
evening
and
ran
thus
dear
mr
holmes  am
very
anxious
to
consult
you
as
to
whether  should
or
should
not
accept  situation
which
has
been
offered
to
me
as
governess  shall
call
at
half
past
ten
to
morrow
if  do
not
inconvenience
you
yours
faithfully
violet
hunter
do
you
know
the
young
lady  asked
not  it
is
half
past
ten
now
yes
and  have
no
doubt
that
is
her
ring
it
may
turn
out
to
be
of
more
interest
than
you
think
you
remember
that
the
affair
of
the
blue
carbuncle
which
appeared
to
be  mere
whim
at
first
developed
into  serious
investigation
it
may
be
so
in
this
case
also
well
let
us
hope
so
but
our
doubts
will
very
soon
be
solved
for
here
unless  am
much
mistaken
is
the
person
in
question
as
he
spoke
the
door
opened
and  young
lady
entered
the
room
she
was
plainly
but
neatly
dressed
with  bright
quick
face
freckled
like  plover  egg
and
with
the
brisk
manner
of  woman
who
has
had
her
own
way
to
make
in
the
world
you
will
excuse
my
troubling
you  am
sure
said
she
as
my
companion
rose
to
greet
her
but  have
had  very
strange
experience
and
as  have
no
parents
or
relations
of
any
sort
from
whom  could
ask
advice  thought
that
perhaps
you
would
be
kind
enough
to
tell
me
what  should
do
pray
take  seat
miss
hunter  shall
be
happy
to
do
anything
that  can
to
serve
you  could
see
that
holmes
was
favourably
impressed
by
the
manner
and
speech
of
his
new
client
he
looked
her
over
in
his
searching
fashion
and
then
composed
himself
with
his
lids
drooping
and
his
finger
tips
together
to
listen
to
her
story  have
been  governess
for
five
years
said
she
in
the
family
of
colonel
spence
munro
but
two
months
ago
the
colonel
received
an
appointment
at
halifax
in
nova
scotia
and
took
his
children
over
to
america
with
him
so
that  found
myself
without  situation  advertised
and  answered
advertisements
but
without
success
at
last
the
little
money
which  had
saved
began
to
run
short
and  was
at
my
wit  end
as
to
what  should
do
there
is  well
known
agency
for
governesses
in
the
west
end
called
westaway  and
there  used
to
call
about
once  week
in
order
to
see
whether
anything
had
turned
up
which
might
suit
me
westaway
was
the
name
of
the
founder
of
the
business
but
it
is
really
managed
by
miss
stoper
she
sits
in
her
own
little
office
and
the
ladies
who
are
seeking
employment
wait
in
an
anteroom
and
are
then
shown
in
one
by
one
when
she
consults
her
ledgers
and
sees
whether
she
has
anything
which
would
suit
them
well
when  called
last
week  was
shown
into
the
little
office
as
usual
but  found
that
miss
stoper
was
not
alone  prodigiously
stout
man
with  very
smiling
face
and  great
heavy
chin
which
rolled
down
in
fold
upon
fold
over
his
throat
sat
at
her
elbow
with  pair
of
glasses
on
his
nose
looking
very
earnestly
at
the
ladies
who
entered
as  came
in
he
gave
quite  jump
in
his
chair
and
turned
quickly
to
miss
stoper
that
will
do
said
he  could
not
ask
for
anything
better
capital
capital
he
seemed
quite
enthusiastic
and
rubbed
his
hands
together
in
the
most
genial
fashion
he
was
such  comfortable
looking
man
that
it
was
quite  pleasure
to
look
at
him
you
are
looking
for  situation
miss
he
asked
yes
sir
as
governess
yes
sir
and
what
salary
do
you
ask  had  month
in
my
last
place
with
colonel
spence
munro
oh
tut
tut
sweating
rank
sweating
he
cried
throwing
his
fat
hands
out
into
the
air
like  man
who
is
in  boiling
passion
how
could
anyone
offer
so
pitiful  sum
to  lady
with
such
attractions
and
accomplishments
my
accomplishments
sir
may
be
less
than
you
imagine
said  a
little
french  little
german
music
and
drawing
tut
tut
he
cried
this
is
all
quite
beside
the
question
the
point
is
have
you
or
have
you
not
the
bearing
and
deportment
of  lady
there
it
is
in  nutshell
if
you
have
not
you
are
not
fitted
for
the
rearing
of  child
who
may
some
day
play  considerable
part
in
the
history
of
the
country
but
if
you
have
why
then
how
could
any
gentleman
ask
you
to
condescend
to
accept
anything
under
the
three
figures
your
salary
with
me
madam
would
commence
at  year
you
may
imagine
mr
holmes
that
to
me
destitute
as  was
such
an
offer
seemed
almost
too
good
to
be
true
the
gentleman
however
seeing
perhaps
the
look
of
incredulity
upon
my
face
opened  pocket
book
and
took
out  note
it
is
also
my
custom
said
he
smiling
in
the
most
pleasant
fashion
until
his
eyes
were
just
two
little
shining
slits
amid
the
white
creases
of
his
face
to
advance
to
my
young
ladies
half
their
salary
beforehand
so
that
they
may
meet
any
little
expenses
of
their
journey
and
their
wardrobe
it
seemed
to
me
that  had
never
met
so
fascinating
and
so
thoughtful  man
as  was
already
in
debt
to
my
tradesmen
the
advance
was  great
convenience
and
yet
there
was
something
unnatural
about
the
whole
transaction
which
made
me
wish
to
know  little
more
before  quite
committed
myself
may  ask
where
you
live
sir
said  hampshire
charming
rural
place
the
copper
beeches
five
miles
on
the
far
side
of
winchester
it
is
the
most
lovely
country
my
dear
young
lady
and
the
dearest
old
country
house
and
my
duties
sir  should
be
glad
to
know
what
they
would
be
one
child
one
dear
little
romper
just
six
years
old
oh
if
you
could
see
him
killing
cockroaches
with  slipper
smack
smack
smack
three
gone
before
you
could
wink
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
laughed
his
eyes
into
his
head
again  was  little
startled
at
the
nature
of
the
child  amusement
but
the
father  laughter
made
me
think
that
perhaps
he
was
joking
my
sole
duties
then  asked
are
to
take
charge
of  single
child
no
no
not
the
sole
not
the
sole
my
dear
young
lady
he
cried
your
duty
would
be
as  am
sure
your
good
sense
would
suggest
to
obey
any
little
commands
my
wife
might
give
provided
always
that
they
were
such
commands
as  lady
might
with
propriety
obey
you
see
no
difficulty
heh  should
be
happy
to
make
myself
useful
quite
so
in
dress
now
for
example
we
are
faddy
people
you
know
faddy
but
kind
hearted
if
you
were
asked
to
wear
any
dress
which
we
might
give
you
you
would
not
object
to
our
little
whim
heh
no
said  considerably
astonished
at
his
words
or
to
sit
here
or
sit
there
that
would
not
be
offensive
to
you
oh
no
or
to
cut
your
hair
quite
short
before
you
come
to
us  could
hardly
believe
my
ears
as
you
may
observe
mr
holmes
my
hair
is
somewhat
luxuriant
and
of  rather
peculiar
tint
of
chestnut
it
has
been
considered
artistic  could
not
dream
of
sacrificing
it
in
this
offhand
fashion  am
afraid
that
that
is
quite
impossible
said  he
had
been
watching
me
eagerly
out
of
his
small
eyes
and  could
see  shadow
pass
over
his
face
as  spoke  am
afraid
that
it
is
quite
essential
said
he
it
is  little
fancy
of
my
wife  and
ladies
fancies
you
know
madam
ladies
fancies
must
be
consulted
and
so
you
won  cut
your
hair
no
sir  really
could
not  answered
firmly
ah
very
well
then
that
quite
settles
the
matter
it
is  pity
because
in
other
respects
you
would
really
have
done
very
nicely
in
that
case
miss
stoper  had
best
inspect  few
more
of
your
young
ladies
the
manageress
had
sat
all
this
while
busy
with
her
papers
without  word
to
either
of
us
but
she
glanced
at
me
now
with
so
much
annoyance
upon
her
face
that  could
not
help
suspecting
that
she
had
lost  handsome
commission
through
my
refusal
do
you
desire
your
name
to
be
kept
upon
the
books
she
asked
if
you
please
miss
stoper
well
really
it
seems
rather
useless
since
you
refuse
the
most
excellent
offers
in
this
fashion
said
she
sharply
you
can
hardly
expect
us
to
exert
ourselves
to
find
another
such
opening
for
you
good
day
to
you
miss
hunter
she
struck  gong
upon
the
table
and  was
shown
out
by
the
page
well
mr
holmes
when  got
back
to
my
lodgings
and
found
little
enough
in
the
cupboard
and
two
or
three
bills
upon
the
table  began
to
ask
myself
whether  had
not
done  very
foolish
thing
after
all
if
these
people
had
strange
fads
and
expected
obedience
on
the
most
extraordinary
matters
they
were
at
least
ready
to
pay
for
their
eccentricity
very
few
governesses
in
england
are
getting  year
besides
what
use
was
my
hair
to
me
many
people
are
improved
by
wearing
it
short
and
perhaps  should
be
among
the
number
next
day  was
inclined
to
think
that  had
made  mistake
and
by
the
day
after  was
sure
of
it  had
almost
overcome
my
pride
so
far
as
to
go
back
to
the
agency
and
inquire
whether
the
place
was
still
open
when  received
this
letter
from
the
gentleman
himself  have
it
here
and  will
read
it
to
you
the
copper
beeches
near
winchester
dear
miss
hunter
miss
stoper
has
very
kindly
given
me
your
address
and  write
from
here
to
ask
you
whether
you
have
reconsidered
your
decision
my
wife
is
very
anxious
that
you
should
come
for
she
has
been
much
attracted
by
my
description
of
you
we
are
willing
to
give  quarter
or  year
so
as
to
recompense
you
for
any
little
inconvenience
which
our
fads
may
cause
you
they
are
not
very
exacting
after
all
my
wife
is
fond
of  particular
shade
of
electric
blue
and
would
like
you
to
wear
such  dress
indoors
in
the
morning
you
need
not
however
go
to
the
expense
of
purchasing
one
as
we
have
one
belonging
to
my
dear
daughter
alice
now
in
philadelphia
which
would  should
think
fit
you
very
well
then
as
to
sitting
here
or
there
or
amusing
yourself
in
any
manner
indicated
that
need
cause
you
no
inconvenience
as
regards
your
hair
it
is
no
doubt  pity
especially
as  could
not
help
remarking
its
beauty
during
our
short
interview
but  am
afraid
that  must
remain
firm
upon
this
point
and  only
hope
that
the
increased
salary
may
recompense
you
for
the
loss
your
duties
as
far
as
the
child
is
concerned
are
very
light
now
do
try
to
come
and  shall
meet
you
with
the
dog
cart
at
winchester
let
me
know
your
train
yours
faithfully
jephro
rucastle
that
is
the
letter
which  have
just
received
mr
holmes
and
my
mind
is
made
up
that  will
accept
it  thought
however
that
before
taking
the
final
step  should
like
to
submit
the
whole
matter
to
your
consideration
well
miss
hunter
if
your
mind
is
made
up
that
settles
the
question
said
holmes
smiling
but
you
would
not
advise
me
to
refuse  confess
that
it
is
not
the
situation
which  should
like
to
see  sister
of
mine
apply
for
what
is
the
meaning
of
it
all
mr
holmes
ah  have
no
data  cannot
tell
perhaps
you
have
yourself
formed
some
opinion
well
there
seems
to
me
to
be
only
one
possible
solution
mr
rucastle
seemed
to
be  very
kind
good
natured
man
is
it
not
possible
that
his
wife
is  lunatic
that
he
desires
to
keep
the
matter
quiet
for
fear
she
should
be
taken
to
an
asylum
and
that
he
humours
her
fancies
in
every
way
in
order
to
prevent
an
outbreak
that
is  possible
solution
in
fact
as
matters
stand
it
is
the
most
probable
one
but
in
any
case
it
does
not
seem
to
be  nice
household
for  young
lady
but
the
money
mr
holmes
the
money
well
yes
of
course
the
pay
is
good
too
good
that
is
what
makes
me
uneasy
why
should
they
give
you  year
when
they
could
have
their
pick
for
there
must
be
some
strong
reason
behind  thought
that
if  told
you
the
circumstances
you
would
understand
afterwards
if  wanted
your
help  should
feel
so
much
stronger
if  felt
that
you
were
at
the
back
of
me
oh
you
may
carry
that
feeling
away
with
you  assure
you
that
your
little
problem
promises
to
be
the
most
interesting
which
has
come
my
way
for
some
months
there
is
something
distinctly
novel
about
some
of
the
features
if
you
should
find
yourself
in
doubt
or
in
danger
danger
what
danger
do
you
foresee
holmes
shook
his
head
gravely
it
would
cease
to
be  danger
if
we
could
define
it
said
he
but
at
any
time
day
or
night  telegram
would
bring
me
down
to
your
help
that
is
enough
she
rose
briskly
from
her
chair
with
the
anxiety
all
swept
from
her
face  shall
go
down
to
hampshire
quite
easy
in
my
mind
now  shall
write
to
mr
rucastle
at
once
sacrifice
my
poor
hair
to
night
and
start
for
winchester
to
morrow
with  few
grateful
words
to
holmes
she
bade
us
both
good
night
and
bustled
off
upon
her
way
at
least
said  as
we
heard
her
quick
firm
steps
descending
the
stairs
she
seems
to
be  young
lady
who
is
very
well
able
to
take
care
of
herself
and
she
would
need
to
be
said
holmes
gravely  am
much
mistaken
if
we
do
not
hear
from
her
before
many
days
are
past
it
was
not
very
long
before
my
friend  prediction
was
fulfilled  fortnight
went
by
during
which  frequently
found
my
thoughts
turning
in
her
direction
and
wondering
what
strange
side
alley
of
human
experience
this
lonely
woman
had
strayed
into
the
unusual
salary
the
curious
conditions
the
light
duties
all
pointed
to
something
abnormal
though
whether  fad
or  plot
or
whether
the
man
were  philanthropist
or  villain
it
was
quite
beyond
my
powers
to
determine
as
to
holmes  observed
that
he
sat
frequently
for
half
an
hour
on
end
with
knitted
brows
and
an
abstracted
air
but
he
swept
the
matter
away
with  wave
of
his
hand
when  mentioned
it
data
data
data
he
cried
impatiently  can  make
bricks
without
clay
and
yet
he
would
always
wind
up
by
muttering
that
no
sister
of
his
should
ever
have
accepted
such  situation
the
telegram
which
we
eventually
received
came
late
one
night
just
as  was
thinking
of
turning
in
and
holmes
was
settling
down
to
one
of
those
all
night
chemical
researches
which
he
frequently
indulged
in
when  would
leave
him
stooping
over  retort
and  test
tube
at
night
and
find
him
in
the
same
position
when  came
down
to
breakfast
in
the
morning
he
opened
the
yellow
envelope
and
then
glancing
at
the
message
threw
it
across
to
me
just
look
up
the
trains
in
bradshaw
said
he
and
turned
back
to
his
chemical
studies
the
summons
was  brief
and
urgent
one
please
be
at
the
black
swan
hotel
at
winchester
at
midday
to
morrow
it
said
do
come  am
at
my
wit  end
hunter
will
you
come
with
me
asked
holmes
glancing
up  should
wish
to
just
look
it
up
then
there
is  train
at
half
past
nine
said  glancing
over
my
bradshaw
it
is
due
at
winchester
at
that
will
do
very
nicely
then
perhaps  had
better
postpone
my
analysis
of
the
acetones
as
we
may
need
to
be
at
our
best
in
the
morning
by
eleven  clock
the
next
day
we
were
well
upon
our
way
to
the
old
english
capital
holmes
had
been
buried
in
the
morning
papers
all
the
way
down
but
after
we
had
passed
the
hampshire
border
he
threw
them
down
and
began
to
admire
the
scenery
it
was
an
ideal
spring
day  light
blue
sky
flecked
with
little
fleecy
white
clouds
drifting
across
from
west
to
east
the
sun
was
shining
very
brightly
and
yet
there
was
an
exhilarating
nip
in
the
air
which
set
an
edge
to  man  energy
all
over
the
countryside
away
to
the
rolling
hills
around
aldershot
the
little
red
and
grey
roofs
of
the
farm
steadings
peeped
out
from
amid
the
light
green
of
the
new
foliage
are
they
not
fresh
and
beautiful  cried
with
all
the
enthusiasm
of  man
fresh
from
the
fogs
of
baker
street
but
holmes
shook
his
head
gravely
do
you
know
watson
said
he
that
it
is
one
of
the
curses
of  mind
with  turn
like
mine
that  must
look
at
everything
with
reference
to
my
own
special
subject
you
look
at
these
scattered
houses
and
you
are
impressed
by
their
beauty  look
at
them
and
the
only
thought
which
comes
to
me
is  feeling
of
their
isolation
and
of
the
impunity
with
which
crime
may
be
committed
there
good
heavens  cried
who
would
associate
crime
with
these
dear
old
homesteads
they
always
fill
me
with  certain
horror
it
is
my
belief
watson
founded
upon
my
experience
that
the
lowest
and
vilest
alleys
in
london
do
not
present  more
dreadful
record
of
sin
than
does
the
smiling
and
beautiful
countryside
you
horrify
me
but
the
reason
is
very
obvious
the
pressure
of
public
opinion
can
do
in
the
town
what
the
law
cannot
accomplish
there
is
no
lane
so
vile
that
the
scream
of  tortured
child
or
the
thud
of  drunkard  blow
does
not
beget
sympathy
and
indignation
among
the
neighbours
and
then
the
whole
machinery
of
justice
is
ever
so
close
that  word
of
complaint
can
set
it
going
and
there
is
but  step
between
the
crime
and
the
dock
but
look
at
these
lonely
houses
each
in
its
own
fields
filled
for
the
most
part
with
poor
ignorant
folk
who
know
little
of
the
law
think
of
the
deeds
of
hellish
cruelty
the
hidden
wickedness
which
may
go
on
year
in
year
out
in
such
places
and
none
the
wiser
had
this
lady
who
appeals
to
us
for
help
gone
to
live
in
winchester  should
never
have
had  fear
for
her
it
is
the
five
miles
of
country
which
makes
the
danger
still
it
is
clear
that
she
is
not
personally
threatened
no
if
she
can
come
to
winchester
to
meet
us
she
can
get
away
quite
so
she
has
her
freedom
what
can
be
the
matter
then
can
you
suggest
no
explanation  have
devised
seven
separate
explanations
each
of
which
would
cover
the
facts
as
far
as
we
know
them
but
which
of
these
is
correct
can
only
be
determined
by
the
fresh
information
which
we
shall
no
doubt
find
waiting
for
us
well
there
is
the
tower
of
the
cathedral
and
we
shall
soon
learn
all
that
miss
hunter
has
to
tell
the
black
swan
is
an
inn
of
repute
in
the
high
street
at
no
distance
from
the
station
and
there
we
found
the
young
lady
waiting
for
us
she
had
engaged  sitting
room
and
our
lunch
awaited
us
upon
the
table  am
so
delighted
that
you
have
come
she
said
earnestly
it
is
so
very
kind
of
you
both
but
indeed  do
not
know
what  should
do
your
advice
will
be
altogether
invaluable
to
me
pray
tell
us
what
has
happened
to
you  will
do
so
and  must
be
quick
for  have
promised
mr
rucastle
to
be
back
before
three  got
his
leave
to
come
into
town
this
morning
though
he
little
knew
for
what
purpose
let
us
have
everything
in
its
due
order
holmes
thrust
his
long
thin
legs
out
towards
the
fire
and
composed
himself
to
listen
in
the
first
place  may
say
that  have
met
on
the
whole
with
no
actual
ill
treatment
from
mr
and
mrs
rucastle
it
is
only
fair
to
them
to
say
that
but  cannot
understand
them
and  am
not
easy
in
my
mind
about
them
what
can
you
not
understand
their
reasons
for
their
conduct
but
you
shall
have
it
all
just
as
it
occurred
when  came
down
mr
rucastle
met
me
here
and
drove
me
in
his
dog
cart
to
the
copper
beeches
it
is
as
he
said
beautifully
situated
but
it
is
not
beautiful
in
itself
for
it
is  large
square
block
of  house
whitewashed
but
all
stained
and
streaked
with
damp
and
bad
weather
there
are
grounds
round
it
woods
on
three
sides
and
on
the
fourth  field
which
slopes
down
to
the
southampton
highroad
which
curves
past
about  hundred
yards
from
the
front
door
this
ground
in
front
belongs
to
the
house
but
the
woods
all
round
are
part
of
lord
southerton  preserves  clump
of
copper
beeches
immediately
in
front
of
the
hall
door
has
given
its
name
to
the
place  was
driven
over
by
my
employer
who
was
as
amiable
as
ever
and
was
introduced
by
him
that
evening
to
his
wife
and
the
child
there
was
no
truth
mr
holmes
in
the
conjecture
which
seemed
to
us
to
be
probable
in
your
rooms
at
baker
street
mrs
rucastle
is
not
mad  found
her
to
be  silent
pale
faced
woman
much
younger
than
her
husband
not
more
than
thirty  should
think
while
he
can
hardly
be
less
than
forty
five
from
their
conversation  have
gathered
that
they
have
been
married
about
seven
years
that
he
was  widower
and
that
his
only
child
by
the
first
wife
was
the
daughter
who
has
gone
to
philadelphia
mr
rucastle
told
me
in
private
that
the
reason
why
she
had
left
them
was
that
she
had
an
unreasoning
aversion
to
her
stepmother
as
the
daughter
could
not
have
been
less
than
twenty  can
quite
imagine
that
her
position
must
have
been
uncomfortable
with
her
father  young
wife
mrs
rucastle
seemed
to
me
to
be
colourless
in
mind
as
well
as
in
feature
she
impressed
me
neither
favourably
nor
the
reverse
she
was  nonentity
it
was
easy
to
see
that
she
was
passionately
devoted
both
to
her
husband
and
to
her
little
son
her
light
grey
eyes
wandered
continually
from
one
to
the
other
noting
every
little
want
and
forestalling
it
if
possible
he
was
kind
to
her
also
in
his
bluff
boisterous
fashion
and
on
the
whole
they
seemed
to
be  happy
couple
and
yet
she
had
some
secret
sorrow
this
woman
she
would
often
be
lost
in
deep
thought
with
the
saddest
look
upon
her
face
more
than
once  have
surprised
her
in
tears  have
thought
sometimes
that
it
was
the
disposition
of
her
child
which
weighed
upon
her
mind
for  have
never
met
so
utterly
spoiled
and
so
ill
natured  little
creature
he
is
small
for
his
age
with  head
which
is
quite
disproportionately
large
his
whole
life
appears
to
be
spent
in
an
alternation
between
savage
fits
of
passion
and
gloomy
intervals
of
sulking
giving
pain
to
any
creature
weaker
than
himself
seems
to
be
his
one
idea
of
amusement
and
he
shows
quite
remarkable
talent
in
planning
the
capture
of
mice
little
birds
and
insects
but  would
rather
not
talk
about
the
creature
mr
holmes
and
indeed
he
has
little
to
do
with
my
story  am
glad
of
all
details
remarked
my
friend
whether
they
seem
to
you
to
be
relevant
or
not  shall
try
not
to
miss
anything
of
importance
the
one
unpleasant
thing
about
the
house
which
struck
me
at
once
was
the
appearance
and
conduct
of
the
servants
there
are
only
two  man
and
his
wife
toller
for
that
is
his
name
is  rough
uncouth
man
with
grizzled
hair
and
whiskers
and  perpetual
smell
of
drink
twice
since  have
been
with
them
he
has
been
quite
drunk
and
yet
mr
rucastle
seemed
to
take
no
notice
of
it
his
wife
is  very
tall
and
strong
woman
with  sour
face
as
silent
as
mrs
rucastle
and
much
less
amiable
they
are  most
unpleasant
couple
but
fortunately  spend
most
of
my
time
in
the
nursery
and
my
own
room
which
are
next
to
each
other
in
one
corner
of
the
building
for
two
days
after
my
arrival
at
the
copper
beeches
my
life
was
very
quiet
on
the
third
mrs
rucastle
came
down
just
after
breakfast
and
whispered
something
to
her
husband
oh
yes
said
he
turning
to
me
we
are
very
much
obliged
to
you
miss
hunter
for
falling
in
with
our
whims
so
far
as
to
cut
your
hair  assure
you
that
it
has
not
detracted
in
the
tiniest
iota
from
your
appearance
we
shall
now
see
how
the
electric
blue
dress
will
become
you
you
will
find
it
laid
out
upon
the
bed
in
your
room
and
if
you
would
be
so
good
as
to
put
it
on
we
should
both
be
extremely
obliged
the
dress
which  found
waiting
for
me
was
of  peculiar
shade
of
blue
it
was
of
excellent
material  sort
of
beige
but
it
bore
unmistakable
signs
of
having
been
worn
before
it
could
not
have
been  better
fit
if  had
been
measured
for
it
both
mr
and
mrs
rucastle
expressed  delight
at
the
look
of
it
which
seemed
quite
exaggerated
in
its
vehemence
they
were
waiting
for
me
in
the
drawing
room
which
is  very
large
room
stretching
along
the
entire
front
of
the
house
with
three
long
windows
reaching
down
to
the
floor  chair
had
been
placed
close
to
the
central
window
with
its
back
turned
towards
it
in
this  was
asked
to
sit
and
then
mr
rucastle
walking
up
and
down
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
began
to
tell
me  series
of
the
funniest
stories
that  have
ever
listened
to
you
cannot
imagine
how
comical
he
was
and  laughed
until  was
quite
weary
mrs
rucastle
however
who
has
evidently
no
sense
of
humour
never
so
much
as
smiled
but
sat
with
her
hands
in
her
lap
and  sad
anxious
look
upon
her
face
after
an
hour
or
so
mr
rucastle
suddenly
remarked
that
it
was
time
to
commence
the
duties
of
the
day
and
that  might
change
my
dress
and
go
to
little
edward
in
the
nursery
two
days
later
this
same
performance
was
gone
through
under
exactly
similar
circumstances
again  changed
my
dress
again  sat
in
the
window
and
again  laughed
very
heartily
at
the
funny
stories
of
which
my
employer
had
an
immense
repertoire
and
which
he
told
inimitably
then
he
handed
me  yellow
backed
novel
and
moving
my
chair  little
sideways
that
my
own
shadow
might
not
fall
upon
the
page
he
begged
me
to
read
aloud
to
him  read
for
about
ten
minutes
beginning
in
the
heart
of  chapter
and
then
suddenly
in
the
middle
of  sentence
he
ordered
me
to
cease
and
to
change
my
dress
you
can
easily
imagine
mr
holmes
how
curious  became
as
to
what
the
meaning
of
this
extraordinary
performance
could
possibly
be
they
were
always
very
careful  observed
to
turn
my
face
away
from
the
window
so
that  became
consumed
with
the
desire
to
see
what
was
going
on
behind
my
back
at
first
it
seemed
to
be
impossible
but  soon
devised  means
my
hand
mirror
had
been
broken
so  happy
thought
seized
me
and  concealed  piece
of
the
glass
in
my
handkerchief
on
the
next
occasion
in
the
midst
of
my
laughter  put
my
handkerchief
up
to
my
eyes
and
was
able
with  little
management
to
see
all
that
there
was
behind
me  confess
that  was
disappointed
there
was
nothing
at
least
that
was
my
first
impression
at
the
second
glance
however  perceived
that
there
was  man
standing
in
the
southampton
road  small
bearded
man
in  grey
suit
who
seemed
to
be
looking
in
my
direction
the
road
is
an
important
highway
and
there
are
usually
people
there
this
man
however
was
leaning
against
the
railings
which
bordered
our
field
and
was
looking
earnestly
up  lowered
my
handkerchief
and
glanced
at
mrs
rucastle
to
find
her
eyes
fixed
upon
me
with  most
searching
gaze
she
said
nothing
but  am
convinced
that
she
had
divined
that  had  mirror
in
my
hand
and
had
seen
what
was
behind
me
she
rose
at
once
jephro
said
she
there
is
an
impertinent
fellow
upon
the
road
there
who
stares
up
at
miss
hunter
no
friend
of
yours
miss
hunter
he
asked
no  know
no
one
in
these
parts
dear
me
how
very
impertinent
kindly
turn
round
and
motion
to
him
to
go
away
surely
it
would
be
better
to
take
no
notice
no
no
we
should
have
him
loitering
here
always
kindly
turn
round
and
wave
him
away
like
that  did
as  was
told
and
at
the
same
instant
mrs
rucastle
drew
down
the
blind
that
was  week
ago
and
from
that
time  have
not
sat
again
in
the
window
nor
have  worn
the
blue
dress
nor
seen
the
man
in
the
road
pray
continue
said
holmes
your
narrative
promises
to
be  most
interesting
one
you
will
find
it
rather
disconnected  fear
and
there
may
prove
to
be
little
relation
between
the
different
incidents
of
which  speak
on
the
very
first
day
that  was
at
the
copper
beeches
mr
rucastle
took
me
to  small
outhouse
which
stands
near
the
kitchen
door
as
we
approached
it  heard
the
sharp
rattling
of  chain
and
the
sound
as
of  large
animal
moving
about
look
in
here
said
mr
rucastle
showing
me  slit
between
two
planks
is
he
not  beauty  looked
through
and
was
conscious
of
two
glowing
eyes
and
of  vague
figure
huddled
up
in
the
darkness
don  be
frightened
said
my
employer
laughing
at
the
start
which  had
given
it  only
carlo
my
mastiff  call
him
mine
but
really
old
toller
my
groom
is
the
only
man
who
can
do
anything
with
him
we
feed
him
once  day
and
not
too
much
then
so
that
he
is
always
as
keen
as
mustard
toller
lets
him
loose
every
night
and
god
help
the
trespasser
whom
he
lays
his
fangs
upon
for
goodness
sake
don  you
ever
on
any
pretext
set
your
foot
over
the
threshold
at
night
for
it  as
much
as
your
life
is
worth
the
warning
was
no
idle
one
for
two
nights
later  happened
to
look
out
of
my
bedroom
window
about
two  clock
in
the
morning
it
was  beautiful
moonlight
night
and
the
lawn
in
front
of
the
house
was
silvered
over
and
almost
as
bright
as
day  was
standing
rapt
in
the
peaceful
beauty
of
the
scene
when  was
aware
that
something
was
moving
under
the
shadow
of
the
copper
beeches
as
it
emerged
into
the
moonshine  saw
what
it
was
it
was  giant
dog
as
large
as  calf
tawny
tinted
with
hanging
jowl
black
muzzle
and
huge
projecting
bones
it
walked
slowly
across
the
lawn
and
vanished
into
the
shadow
upon
the
other
side
that
dreadful
sentinel
sent  chill
to
my
heart
which  do
not
think
that
any
burglar
could
have
done
and
now  have  very
strange
experience
to
tell
you  had
as
you
know
cut
off
my
hair
in
london
and  had
placed
it
in  great
coil
at
the
bottom
of
my
trunk
one
evening
after
the
child
was
in
bed  began
to
amuse
myself
by
examining
the
furniture
of
my
room
and
by
rearranging
my
own
little
things
there
was
an
old
chest
of
drawers
in
the
room
the
two
upper
ones
empty
and
open
the
lower
one
locked  had
filled
the
first
two
with
my
linen
and
as  had
still
much
to
pack
away  was
naturally
annoyed
at
not
having
the
use
of
the
third
drawer
it
struck
me
that
it
might
have
been
fastened
by  mere
oversight
so  took
out
my
bunch
of
keys
and
tried
to
open
it
the
very
first
key
fitted
to
perfection
and  drew
the
drawer
open
there
was
only
one
thing
in
it
but  am
sure
that
you
would
never
guess
what
it
was
it
was
my
coil
of
hair  took
it
up
and
examined
it
it
was
of
the
same
peculiar
tint
and
the
same
thickness
but
then
the
impossibility
of
the
thing
obtruded
itself
upon
me
how
could
my
hair
have
been
locked
in
the
drawer
with
trembling
hands  undid
my
trunk
turned
out
the
contents
and
drew
from
the
bottom
my
own
hair  laid
the
two
tresses
together
and  assure
you
that
they
were
identical
was
it
not
extraordinary
puzzle
as  would  could
make
nothing
at
all
of
what
it
meant  returned
the
strange
hair
to
the
drawer
and  said
nothing
of
the
matter
to
the
rucastles
as  felt
that  had
put
myself
in
the
wrong
by
opening  drawer
which
they
had
locked  am
naturally
observant
as
you
may
have
remarked
mr
holmes
and  soon
had  pretty
good
plan
of
the
whole
house
in
my
head
there
was
one
wing
however
which
appeared
not
to
be
inhabited
at
all  door
which
faced
that
which
led
into
the
quarters
of
the
tollers
opened
into
this
suite
but
it
was
invariably
locked
one
day
however
as  ascended
the
stair  met
mr
rucastle
coming
out
through
this
door
his
keys
in
his
hand
and  look
on
his
face
which
made
him  very
different
person
to
the
round
jovial
man
to
whom  was
accustomed
his
cheeks
were
red
his
brow
was
all
crinkled
with
anger
and
the
veins
stood
out
at
his
temples
with
passion
he
locked
the
door
and
hurried
past
me
without  word
or  look
this
aroused
my
curiosity
so
when  went
out
for  walk
in
the
grounds
with
my
charge  strolled
round
to
the
side
from
which  could
see
the
windows
of
this
part
of
the
house
there
were
four
of
them
in  row
three
of
which
were
simply
dirty
while
the
fourth
was
shuttered
up
they
were
evidently
all
deserted
as  strolled
up
and
down
glancing
at
them
occasionally
mr
rucastle
came
out
to
me
looking
as
merry
and
jovial
as
ever
ah
said
he
you
must
not
think
me
rude
if  passed
you
without  word
my
dear
young
lady  was
preoccupied
with
business
matters  assured
him
that  was
not
offended
by
the
way
said  you
seem
to
have
quite  suite
of
spare
rooms
up
there
and
one
of
them
has
the
shutters
up
he
looked
surprised
and
as
it
seemed
to
me  little
startled
at
my
remark
photography
is
one
of
my
hobbies
said
he  have
made
my
dark
room
up
there
but
dear
me
what
an
observant
young
lady
we
have
come
upon
who
would
have
believed
it
who
would
have
ever
believed
it
he
spoke
in  jesting
tone
but
there
was
no
jest
in
his
eyes
as
he
looked
at
me  read
suspicion
there
and
annoyance
but
no
jest
well
mr
holmes
from
the
moment
that  understood
that
there
was
something
about
that
suite
of
rooms
which  was
not
to
know  was
all
on
fire
to
go
over
them
it
was
not
mere
curiosity
though  have
my
share
of
that
it
was
more  feeling
of
duty  feeling
that
some
good
might
come
from
my
penetrating
to
this
place
they
talk
of
woman  instinct
perhaps
it
was
woman  instinct
which
gave
me
that
feeling
at
any
rate
it
was
there
and  was
keenly
on
the
lookout
for
any
chance
to
pass
the
forbidden
door
it
was
only
yesterday
that
the
chance
came  may
tell
you
that
besides
mr
rucastle
both
toller
and
his
wife
find
something
to
do
in
these
deserted
rooms
and  once
saw
him
carrying  large
black
linen
bag
with
him
through
the
door
recently
he
has
been
drinking
hard
and
yesterday
evening
he
was
very
drunk
and
when  came
upstairs
there
was
the
key
in
the
door  have
no
doubt
at
all
that
he
had
left
it
there
mr
and
mrs
rucastle
were
both
downstairs
and
the
child
was
with
them
so
that  had
an
admirable
opportunity  turned
the
key
gently
in
the
lock
opened
the
door
and
slipped
through
there
was  little
passage
in
front
of
me
unpapered
and
uncarpeted
which
turned
at  right
angle
at
the
farther
end
round
this
corner
were
three
doors
in  line
the
first
and
third
of
which
were
open
they
each
led
into
an
empty
room
dusty
and
cheerless
with
two
windows
in
the
one
and
one
in
the
other
so
thick
with
dirt
that
the
evening
light
glimmered
dimly
through
them
the
centre
door
was
closed
and
across
the
outside
of
it
had
been
fastened
one
of
the
broad
bars
of
an
iron
bed
padlocked
at
one
end
to  ring
in
the
wall
and
fastened
at
the
other
with
stout
cord
the
door
itself
was
locked
as
well
and
the
key
was
not
there
this
barricaded
door
corresponded
clearly
with
the
shuttered
window
outside
and
yet  could
see
by
the
glimmer
from
beneath
it
that
the
room
was
not
in
darkness
evidently
there
was  skylight
which
let
in
light
from
above
as  stood
in
the
passage
gazing
at
the
sinister
door
and
wondering
what
secret
it
might
veil  suddenly
heard
the
sound
of
steps
within
the
room
and
saw  shadow
pass
backward
and
forward
against
the
little
slit
of
dim
light
which
shone
out
from
under
the
door  mad
unreasoning
terror
rose
up
in
me
at
the
sight
mr
holmes
my
overstrung
nerves
failed
me
suddenly
and  turned
and
ran
ran
as
though
some
dreadful
hand
were
behind
me
clutching
at
the
skirt
of
my
dress  rushed
down
the
passage
through
the
door
and
straight
into
the
arms
of
mr
rucastle
who
was
waiting
outside
so
said
he
smiling
it
was
you
then  thought
that
it
must
be
when  saw
the
door
open
oh  am
so
frightened  panted
my
dear
young
lady
my
dear
young
lady
you
cannot
think
how
caressing
and
soothing
his
manner
was
and
what
has
frightened
you
my
dear
young
lady
but
his
voice
was
just  little
too
coaxing
he
overdid
it  was
keenly
on
my
guard
against
him  was
foolish
enough
to
go
into
the
empty
wing  answered
but
it
is
so
lonely
and
eerie
in
this
dim
light
that  was
frightened
and
ran
out
again
oh
it
is
so
dreadfully
still
in
there
only
that
said
he
looking
at
me
keenly
why
what
did
you
think  asked
why
do
you
think
that  lock
this
door  am
sure
that  do
not
know
it
is
to
keep
people
out
who
have
no
business
there
do
you
see
he
was
still
smiling
in
the
most
amiable
manner  am
sure
if  had
known
well
then
you
know
now
and
if
you
ever
put
your
foot
over
that
threshold
again
here
in
an
instant
the
smile
hardened
into  grin
of
rage
and
he
glared
down
at
me
with
the
face
of  demon  ll
throw
you
to
the
mastiff  was
so
terrified
that  do
not
know
what  did  suppose
that  must
have
rushed
past
him
into
my
room  remember
nothing
until  found
myself
lying
on
my
bed
trembling
all
over
then  thought
of
you
mr
holmes  could
not
live
there
longer
without
some
advice  was
frightened
of
the
house
of
the
man
of
the
woman
of
the
servants
even
of
the
child
they
were
all
horrible
to
me
if  could
only
bring
you
down
all
would
be
well
of
course  might
have
fled
from
the
house
but
my
curiosity
was
almost
as
strong
as
my
fears
my
mind
was
soon
made
up  would
send
you  wire  put
on
my
hat
and
cloak
went
down
to
the
office
which
is
about
half  mile
from
the
house
and
then
returned
feeling
very
much
easier  horrible
doubt
came
into
my
mind
as  approached
the
door
lest
the
dog
might
be
loose
but  remembered
that
toller
had
drunk
himself
into  state
of
insensibility
that
evening
and  knew
that
he
was
the
only
one
in
the
household
who
had
any
influence
with
the
savage
creature
or
who
would
venture
to
set
him
free  slipped
in
in
safety
and
lay
awake
half
the
night
in
my
joy
at
the
thought
of
seeing
you  had
no
difficulty
in
getting
leave
to
come
into
winchester
this
morning
but  must
be
back
before
three  clock
for
mr
and
mrs
rucastle
are
going
on  visit
and
will
be
away
all
the
evening
so
that  must
look
after
the
child
now  have
told
you
all
my
adventures
mr
holmes
and  should
be
very
glad
if
you
could
tell
me
what
it
all
means
and
above
all
what  should
do
holmes
and  had
listened
spellbound
to
this
extraordinary
story
my
friend
rose
now
and
paced
up
and
down
the
room
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
an
expression
of
the
most
profound
gravity
upon
his
face
is
toller
still
drunk
he
asked
yes  heard
his
wife
tell
mrs
rucastle
that
she
could
do
nothing
with
him
that
is
well
and
the
rucastles
go
out
to
night
yes
is
there  cellar
with  good
strong
lock
yes
the
wine
cellar
you
seem
to
me
to
have
acted
all
through
this
matter
like  very
brave
and
sensible
girl
miss
hunter
do
you
think
that
you
could
perform
one
more
feat  should
not
ask
it
of
you
if  did
not
think
you  quite
exceptional
woman  will
try
what
is
it
we
shall
be
at
the
copper
beeches
by
seven  clock
my
friend
and  the
rucastles
will
be
gone
by
that
time
and
toller
will
we
hope
be
incapable
there
only
remains
mrs
toller
who
might
give
the
alarm
if
you
could
send
her
into
the
cellar
on
some
errand
and
then
turn
the
key
upon
her
you
would
facilitate
matters
immensely  will
do
it
excellent
we
shall
then
look
thoroughly
into
the
affair
of
course
there
is
only
one
feasible
explanation
you
have
been
brought
there
to
personate
someone
and
the
real
person
is
imprisoned
in
this
chamber
that
is
obvious
as
to
who
this
prisoner
is  have
no
doubt
that
it
is
the
daughter
miss
alice
rucastle
if  remember
right
who
was
said
to
have
gone
to
america
you
were
chosen
doubtless
as
resembling
her
in
height
figure
and
the
colour
of
your
hair
hers
had
been
cut
off
very
possibly
in
some
illness
through
which
she
has
passed
and
so
of
course
yours
had
to
be
sacrificed
also
by  curious
chance
you
came
upon
her
tresses
the
man
in
the
road
was
undoubtedly
some
friend
of
hers
possibly
her
fiance
and
no
doubt
as
you
wore
the
girl  dress
and
were
so
like
her
he
was
convinced
from
your
laughter
whenever
he
saw
you
and
afterwards
from
your
gesture
that
miss
rucastle
was
perfectly
happy
and
that
she
no
longer
desired
his
attentions
the
dog
is
let
loose
at
night
to
prevent
him
from
endeavouring
to
communicate
with
her
so
much
is
fairly
clear
the
most
serious
point
in
the
case
is
the
disposition
of
the
child
what
on
earth
has
that
to
do
with
it  ejaculated
my
dear
watson
you
as  medical
man
are
continually
gaining
light
as
to
the
tendencies
of  child
by
the
study
of
the
parents
don  you
see
that
the
converse
is
equally
valid  have
frequently
gained
my
first
real
insight
into
the
character
of
parents
by
studying
their
children
this
child  disposition
is
abnormally
cruel
merely
for
cruelty  sake
and
whether
he
derives
this
from
his
smiling
father
as  should
suspect
or
from
his
mother
it
bodes
evil
for
the
poor
girl
who
is
in
their
power  am
sure
that
you
are
right
mr
holmes
cried
our
client  thousand
things
come
back
to
me
which
make
me
certain
that
you
have
hit
it
oh
let
us
lose
not
an
instant
in
bringing
help
to
this
poor
creature
we
must
be
circumspect
for
we
are
dealing
with  very
cunning
man
we
can
do
nothing
until
seven  clock
at
that
hour
we
shall
be
with
you
and
it
will
not
be
long
before
we
solve
the
mystery
we
were
as
good
as
our
word
for
it
was
just
seven
when
we
reached
the
copper
beeches
having
put
up
our
trap
at  wayside
public
house
the
group
of
trees
with
their
dark
leaves
shining
like
burnished
metal
in
the
light
of
the
setting
sun
were
sufficient
to
mark
the
house
even
had
miss
hunter
not
been
standing
smiling
on
the
door
step
have
you
managed
it
asked
holmes  loud
thudding
noise
came
from
somewhere
downstairs
that
is
mrs
toller
in
the
cellar
said
she
her
husband
lies
snoring
on
the
kitchen
rug
here
are
his
keys
which
are
the
duplicates
of
mr
rucastle  you
have
done
well
indeed
cried
holmes
with
enthusiasm
now
lead
the
way
and
we
shall
soon
see
the
end
of
this
black
business
we
passed
up
the
stair
unlocked
the
door
followed
on
down  passage
and
found
ourselves
in
front
of
the
barricade
which
miss
hunter
had
described
holmes
cut
the
cord
and
removed
the
transverse
bar
then
he
tried
the
various
keys
in
the
lock
but
without
success
no
sound
came
from
within
and
at
the
silence
holmes
face
clouded
over  trust
that
we
are
not
too
late
said
he  think
miss
hunter
that
we
had
better
go
in
without
you
now
watson
put
your
shoulder
to
it
and
we
shall
see
whether
we
cannot
make
our
way
in
it
was
an
old
rickety
door
and
gave
at
once
before
our
united
strength
together
we
rushed
into
the
room
it
was
empty
there
was
no
furniture
save  little
pallet
bed  small
table
and  basketful
of
linen
the
skylight
above
was
open
and
the
prisoner
gone
there
has
been
some
villainy
here
said
holmes
this
beauty
has
guessed
miss
hunter  intentions
and
has
carried
his
victim
off
but
how
through
the
skylight
we
shall
soon
see
how
he
managed
it
he
swung
himself
up
onto
the
roof
ah
yes
he
cried
here  the
end
of  long
light
ladder
against
the
eaves
that
is
how
he
did
it
but
it
is
impossible
said
miss
hunter
the
ladder
was
not
there
when
the
rucastles
went
away
he
has
come
back
and
done
it  tell
you
that
he
is  clever
and
dangerous
man  should
not
be
very
much
surprised
if
this
were
he
whose
step  hear
now
upon
the
stair  think
watson
that
it
would
be
as
well
for
you
to
have
your
pistol
ready
the
words
were
hardly
out
of
his
mouth
before  man
appeared
at
the
door
of
the
room  very
fat
and
burly
man
with  heavy
stick
in
his
hand
miss
hunter
screamed
and
shrunk
against
the
wall
at
the
sight
of
him
but
sherlock
holmes
sprang
forward
and
confronted
him
you
villain
said
he
where  your
daughter
the
fat
man
cast
his
eyes
round
and
then
up
at
the
open
skylight
it
is
for
me
to
ask
you
that
he
shrieked
you
thieves
spies
and
thieves  have
caught
you
have  you
are
in
my
power  ll
serve
you
he
turned
and
clattered
down
the
stairs
as
hard
as
he
could
go
he  gone
for
the
dog
cried
miss
hunter  have
my
revolver
said  better
close
the
front
door
cried
holmes
and
we
all
rushed
down
the
stairs
together
we
had
hardly
reached
the
hall
when
we
heard
the
baying
of  hound
and
then  scream
of
agony
with  horrible
worrying
sound
which
it
was
dreadful
to
listen
to
an
elderly
man
with  red
face
and
shaking
limbs
came
staggering
out
at  side
door
my
god
he
cried
someone
has
loosed
the
dog
it  not
been
fed
for
two
days
quick
quick
or
it
ll
be
too
late
holmes
and  rushed
out
and
round
the
angle
of
the
house
with
toller
hurrying
behind
us
there
was
the
huge
famished
brute
its
black
muzzle
buried
in
rucastle  throat
while
he
writhed
and
screamed
upon
the
ground
running
up  blew
its
brains
out
and
it
fell
over
with
its
keen
white
teeth
still
meeting
in
the
great
creases
of
his
neck
with
much
labour
we
separated
them
and
carried
him
living
but
horribly
mangled
into
the
house
we
laid
him
upon
the
drawing
room
sofa
and
having
dispatched
the
sobered
toller
to
bear
the
news
to
his
wife  did
what  could
to
relieve
his
pain
we
were
all
assembled
round
him
when
the
door
opened
and  tall
gaunt
woman
entered
the
room
mrs
toller
cried
miss
hunter
yes
miss
mr
rucastle
let
me
out
when
he
came
back
before
he
went
up
to
you
ah
miss
it
is  pity
you
didn  let
me
know
what
you
were
planning
for  would
have
told
you
that
your
pains
were
wasted
ha
said
holmes
looking
keenly
at
her
it
is
clear
that
mrs
toller
knows
more
about
this
matter
than
anyone
else
yes
sir  do
and  am
ready
enough
to
tell
what  know
then
pray
sit
down
and
let
us
hear
it
for
there
are
several
points
on
which  must
confess
that  am
still
in
the
dark  will
soon
make
it
clear
to
you
said
she
and  d
have
done
so
before
now
if  could
ha
got
out
from
the
cellar
if
there  police
court
business
over
this
you
ll
remember
that  was
the
one
that
stood
your
friend
and
that  was
miss
alice  friend
too
she
was
never
happy
at
home
miss
alice
wasn  from
the
time
that
her
father
married
again
she
was
slighted
like
and
had
no
say
in
anything
but
it
never
really
became
bad
for
her
until
after
she
met
mr
fowler
at  friend  house
as
well
as  could
learn
miss
alice
had
rights
of
her
own
by
will
but
she
was
so
quiet
and
patient
she
was
that
she
never
said  word
about
them
but
just
left
everything
in
mr
rucastle  hands
he
knew
he
was
safe
with
her
but
when
there
was  chance
of  husband
coming
forward
who
would
ask
for
all
that
the
law
would
give
him
then
her
father
thought
it
time
to
put  stop
on
it
he
wanted
her
to
sign  paper
so
that
whether
she
married
or
not
he
could
use
her
money
when
she
wouldn  do
it
he
kept
on
worrying
her
until
she
got
brain
fever
and
for
six
weeks
was
at
death  door
then
she
got
better
at
last
all
worn
to  shadow
and
with
her
beautiful
hair
cut
off
but
that
didn  make
no
change
in
her
young
man
and
he
stuck
to
her
as
true
as
man
could
be
ah
said
holmes  think
that
what
you
have
been
good
enough
to
tell
us
makes
the
matter
fairly
clear
and
that  can
deduce
all
that
remains
mr
rucastle
then  presume
took
to
this
system
of
imprisonment
yes
sir
and
brought
miss
hunter
down
from
london
in
order
to
get
rid
of
the
disagreeable
persistence
of
mr
fowler
that
was
it
sir
but
mr
fowler
being  persevering
man
as  good
seaman
should
be
blockaded
the
house
and
having
met
you
succeeded
by
certain
arguments
metallic
or
otherwise
in
convincing
you
that
your
interests
were
the
same
as
his
mr
fowler
was  very
kind
spoken
free
handed
gentleman
said
mrs
toller
serenely
and
in
this
way
he
managed
that
your
good
man
should
have
no
want
of
drink
and
that  ladder
should
be
ready
at
the
moment
when
your
master
had
gone
out
you
have
it
sir
just
as
it
happened  am
sure
we
owe
you
an
apology
mrs
toller
said
holmes
for
you
have
certainly
cleared
up
everything
which
puzzled
us
and
here
comes
the
country
surgeon
and
mrs
rucastle
so  think
watson
that
we
had
best
escort
miss
hunter
back
to
winchester
as
it
seems
to
me
that
our
locus
standi
now
is
rather  questionable
one
and
thus
was
solved
the
mystery
of
the
sinister
house
with
the
copper
beeches
in
front
of
the
door
mr
rucastle
survived
but
was
always  broken
man
kept
alive
solely
through
the
care
of
his
devoted
wife
they
still
live
with
their
old
servants
who
probably
know
so
much
of
rucastle  past
life
that
he
finds
it
difficult
to
part
from
them
mr
fowler
and
miss
rucastle
were
married
by
special
license
in
southampton
the
day
after
their
flight
and
he
is
now
the
holder
of  government
appointment
in
the
island
of
mauritius
as
to
miss
violet
hunter
my
friend
holmes
rather
to
my
disappointment
manifested
no
further
interest
in
her
when
once
she
had
ceased
to
be
the
centre
of
one
of
his
problems
and
she
is
now
the
head
of  private
school
at
walsall
where  believe
that
she
has
met
with
considerable
success

mass  s  preface
as
things
now
stand
the
course
of
instruction
in
american
history
in
our
public
schools
embraces
three
distinct
treatments
of
the
subject
three
separate
books
are
used
first
there
is
the
primary
book
which
is
usually  very
condensed
narrative
with
emphasis
on
biographies
and
anecdotes
second
there
is
the
advanced
text
for
the
seventh
or
eighth
grade
generally
speaking
an
expansion
of
the
elementary
book
by
the
addition
of
forty
or
fifty
thousand
words
finally
there
is
the
high
school
manual
this
too
ordinarily
follows
the
beaten
path
giving
fuller
accounts
of
the
same
events
and
characters
to
put
it
bluntly
we
do
not
assume
that
our
children
obtain
permanent
possessions
from
their
study
of
history
in
the
lower
grades
if
mathematicians
followed
the
same
method
high
school
texts
on
algebra
and
geometry
would
include
the
multiplication
table
and
fractions
there
is
of
course  ready
answer
to
the
criticism
advanced
above
it
is
that
teachers
have
learned
from
bitter
experience
how
little
history
their
pupils
retain
as
they
pass
along
the
regular
route
no
teacher
of
history
will
deny
this
still
it
is  standing
challenge
to
existing
methods
of
historical
instruction
if
the
study
of
history
cannot
be
made
truly
progressive
like
the
study
of
mathematics
science
and
languages
then
the
historians
assume  grave
responsibility
in
adding
their
subject
to
the
already
overloaded
curriculum
if
the
successive
historical
texts
are
only
enlarged
editions
of
the
first
text
more
facts
more
dates
more
words
then
history
deserves
most
of
the
sharp
criticism
which
it
is
receiving
from
teachers
of
science
civics
and
economics
in
this
condition
of
affairs
we
find
our
justification
for
offering  new
high
school
text
in
american
history
our
first
contribution
is
one
of
omission
the
time
honored
stories
of
exploration
and
the
biographies
of
heroes
are
left
out
we
frankly
hold
that
if
pupils
know
little
or
nothing
about
columbus
cortes
magellan
or
captain
john
smith
by
the
time
they
reach
the
high
school
it
is
useless
to
tell
the
same
stories
for
perhaps
the
fourth
time
it
is
worse
than
useless
it
is
an
offense
against
the
teachers
of
those
subjects
that
are
demonstrated
to
be
progressive
in
character
in
the
next
place
we
have
omitted
all
descriptions
of
battles
our
reasons
for
this
are
simple
the
strategy
of  campaign
or
of  single
battle
is  highly
technical
and
usually  highly
controversial
matter
about
which
experts
differ
widely
in
the
field
of
military
and
naval
operations
most
writers
and
teachers
of
history
are
mere
novices
to
dispose
of
gettysburg
or
the
wilderness
in
ten
lines
or
ten
pages
is
equally
absurd
to
the
serious
student
of
military
affairs
any
one
who
compares
the
ordinary
textbook
account
of  single
civil
war
campaign
with
the
account
given
by
ropes
for
instance
will
ask
for
no
further
comment
no
youth
called
upon
to
serve
our
country
in
arms
would
think
of
turning
to  high
school
manual
for
information
about
the
art
of
warfare
the
dramatic
scene
or
episode
so
useful
in
arousing
the
interest
of
the
immature
pupil
seems
out
of
place
in  book
that
deliberately
appeals
to
boys
and
girls
on
the
very
threshold
of
life  serious
responsibilities
it
is
not
upon
negative
features
however
that
we
rest
our
case
it
is
rather
upon
constructive
features
first
we
have
written  topical
not  narrative
history
we
have
tried
to
set
forth
the
important
aspects
problems
and
movements
of
each
period
bringing
in
the
narrative
rather
by
way
of
illustration
second
we
have
emphasized
those
historical
topics
which
help
to
explain
how
our
nation
has
come
to
be
what
it
is
to
day
third
we
have
dwelt
fully
upon
the
social
and
economic
aspects
of
our
history
especially
in
relation
to
the
politics
of
each
period
fourth
we
have
treated
the
causes
and
results
of
wars
the
problems
of
financing
and
sustaining
armed
forces
rather
than
military
strategy
these
are
the
subjects
which
belong
to  history
for
civilians
these
are
matters
which
civilians
can
understand
matters
which
they
must
understand
if
they
are
to
play
well
their
part
in
war
and
peace
fifth
by
omitting
the
period
of
exploration
we
have
been
able
to
enlarge
the
treatment
of
our
own
time
we
have
given
special
attention
to
the
history
of
those
current
questions
which
must
form
the
subject
matter
of
sound
instruction
in
citizenship
sixth
we
have
borne
in
mind
that
america
with
all
her
unique
characteristics
is  part
of  general
civilization
accordingly
we
have
given
diplomacy
foreign
affairs
world
relations
and
the
reciprocal
influences
of
nations
their
appropriate
place
seventh
we
have
deliberately
aimed
at
standards
of
maturity
the
study
of  mere
narrative
calls
mainly
for
the
use
of
the
memory
we
have
aimed
to
stimulate
habits
of
analysis
comparison
association
reflection
and
generalization
habits
calculated
to
enlarge
as
well
as
inform
the
mind
we
have
been
at
great
pains
to
make
our
text
clear
simple
and
direct
but
we
have
earnestly
sought
to
stretch
the
intellects
of
our
readers
to
put
them
upon
their
mettle
most
of
them
will
receive
the
last
of
their
formal
instruction
in
the
high
school
the
world
will
soon
expect
maturity
from
them
their
achievements
will
depend
upon
the
possession
of
other
powers
than
memory
alone
the
effectiveness
of
their
citizenship
in
our
republic
will
be
measured
by
the
excellence
of
their
judgment
as
well
as
the
fullness
of
their

great

the
tide
of
migration
that
set
in
toward
the
shores
of
north
america
during
the
early
years
of
the
seventeenth
century
was
but
one
phase
in
the
restless
and
eternal
movement
of
mankind
upon
the
surface
of
the
earth
the
ancient
greeks
flung
out
their
colonies
in
every
direction
westward
as
far
as
gaul
across
the
mediterranean
and
eastward
into
asia
minor
perhaps
to
the
very
confines
of
india
the
romans
supported
by
their
armies
and
their
government
spread
their
dominion
beyond
the
narrow
lands
of
italy
until
it
stretched
from
the
heather
of
scotland
to
the
sands
of
arabia
the
teutonic
tribes
from
their
home
beyond
the
danube
and
the
rhine
poured
into
the
empire
of
the
caesars
and
made
the
beginnings
of
modern
europe
of
this
great
sweep
of
races
and
empires
the
settlement
of
america
was
merely  part
and
it
was
moreover
only
one
aspect
of
the
expansion
which
finally
carried
the
peoples
the
institutions
and
the
trade
of
europe
to
the
very
ends
of
the
earth
in
one
vital
point
it
must
be
noted
american
colonization
differed
from
that
of
the
ancients
the
greeks
usually
carried
with
them
affection
for
the
government
they
left
behind
and
sacred
fire
from
the
altar
of
the
parent
city
but
thousands
of
the
immigrants
who
came
to
america
disliked
the
state
and
disowned
the
church
of
the
mother
country
they
established
compacts
of
government
for
themselves
and
set
up
altars
of
their
own
they
sought
not
only
new
soil
to
till
but
also
political
and
religious
liberty
for
themselves
and
their
children
the
agencies
of
american
colonization
it
was
no
light
matter
for
the
english
to
cross
three
thousand
miles
of
water
and
found
homes
in
the
american
wilderness
at
the
opening
of
the
seventeenth
century
ships
tools
and
supplies
called
for
huge
outlays
of
money
stores
had
to
be
furnished
in
quantities
sufficient
to
sustain
the
life
of
the
settlers
until
they
could
gather
harvests
of
their
own
artisans
and
laborers
of
skill
and
industry
had
to
be
induced
to
risk
the
hazards
of
the
new
world
soldiers
were
required
for
defense
and
mariners
for
the
exploration
of
inland
waters
leaders
of
good
judgment
adept
in
managing
men
had
to
be
discovered
altogether
such
an
enterprise
demanded
capital
larger
than
the
ordinary
merchant
or
gentleman
could
amass
and
involved
risks
more
imminent
than
he
dared
to
assume
though
in
later
days
after
initial
tests
had
been
made
wealthy
proprietors
were
able
to
establish
colonies
on
their
own
account
it
was
the
corporation
that
furnished
the
capital
and
leadership
in
the
beginning
the
trading
company
english
pioneers
in
exploration
found
an
instrument
for
colonization
in
companies
of
merchant
adventurers
which
had
long
been
employed
in
carrying
on
commerce
with
foreign
countries
such  corporation
was
composed
of
many
persons
of
different
ranks
of
society
noblemen
merchants
and
gentlemen
who
banded
together
for  particular
undertaking
each
contributing  sum
of
money
and
sharing
in

way
of
production
under
this
stern
economic
necessity
puritans
scotch
irish
germans
and
all
were
alike
laid
immigrants
who
paid
their
own
way
many
of
the
immigrants
to
america
in
colonial
days
were
capitalists
themselves
in  small
or  large
way
and
paid
their
own
passage
what
proportion
of
the
colonists
were
able
to
finance
their
voyage
across
the
sea
is  matter
of
pure
conjecture
undoubtedly  very
considerable
number
could
do
so
for
we
can
trace
the
family
fortunes
of
many
early
settlers
henry
cabot
lodge
is
authority
for
the
statement
that
the
settlers
of
new
england
were
drawn
from
the
country
gentlemen
small
farmers
and
yeomanry
of
the
mother
country
many
of
the
emigrants
were
men
of
wealth
as
the
old
lists
show
and
all
of
them
with
few
exceptions
were
men
of
property
and
good
standing
they
did
not
belong
to
the
classes
from
which
emigration
is
usually
supplied
for
they
all
had  stake
in
the
country
they
left
behind
though
it
would
be
interesting
to
know
how
accurate
this
statement
is
or
how
applicable
to
the
other
colonies
no
study
has
as
yet
been
made
to
gratify
that
interest
for
the
present
it
is
an
unsolved
problem
just
how
many
of
the
colonists
were
able
to
bear
the
cost
of
their
own
transfer
to
the
new
world
indentured
servants
that
at
least
tens
of
thousands
of
immigrants
were
unable
to
pay
for
their
passage
is
established
beyond
the
shadow
of  doubt
by
the
shipping
records
that
have
come
down
to
us
the
great
barrier
in
the
way
of
the
poor
who
wanted
to
go
to
america
was
the
cost
of
the
sea
voyage
to
overcome
this
difficulty  plan
was
worked
out
whereby
shipowners
and
other
persons
of
means
furnished
the
passage
money
to
immigrants
in
return
for
their
promise
or
bond
to
work
for  term
of
years
to
repay
the
sum
advanced
this
system
was
called
indentured
servitude
it
is
probable
that
the
number
of
bond
servants
exceeded
the
original
twenty
thousand
puritans
the
yeomen
the
virginia
gentlemen
and
the
huguenots
combined
all
the
way
down
the
coast
from
massachusetts
to
georgia
were
to
be
found
in
the
fields
kitchens
and
workshops
men
women
and
children
serving
out
terms
of
bondage
generally
ranging
from
five
to
seven
years
in
the
proprietary
colonies
the
proportion
of
bond
servants
was
very
high
the
baltimores
penns
carterets
and
other
promoters
anxiously
sought
for
workers
of
every
nationality
to
till
their
fields
for
land
without
labor
was
worth
no
more
than
land
in
the
moon
hence
the
gates
of
the
proprietary
colonies
were
flung
wide
open
every
inducement
was
offered
to
immigrants
in
the
form
of
cheap
land
and
special
efforts
were
made
to
increase
the
population
by
importing
servants
in
pennsylvania
it
was
not
uncommon
to
find  master
with
fifty
bond
servants
on
his
estate
it
has
been
estimated
that
two
thirds
of
all
the
immigrants
into
pennsylvania
between
the
opening
of
the
eighteenth
century
and
the
outbreak
of
the
revolution
were
in
bondage
in
the
other
middle
colonies
the
number
was
doubtless
not
so
large
but
it
formed  considerable
part
of
the
population
the
story
of
this
traffic
in
white
servants
is
one
of
the
most
striking
things
in
the
history
of
labor
bondmen
differed
from
the
serfs
of
the
feudal
age
in
that
they
were
not
bound
to
the
soil
but
to
the
master
they
likewise
differed
from
the
negro
slaves
in
that
their
servitude
had  time
limit
still
they
were
subject
to
many
special
disabilities
it
was
for
instance  common
practice
to
impose
on
them
penalties
far
heavier
than
were
imposed
upon
freemen
for
the
same
offense  free
citizen
of
pennsylvania
who
indulged
in
horse
racing
and
gambling
was
let
off
with  fine  white
servant
guilty
of
the
same
unlawful
conduct
was
whipped
at
the
post
and
fined
as
well
the
ordinary
life
of
the
white
servant
was
also
severely
restricted  bondman
could
not
marry
without
his
master  consent
nor
engage
in
trade
nor
refuse
work
assigned
to
him
for
an
attempt
to
escape
or
indeed
for
any
infraction
of
the
law
the
term
of
service
was
extended
the
condition
of
white
bondmen
in
virginia
according
to
lodge
was
little
better
than
that
of
slaves
loose
indentures
and
harsh
laws
put
them
at
the
mercy
of
their
masters
it
would
not
be
unfair
to
add
that
such
was
their
lot
in
all
other
colonies
their
fate
depended
upon
the
temper
of
their
masters
cruel
as
was
the
system
in
many
ways
it
gave
thousands
of
people
in
the
old
world  chance
to
reach
the
new
an
opportunity
to
wrestle
with
fate
for
freedom
and  home
of
their
own
when
their
weary
years
of
servitude
were
over
if
they
survived
they
might
obtain
land
of
their
own
or
settle
as
free
mechanics
in
the
towns
for
many  bondman
the
gamble
proved
to
be  losing
venture
because
he
found
himself
unable
to
rise
out
of
the
state
of
poverty
and
dependence
into
which
his
servitude
carried
him
for
thousands
on
the
contrary
bondage
proved
to
be  real
avenue
to
freedom
and
prosperity
some
of
the
best
citizens
of
america
have
the
blood
of
indentured
servants
in
their
veins
the
transported
involuntary
servitude
in
their
anxiety
to
secure
settlers
the
companies
and
proprietors
having
colonies
in
america
either
resorted
to
or
connived
at
the
practice
of
kidnapping
men
women
and
children
from
the
streets
of
english
cities
in
it
was
officially
estimated
that
ten
thousand
persons
were
spirited
away
to
america
many
of
the
victims
of
the
practice
were
young
children
for
the
traffic
in
them
was
highly
profitable
orphans
and
dependents
were
sometimes
disposed
of
in
america
by
relatives
unwilling
to
support
them
in  single
year
about
fifteen
hundred
children
were
shipped
to
virginia
in
this
gruesome
business
there
lurked
many
tragedies
and
very
few
romances
parents
were
separated
from
their
children
and
husbands
from
their
wives
hundreds
of
skilled
artisans
carpenters
smiths
and
weavers
utterly
disappeared
as
if
swallowed
up
by
death  few
thus
dragged
off
to
the
new
world
to
be
sold
into
servitude
for  term
of
five
or
seven
years
later
became
prosperous
and
returned
home
with
fortunes
in
one
case  young
man
who
was
forcibly
carried
over
the
sea
lived
to
make
his
way
back
to

and

the
kidnapped
at
least
in
economic
position
were
convicts
deported
to
the
colonies
for
life
in
lieu
of
fines
and
imprisonment
the
americans
protested
vigorously
but
ineffectually
against
this
practice
indeed
they
exaggerated
its
evils
for
many
of
the
criminals
were
only
mild

unduly
harsh
and
cruel
laws  peasant

the

rivaling
in
numbers
in

course
of
time
the
indentured
servants
and
whites
carried
to
america
against
their
will
were
the
african
negroes
brought
to
america
and
sold
into
slavery
when
this
form
of
bondage
was
first
introduced
into
virginia
in
it
was
looked
upon
as  temporary
necessity
to
be
discarded
with
the
increase
of
the
white
population
moreover
it
does
not
appear
that
those
planters
who
first
bought
negroes
at
the
auction
block
intended
to
establish  system
of
permanent
bondage
only
by  slow
process
did
chattel
slavery
take
firm
root
and
become
recognized
as
the
leading
source
of
the
labor
supply
in
thirty
years
after
the
introduction
of
slavery
there
were
only
three
hundred
africans
in
virginia
the
great
increase
in
later
years
was
due
in
no
small
measure
to
the
inordinate
zeal
for
profits
that
seized
slave
traders
both
in
old
and
in
new
england
finding
it
relatively
easy
to
secure
negroes
in
africa
they
crowded
the
southern
ports
with
their
vessels
the
english
royal
african
company
sent
to
america
annually
between
and
from
five
to
ten
thousand
slaves
the
ship
owners
of
new
england
were
not
far
behind
their
english
brethren
in
pushing
this
extraordinary
traffic
as
the
proportion
of
the
negroes
to
the
free
white
population
steadily
rose
and
as
whole
sections
were
overrun
with
slaves
and
slave
traders
the
southern
colonies
grew
alarmed
in
virginia
sought
to
curtail
the
importation
by
placing  duty
of
on
each
slave
this
effort
was
futile
for
the
royal
governor
promptly
vetoed
it
from
time
to
time
similar
bills
were
passed
only
to
meet
with
royal
disapproval
south
carolina
in
absolutely
prohibited
importation
but
the
measure
was
killed
by
the
british
crown
as
late
as
virginia
not
daunted
by  century
of
rebuffs
sent
to
george
iii  petition
in
this
vein
the
importation
of
slaves
into
the
colonies
from
the
coast
of
africa
hath
long
been
considered
as  trade
of
great
inhumanity
and
under
its
present
encouragement
we
have
too
much
reason
to
fear
will
endanger
the
very
existence
of
your
majesty  american
dominions
deeply
impressed
with
these
sentiments
we
most
humbly
beseech
your
majesty
to
remove
all
those
restraints
on
your
majesty  governors
of
this
colony
which
inhibit
their
assenting
to
such
laws
as
might
check
so
very
pernicious  commerce
all
such
protests
were
without
avail
the
negro
population
grew
by
leaps
and
bounds
until
on
the
eve
of
the
revolution
it
amounted
to
more
than
half  million
in
five
states
maryland
virginia
the
two
carolinas
and
georgia
the
slaves
nearly
equalled
or
actually
exceeded
the
whites
in
number
in
south
carolina
they
formed
almost
two
thirds
of
the
population
even
in
the
middle
colonies
of
delaware
and
pennsylvania
about
one
fifth
of
the
inhabitants
were
from
africa
to
the
north
the
proportion
of
slaves
steadily
diminished
although
chattel
servitude
was
on
the
same
legal
footing
as
in
the
south
in
new

approximately
one
in

and
in

one

were

the
climate
the

the

and
the

of

were
all
unfavorable
to
the
growth
of  servile
population
still
slavery
though

was  part
of

northern

the

may
be
acquired
held
divided
among
heirs
and
bought
and
sold
exercises  deep
influence
on
the
life
and
culture
of  people
the
feudal
and
aristocratic
societies
of
europe
were
founded
on  system
of
landlordism
which
was
characterized
by
two
distinct
features
in
the
first
place
the
land
was
nearly
all
held
in
great
estates
each
owned
by  single
proprietor
in
the
second
place
every
estate
was
kept
intact
under
the
law
of
primogeniture
which
at
the
death
of  lord
transferred
all
his
landed
property
to
his
eldest
son
this
prevented
the
subdivision
of
estates
and
the
growth
of  large
body
of
small
farmers
or
freeholders
owning
their
own
land
it
made  form
of
tenantry
or
servitude
inevitable
for
the
mass
of
those
who
labored
on
the
land
it
also
enabled
the
landlords
to
maintain
themselves
in
power
as  governing
class
and
kept
the
tenants
and
laborers
subject
to
their
economic
and
political
control
if
land
tenure
was
so
significant
in
europe
it
was
equally
important
in
the
development
of
america
where
practically
all
the
first
immigrants
were
forced
by
circumstances
to
derive
their
livelihood
from
the
soil
experiments
in
common
tillage
in
the
new
world
with
its
broad
extent
of
land
awaiting
the
white
man  plow
it
was
impossible
to
introduce
in
its
entirety
and
over
the
whole
area
the
system
of
lords
and
tenants
that
existed
across
the
sea
so
it
happened
that
almost
every
kind
of
experiment
in
land
tenure
from
communism
to
feudalism
was
tried
in
the
early
days
of
the
jamestown
colony
the
land
though
owned
by
the
london
company
was
tilled
in
common
by
the
settlers
no
man
had  separate
plot
of
his
own
the
motto
of
the
community
was
labor
and
share
alike
all
were
supposed
to
work
in
the
fields
and
receive
an
equal
share
of
the
produce
at
plymouth
the
pilgrims
attempted  similar
experiment
laying
out
the
fields
in
common
and
distributing
the
joint
produce
of
their
labor
with
rough
equality
among
the
workers
in
both
colonies
the
communistic
experiments
were
failures
angry
at
the
lazy
men
in
jamestown
who
idled
their
time
away
and
yet
expected
regular
meals
captain
john
smith
issued  manifesto
everyone
that
gathereth
not
every
day
as
much
as  do
the
next
day
shall
be
set
beyond
the
river
and
forever
banished
from
the
fort
and
live
there
or
starve
even
this
terrible
threat
did
not
bring  change
in
production
not
until
each
man
was
given  plot
of
his
own
to
till
not
until
each
gathered
the
fruits
of
his
own
labor
did
the
colony
prosper
in
plymouth
where
the
communal
experiment
lasted
for
five
years
the
results
were
similar
to
those
in
virginia
and
the
system
was
given
up
for
one
of
separate
fields
in
which
every
person
could
set
corn
for
his

could
retain

dispose
of
it
all
in
large
or
small
lots
while
he
generally
kept
for
himself
an
estate
of
baronial
proportions
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
manage
directly
any
considerable
part
of
the
land
in
his
dominion
consequently
he
either
sold
it
in
parcels
for
lump
sums
or
granted
it
to
individuals
on
condition
that
they
make
to
him
an
annual
payment
in

known
as
quit

for

it
was
laid

it
proved
to
be  burden  source
of
constant
irritation
and
it
became  formidable
item
in
the
long
list
of
grievances
which
led
to
the
american
revolution
something
still
more
like
the
feudal
system
of
the
old
world
appeared
in
the
numerous
manors
or
the
huge
landed
estates
granted
by
the
crown
the
companies
or
the
proprietors
in
the
colony

were
sixty
manors
of
three
thousand
acres
each
owned
by
wealthy
men
and
tilled
by
tenants
holding
small
plots
under
certain
restrictions
of
tenure
in
new
york
also
there
were
many
manors
of
wide
extent
most
of
which
originated
in
the
days
of
the
dutch
west
india
company
when
extensive
concessions
were
made
to
patroons
to
induce
them
to
bring
over
settlers
the
van
rensselaer
the
van
cortlandt
and
the
livingston
manors
were
so
large
and
populous
that
each
was
entitled
to
send  representative
to
the
provincial
legislature
the
tenants
on
the
new
york
manors
were
in
somewhat
the
same
position
as
serfs
on
old
european
estates
they
were
bound
to
pay
the
owner  rent
in
money
and
kind
they
ground
their
grain
at
his
mill
and
they
were
subject
to
his
judicial
power
because
he
held
court
and
meted
out
justice
in
some
instances
extending
to
capital
punishment
the
manors
of
new

or

were
however
of
slight
consequence
as
compared
with
the
vast
plantations
of
the
southern
seaboard
huge
estates
far
wider
in
expanse
than
many  european
barony
and
tilled
by
slaves
more
servile
than
any
feudal
tenants
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
this
system
of
land
tenure
became
the
dominant
feature
of  large
section
and
gave  decided
bent
to
the
economic
and
political
life

was
against
all

in
the
direction
of
the
freehold
that
is
the

owned
outright

this
was
favored
by
natural
circumstances
and
the
spirit
of
the
immigrants
for
one
thing
the
abundance
of
land
and
the
scarcity
of
labor
made
it
impossible
for
the
companies
the
proprietors
or
the

to
develop
over
the
whole

of
vast
estates
in
many
sections
particularly
in

the

the

soil
the

conspired
to
keep

the
english

they
had

permanent
dependency
of
any
kind
in
the
new
if
they
could
not
get
freeholds
they
would
not
settle
at
all
thus
they
forced
proprietors
and
companies
to
bid
for
their
enterprise
by
selling
land
in
small
lots
so
it
happened
that
the
freehold
of
modest
proportions
became
the
cherished
unit
of
american
farmers
the
people
who
tilled
the
farms
were

thus
developed

agriculture
they
had  common
tie
in
that
they
both
cultivated
the
soil
and
possessed
the
local
interest
and
independence
which
arise
from
that
occupation
their
methods
and
their
culture
however
differed
widely
the
southern
planter
on
his
broad
acres
tilled
by
slaves
resembled
the
english
landlord
on
his
estates
more
than
he
did
the
colonial
farmer
who
labored
with
his
own
hands
in
the
fields
and
forests
he
sold
his
rice
and
tobacco
in
large
amounts
directly
to
english
factors
who
took
his
entire
crop
in
exchange
for
goods
and
cash
his
fine
clothes

and

he
bought
in
english
markets
loving
the

old
culture
of
the
mother
country
he
often
sent
his
sons
to
oxford
or
cambridge
for
their
education
in
short
he
depended
very
largely
for
his
prosperity
and
his
enjoyment
of
life
upon
close
relations
with
the
old
world
he
did
not
even
need
market
towns
in
which
to
buy
native
goods
for
they
were
made
on
his
own
plantation
by
his
own
artisans
who
were
usually
gifted
slaves
the
economic
condition
of
the
small
farmer
was
totally
different
his
crops
were
not
big
enough
to
warrant
direct
connection
with
english
factors
or
the
personal
maintenance
of  corps
of
artisans
he
needed
local
markets
and
they
sprang
up
to
meet
the
need
smiths
hatters
weavers
wagon
makers
and
potters
at
neighboring
towns
supplied
him
with
the
rough
products
of
their
native
skill
the
finer
goods
bought
by
the
rich
planter
in
england
the
small
farmer
ordinarily
could
not
buy
his
wants
were
restricted
to
staples
like
tea
and
sugar
and
between
him
and
the
european
market
stood
the
merchant
his
community
was
therefore
more
self
sufficient
than
the

of

it
was

provincial
more

of

be
overestimated
for
many  century
the
english
had
employed
their
fine
woolen
cloth
as
the
chief
staple
in  lucrative
foreign
trade
and
the
government
had
come
to
look
upon
it
as
an
object
of
special
interest
and
protection
when
the
colonies
were
established
both
merchants
and
statesmen
naturally
expected
to
maintain  monopoly
of
increasing
value
but
before

the
americans
instead
of
buying
cloth
especially
of

coarser
varieties
were
making
it

sell
in

place

here
were
rivals
in
the
place
of

reliance
upon

markets
here
was
the
germ
of
economic
independence
if
british
merchants
had
not
discovered
it
in
the
ordinary
course
of
trade
observant
officers
in

provinces
would
have
conveyed
the
news
to
them
even

early
years
of
the
eighteenth
century
the
royal
governor
of

wrote
of
the
industrious
americans
to

consequence
will
be
that
if
they
can
clothe
themselves

not
only
comfortably
but
handsomely
too
without
the
help
of
england
they
who
already

will
soon
think
of
putting

designs
they

will
not
seem
strange

are
looking
for
them
beneath
the
arctic
circle
we
hear
that
they
have
pierced
into
the

of

they

at

engaged
under

nor
is
the

more
discouraging

we

strike

no
sea
but
what
is
vexed
by
their

no
climate
that
is
not
witness
to
their

neither
the
perseverance
of
holland
nor
the
activity
of
france
nor
the
dexterous
and
firm
sagacity
of
english
enterprise
ever
carried
this
most
perilous
mode
of
hard
industry
to
the
extent
to
which
it
has
been
pushed
by
this
recent
people
the
influence
of
the
business
was
widespread  large
and
lucrative
european
trade
was
built
upon
it
the
better
quality
of
the
fish
caught
for
food
was
sold
in
the
markets
of
spain
portugal
and
italy
or
exchanged
for
salt
lemons
and
raisins
for
the
american
market
the
lower
grades
of
fish
were
carried
to
the
west
indies
for
slave
consumption
and
in
part
traded
for
sugar
and
molasses
which
furnished
the
raw
materials
for
the
thriving
rum
industry
of
new
england
these
activities
in
turn
stimulated
shipbuilding
steadily
enlarging
the
demand
for
fishing
and
merchant
craft
of
every
kind
and
thus
keeping
the
shipwrights

rope
makers
and

also
increased

of
the

collected
in
the

markets
of
europe
and
the
west

the

paid
for

manufactures
so
an
ever

seems

that
however

not
the

of
its

it
must
be
considered
in
relation
to
the
growth
of

colonial
trade
in

which
can

by  few

figures
the

was
in
on
the
eve
of
the
american
revolution
namely
in

exports
to

amounted
to
in

words
almost
as
much
as
the

the

intercolonial

the
bad

of

made

crowded
as
it
was
with
hard
and
unremitting
toil
left
scant
leisure
for
the
cultivation
of
the

and

there
was
little
money
in
private

or
public
treasuries
to
be
dedicated
to
schools
libraries
and
museums
few
there
were
with
time
to
read
long
and
widely
and
fewer
still
who
could
devote
their
lives
to
things
that
delight
the
eye
and
the
mind
and
yet
poor
and
meager
as
the
intellectual
life
of
the
colonists
may
seem
by
way
of
comparison
heroic
efforts
were
made
in
every
community
to
lift
the
people
above
the
plane
of
mere
existence
after
the
first
clearings
were
opened
in
the
forests
those
efforts
were
redoubled
and
with
lengthening
years
told
upon
the
thought
and
spirit
of
the
land
the
appearance
during
the
struggle
with
england
of
an
extraordinary
group
of
leaders
familiar
with
history
political
philosophy
and
the
arts
of
war
government
and
diplomacy
itself
bore
eloquent
testimony
to
the
high
quality
of
the
american
intellect
no
one
not
even
the
most
critical
can
run
through
the
writings
of

scattered
from

the
adamses
ellsworth
the
morrises
the
livingstons
hamilton
franklin
washington
madison
marshall
henry
the
randolphs
and
the
pinckneys
without
coming
to
the
conclusion
that
there
was
something
in
american
colonial
life
which
fostered
minds
of
depth
and
power
women
surmounted
even
greater
difficulties
than
the
men
in
the
process
of
self
education
and
their
keen
interest
in
public
issues
is
evident
in
many  record
like
the
letters
of
mrs
john
adams
to
her
husband
during
the
revolution
the
writings
of
mrs
mercy
otis
warren
the
sister
of
james
otis
who
measured
her
pen
with
the
british
propagandists
and
the
patriot
newspapers
founded
and
managed
by
women
the
leadership
of
the
churches
in
the
intellectual
life
of
america
the
churches
assumed  role
of
high
importance
there
were
abundant
reasons
for
this
in
many
of
the
colonies
maryland
pennsylvania
and
new
england
the
religious
impulse
had
been
one
of
the
impelling
motives
in
stimulating
immigration
in
all
the
colonies
the
clergy
at
least
in
the
beginning
formed
the
only
class
with
any
leisure
to
devote
to
matters
of
the
spirit
they
preached
on
sundays
and
taught
school
on
week
days
they
led
in
the
discussion
of
local
problems
and
in
the
formation
of
political
opinion
so
much
of
which
was
concerned
with
the
relation
between
church
and
state
they
wrote
books
and
pamphlets
they
filled
most
of
the
chairs
in
the
colleges
under
clerical
guidance
intellectual
and
spiritual
the
americans
received
their
formal
education
in
several
of
the
provinces
the
anglican
church
was
established
by
law
in
new
england
the
puritans
were
supreme
notwithstanding
the
efforts
of
the
crown
to
overbear
their
authority
in
the
middle
colonies
particularly
the
multiplication
of
sects
made
the
dominance
of
any
single
denomination
impossible
and
in
all
of
them
there
was  growing
diversity
of
faith
which
promised
in
time  separation
of
church
and
state
and
freedom
of
opinion
the
church
of
england
virginia
was
the
stronghold
of
the
english
system
of
church
and
state
the
anglican
faith
and
worship
were
prescribed
by
law
sustained
by
taxes
imposed
on
all
and
favored
by
the
governor
the
provincial
councilors
and
the
richest
planters
the
established
church
says
lodge
was
one
of
the
appendages
of
the
virginia
aristocracy
they
controlled
the
vestries
and
the
ministers
and
the
parish
church
stood
not
infrequently
on
the
estate
of
the
planter
who
built
and
managed
it
as
in
england
catholics
and
protestant
dissenters
were
at
first
laid
under
heavy
disabilities
only
slowly
and
on
sufferance
were
they
admitted
to
the
province
but
when
once
they
were
even
covertly
tolerated
they
pressed
steadily
in
until
by
the
revolution
they
outnumbered
the
adherents
of
the
established
order
the
church
was
also
sanctioned
by
law
and
supported
by
taxes
in
the
carolinas
after
and
in
georgia
after
that
colony
passed
directly
under
the
crown
in
this
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
majority
of
the
inhabitants
were
dissenters
against
the
protests
of
the
catholics
it
was
likewise
established
in
maryland
in
new
york
too
notwithstanding
the
resistance
of
the
dutch
the
established
church
was
fostered
by
the
provincial
officials
and
the
anglicans
embracing
about
one
fifteenth
of
the
population
exerted
an
influence
all
out
of
proportion
to
their
numbers
many
factors
helped
to
enhance
the
power
of
the
english
church
in
the
colonies
it
was
supported
by
the
british
government
and
the
official
class
sent
out
to
the
provinces
its
bishops
and
archbishops
in
england
were
appointed
by
the
king
and
its
faith
and
service
were
set
forth
by
acts
of
parliament
having
its
seat
of
power
in
the
english
monarchy
it
could
hold
its
clergy
and
missionaries
loyal
to
the
crown
and
so
counteract
to
some
extent
the
independent
spirit
that
was
growing
up
in
america
the
church
always  strong
bulwark
of
the
state
therefore
had  political
role
to
play
here
as
in
england
able
bishops
and
far
seeing
leaders
firmly
grasped
this
fact
about
the
middle
of
the
eighteenth
century
and
redoubled
their
efforts
to
augment
the
influence
of
the
church
in
provincial
affairs
unhappily
for
their
plans
they
failed
to
calculate
in
advance
the
effect
of
their
methods
upon
dissenting
protestants
who
still
cherished
memories
of
bitter
religious
conflicts
in
the
mother
country
puritanism
in
new
england
if
the
established
faith
made
for
imperial
unity
the
same
could
not
be
said
of
puritanism
the
plymouth
pilgrims
had
cast
off
all
allegiance
to
the
anglican
church
and
established  separate
and
independent
congregation
before
they
came
to
america
the
puritans
essaying
at
first
the
task
of
reformers
within
the
church
soon
after
their
arrival
in
massachusetts
likewise
flung
off
their
yoke
of
union
with
the
anglicans
in
each
town  separate
congregation
was
organized
the
male
members
choosing
the

also
composed

were
determined
the
union
of
church
and
government
was
thus
complete
and
uniformity
of
faith
and
life
prescribed
by
law
and
enforced
by
civil
authorities
but
this
worked
for
local
autonomy
instead
of
imperial
unity
the
clergy
became  powerful
class
dominant
through
their
learning
and
their
fearful
denunciations
of
the
faithless
they
wrote
the
books
for
the
people
to
read
the
famous
cotton
mather
having
three
hundred
and
eighty
three
books
and
pamphlets
to
his
credit
in
cooperation
with
the
civil
officers
they
enforced  strict
observance
of
the
puritan
sabbath  day
of
rest
that
began
at
six  clock
on
saturday
evening
and
lasted
until
sunset
on
sunday
all
work
all
trading
all
amusement
and
all
worldly
conversation
were
absolutely
prohibited
during
those
hours  thoughtless
maid
servant
who
for
some
earthly
reason
smiled
in
church
was
in
danger
of
being
banished
as  vagabond
robert
pike  devout
puritan
thinking
the
sun
had
gone
to
rest
ventured
forth
on
horseback
one
sunday
evening
and
was
luckless
enough
to
have  ray
of
light
strike
him
through  rift
in
the
clouds
the
next
day
he
was
brought
into
court
and
fined
for
his
ungodly
conduct
with
persons
accused
of
witchcraft
the
puritans
were
still
more
ruthless
when  mania
of
persecution
swept
over
massachusetts
in
eighteen
people
were
hanged
one
was
pressed
to
death
many
suffered
imprisonment
and
two
died
in
jail
just
about
this
time
however
there
came  break
in
the
uniformity
of
puritan
rule
the
crown
and
church
in
england
had
long
looked
upon
it
with
disfavor
and
in
king
charles
ii
annulled
the
old
charter
of
the
massachusetts
bay
company  new
document
issued
seven
years
later
wrested
from
the
puritans
of
the
colony
the
right
to
elect
their
own
governor
and
reserved
the
power
of
appointment
to
the
king
it
also
abolished
the
rule
limiting
the
suffrage
to
church
members
substituting
for
it  simple
property
qualification
thus  royal
governor
and
an
official
family
certain
to
be
episcopalian
in
faith
and
monarchist
in
sympathies
were
forced
upon
massachusetts
and
members
of
all
religious
denominations
if
they
had
the
required
amount
of
property
were
permitted
to
take
part
in
elections
by
this
act
in
the
name
of
the
crown
the
puritan
monopoly
was
broken
down
in
massachusetts
and
that
province
was
brought
into
line
with
connecticut
rhode
island
and
new
hampshire
where
property
not
religious
faith
was
the
test
for
the
suffrage
growth
of
religious
toleration
though
neither
the
anglicans
of
virginia
nor
the
puritans
of
massachusetts
believed
in
toleration
for
other
denominations
that
principle
was
strictly
applied
in
rhode
island
there
under
the
leadership
of
roger
williams
liberty
in
matters
of
conscience
was
established
in
the
beginning
maryland
by
granting
in
freedom
to
those
who
professed
to
believe
in
jesus
christ
opened
its
gates
to
all
christians
and
pennsylvania
true
to
the
tenets
of
the
friends
gave
freedom
of
conscience
to
those
who
confess
and
acknowledge
the
one
almighty
and
eternal
god
to
be
the
creator
upholder
and
ruler
of
the
world
by
one
circumstance
or
another
the
middle
colonies
were
thus
early
characterized
by
diversity
rather
than
uniformity
of
opinion
dutch
protestants
huguenots
quakers
baptists
presbyterians
new
lights
moravians
lutherans
catholics
and
other
denominations
became
too
strongly
intrenched
and
too
widely
scattered
to
permit
any
one
of
them
to
rule
if
it
had
desired
to
do
so
there
were
communities
and
indeed
whole
sections
where
one
or
another
church
prevailed
but
in
no
colony
was  legislature
steadily
controlled
by  single
group
toleration
encouraged
diversity
and
diversity
in
turn
worked
for
greater
toleration
the
government
and
faith
of
the
dissenting
denominations
conspired
with
economic
and
political
tendencies
to
draw
america
away
from
the
english
state
presbyterians
quakers
baptists
and
puritans
had
no
hierarchy
of
bishops
and
archbishops
to
bind
them
to
the
seat
of
power
in
london
neither
did
they
look
to
that
metropolis
for
guidance
in
interpreting
articles
of
faith
local
self
government
in
matters
ecclesiastical
helped
to
train
them
for
local
self
government
in
matters
political
the
spirit
of
independence
which
led
dissenters
to
revolt
in
the
old
world
nourished
as
it
was
amid
favorable
circumstances
in
the
new
world
made
them
all
the
more
zealous
in
the
defense
of
every
right
against
authority
imposed
from
without
schools
and
colleges
religion
and
local
schools
one
of
the
first
cares
of
each
protestant
denomination
was
the
education
of
the
children
in
the
faith
in
this
work
the
bible
became
the
center
of
interest
the
english
version
was
indeed
the
one
book
of
the
people
farmers
shopkeepers
and
artisans
whose
life
had
once
been
bounded
by
the
daily
routine
of
labor
found
in
the
scriptures
not
only
an
inspiration
to
religious
conduct
but
also  book
of
romance
travel
and
history

the
parables
of
evangelists
stories
of
mission
journeys
of
perils
by
sea
and
among
the
heathen
philosophic
arguments
apocalyptic
visions
all
were
flung
broadcast
over
minds
unoccupied
for
the
most
part
by
any
rival
learning
as  mere
literary
monument
the
english
version
of
the
bible
remains
the
noblest
example
of
the
english
tongue
it
was
the
king
james
version
just
from
the
press
that
the
pilgrims
brought
across
the
sea
with
them
for
the
authority
of
the
established
church
was
substituted
the
authority
of
the
scriptures
the
puritans
devised  catechism
based
upon
their
interpretation
of
the
bible
and
very
soon
after
their
arrival
in
america
they
ordered
all
parents
and
masters
of
servants
to
be
diligent
in
seeing
that
their
children
and
wards
were
taught
to
read
religious
works
and
give
answers
to
the
religious
questions
massachusetts
was
scarcely
twenty
years
old
before
education
of
this
character
was
declared
to
be
compulsory
and
provision
was
made
for
public
schools
where
those
not
taught
at
home
could
receive
instruction
in
reading
and
writing

the
idea
of
compulsory
education
was
not
regarded
with
the
same
favor
but
the
whole
land
was
nevertheless
dotted
with
little
schools
kept
by
dames
itinerant
teachers
or
local
parsons
whether
we
turn
to
the
life
of
franklin
in

we

tiny
schoolhouses
where

and
sometimes

were

there
were

fathers
and
mothers
of
the
better
kind
gave
their
children
the
rudiments
of

though
illiteracy
was
widespread
there
is
evidence
to
show
that
the
diffusion
of
knowledge
among
the
masses
was
making
steady
progress
all
through
the
eighteenth
century
religion
and
higher

religious
motives
entered
into
the
establishment
of
colleges
as
well
as
local
schools
harvard

intended
primarily
to

their

at

and
the

of

organized
by
benjamin
franklin
reflected
the
spirit
of
toleration
by
giving
representation
on
the
board
of
trustees
to
several
religious
sects
it
was
franklin  idea
that
his
college
should
prepare
young
men
to
serve
in
public
office
as
leaders
of
the
people
and
ornaments
to
their
country
self
education
in
america
important
as
were
these
institutions
of
learning
higher
education
was
by
no
means
confined
within
their
walls
many
well
to
do
families
sent
their
sons
to
oxford
or
cambridge
in
england
private
tutoring
in
the
home
was
common
in
still
more
families
there
were
intelligent
children
who
grew
up
in
the
great
colonial
school
of
adversity
and
who
trained
themselves
until
in
every
contest
of
mind
and
wit
they
could
vie
with
the
sons
of
harvard
or
william
and
mary
or
any
other
college
such
for
example
was
benjamin
franklin
whose
charming
autobiography
in
addition
to
being
an
american
classic
is  fine
record
of
self
education
his
formal
training
in
the
classroom
was
limited
to  few
years
at  local
school
in
boston
but
his
self
education
continued
throughout
his
life
he
early
manifested  zeal
for
reading
and
devoured
he
tells
us
his
father  dry
library
on
theology
bunyan  works
defoe  writings
plutarch  lives
locke  on
the
human
understanding
and
innumerable
volumes
dealing
with
secular
subjects
his
literary
style
perhaps
the
best
of
his
time
franklin
acquired
by
the
diligent
and
repeated
analysis
of
the
spectator
in  life
crowded
with
labors
he
found
time
to
read
widely
in
natural
science
and
to
win
single
handed
recognition
at
the
hands
of
european
savants
for
his
discoveries
in
electricity
by
his
own
efforts
he
attained
an
acquaintance
with
latin
italian
french
and
spanish
thus
unconsciously
preparing
himself
for
the
day
when
he
was
to
speak
for
all
america
at
the
court
of
the
king
of
france
lesser
lights
than
franklin
educated
by
the
same
process
were
found
all
over
colonial
america
from
this
fruitful
source
of
native
ability
self
educated
the
american
cause
drew
great
strength
in
the
trials
of
the
revolution
the
colonial
press
the
rise
of
the
newspaper
the
evolution
of
american
democracy
into  government
by
public
opinion
enlightened
by
the
open
discussion
of
political
questions
was
in
no
small
measure
aided
by  free
press
that
too
like
education
was  matter
of
slow
growth  printing
press
was
brought
to
massachusetts
in
but
it
was
put
in
charge
of
an
official
censor
and
limited
to
the
publication
of
religious
works
forty
years
elapsed
before
the
first
newspaper
appeared
bearing
the
curious
title
public
occurrences
both
foreign
and
domestic
and
it
had
not
been
running
very
long
before
the
government
of
massachusetts
suppressed
it
for
discussing  political
question
publishing
indeed
seemed
to
be  precarious
business
but
in
there
came  second
venture
in
journalism
the
boston
news
letter
which
proved
to
be  more
lasting
enterprise
because
it
refrained
from
criticizing
the
authorities
still
the
public
interest
languished
when
franklin  brother
james
began
to
issue
his
new
england
courant
about
his
friends
sought
to
dissuade
him
saying
that
one
newspaper
was
enough
for
america
nevertheless
he
continued
it
and
his
confidence
in
the
future
was
rewarded
in
nearly
every
colony  gazette
or
chronicle
appeared
within
the
next
thirty
years
or
more
benjamin
franklin
was
able
to
record
in
that
america
had
twenty
five
newspapers
boston
led
with
five
philadelphia
had
three
two
in
english
and
one
in
german
censorship
and
restraints
on
the
press
the
idea
of
printing
unlicensed
by
the
government
and
uncontrolled
by
the
church
was
however
slow
in
taking
form
the
founders
of
the
american
colonies
had
never
known
what
it
was
to
have
the
free
and
open
publication
of
books
pamphlets
broadsides
and
newspapers
when
the
art
of
printing
was
first
discovered
the
control
of
publishing
was
vested
in
clerical
authorities
after
the
establishment
of
the
state
church
in
england
in
the
reign
of
elizabeth
censorship
of
the
press
became  part
of
royal
prerogative
printing
was
restricted
to
oxford
cambridge
and
london
and
no
one
could
publish
anything
without
previous
approval
of
the
official
censor
when
the
puritans
were
in
power
the
popular
party
with  zeal
which
rivaled
that
of
the
crown
sought
in
turn
to
silence
royalist
and
clerical
writers
by  vigorous
censorship
after
the
restoration
of
the
monarchy
control
of
the
press
was
once
more
placed
in
royal
hands
where
it
remained
until
when
parliament
by
failing
to
renew
the
licensing
act
did
away
entirely
with
the
official
censorship
by
that
time
political
parties
were
so
powerful
and
so
active
and
printing
presses
were
so
numerous
that
official
review
of
all
published
matter
became  sheer
impossibility
in
america
likewise
some
troublesome
questions
arose
in
connection
with
freedom
of
the
press
the
puritans
of
massachusetts
were
no
less
anxious
than
king
charles
or
the
archbishop
of
london
to
shut
out
from
the
prying
eyes
of
the
people
all
literature
not
mete
for
them
to
read
and
so
they
established  system
of
official
licensing
for
presses
which
lasted
until
in
the
other
colonies
where
there
was
more
diversity
of
opinion
and
publishers
could
set
up
in
business
with
impunity
they
were
nevertheless
constantly
liable
to
arrest
for
printing
anything
displeasing
to
the
colonial
governments
in
the
editor
of
the
mercury
in
philadelphia
was
called
before
the
proprietary
council
and
ordered
to
apologize
for  political
article
and
for  later
offense
of  similar
character
he
was
thrown
into
jail  still
more
famous
case
was
that
of
peter
zenger  new
york
publisher
who
was
arrested
in
for
criticising
the
administration
lawyers
who
ventured
to
defend
the
unlucky
editor
were
deprived
of
their
licenses
to
practice
and
it
became
necessary
to
bring
an
attorney
all
the
way
from
philadelphia
by
this
time
the
tension
of
feeling
was
high
and
the
approbation
of
the
public
was
forthcoming
when
the
lawyer
for
the
defense
exclaimed
to
the
jury
that
the
very
cause
of
liberty
itself
not
that
of
the
poor
printer
was
on
trial
the
verdict
for
zenger
when
it
finally
came
was
the
signal
for
an
outburst
of
popular
rejoicing
already
the
people
of
king
george  province
knew
how
precious  thing
is
the
freedom
of
the
press
thanks
to
the
schools
few
and
scattered
as
they
were
and
to
the
vigilance
of
parents  very
large
portion
perhaps
nearly
one
half
of
the
colonists
could
read
through
the
newspapers
pamphlets
and
almanacs
that
streamed
from
the
types
the
people
could
follow
the
course
of
public
events
and
grasp
the
significance
of
political
arguments
an
american
opinion
was
in
the
process
of
making
an
independent
opinion
nourished
by
the
press
and
enriched
by
discussions
around
the
fireside
and
at
the
taverns
when
the
day
of
resistance
to
british
rule
came
government
by
opinion
was
at
hand
for
every
person
who
could
hear
the
voice
of
patrick
henry
and
samuel
adams
there
were  thousand
who
could
see
their

page

had
spelled

over

call

the
evolution
in
political
institutions
two
very
distinct
lines
of
development
appeared
in
colonial
politics
the
one
exalting
royal
rights
and
aristocratic
privileges
was
the
drift
toward
provincial
government
through
royal
officers
appointed
in
england
the
other
leading
toward
democracy
and
self
government
was
the
growth
in
the
power
of
the
popular
legislative
assembly
each
movement
gave
impetus
to
the
other
with
increasing
force
during
the
passing
years
until
at
last
the
final
collision
between
the
two
ideals
of
government
came
in
the
war
of
independence
the
royal
provinces
of
the
thirteen
english
colonies
eight
were
royal
provinces
in
with
governors
appointed

the

annulled
the

lost
its
charter

and
the

years
later

the

of
the

their
chief

and

he
naturally
sought

enforced

illustration
the

at
new
berne
the
colonial
governors
were
generally
surrounded
by  body
of
office
seekers
and
hunters
for
land
grants
some
of
them
were
noblemen
of
broken
estates
who
had
come
to
america
to
improve
their
fortunes
the
pretensions
of
this
circle
grated
on
colonial
nerves
and
privileges
granted
to
them
often
at
the
expense
of
colonists
did
much
to
deepen
popular
antipathy
to
the
british
government
favors
extended
to
adherents
of
the
established
church
displeased
dissenters
the
reappearance
of
this
formidable
union
of
church
and
state
from
which
they
had
fled
stirred
anew
the
ancient
wrath
against
that
combination
the
colonial
assembly
coincident
with
the
drift
toward
administration
through
royal
governors
was
the
second
and
opposite
tendency
namely  steady
growth
in
the
practice
of
self
government
the
voters
of
england
had
long
been
accustomed
to
share
in
taxation
and
law
making
through
representatives
in
parliament
and
the
idea
was
early
introduced
in
america
virginia
was
only
twelve
years
old
when
its
first
representative
assembly
appeared
as
the
towns
of
massachusetts
multiplied
and
it
became
impossible
for
all
the
members
of
the
corporation
to
meet
at
one
place
the
representative
idea
was
adopted
in
the
river
towns
of
connecticut
formed  representative
system
under
their
fundamental
orders
of
and
the
entire
colony
was
given  royal
charter
in
generosity
as
well
as
practical
considerations
induced
such
proprietors
as
lord
baltimore
and
william
penn
to
invite
their
colonists
to
share
in
the
government
as
soon
as
any
considerable
settlements
were
made
thus
by
one
process
or
another
every
one
of
the
colonies
secured  popular
assembly
it
is
true
that
in
the
provision
for
popular
elections
the
suffrage
was
finally
restricted
to
property
owners
or
taxpayers
with  leaning
toward
the
freehold
qualification
in
virginia
the
rural
voter
had
to
be  freeholder
owning
at
least
fifty
acres
of
land
if
there
was
no
house
on
it
or
twenty
five
acres
with  house
twenty
five
feet
square
in
massachusetts
the
voter
for
member
of
the
assembly
under
the
charter
of
had
to
be  freeholder
of
an
estate
worth
forty
shillings  year
at
least
or
of
other
property
to
the
value
of
forty
pounds
sterling
in
pennsylvania
the
suffrage
was
granted
to
freeholders
owning
fifty
acres
or
more
of
land
well
seated
twelve
acres
cleared
and
to
other
persons
worth
at
least
fifty
pounds
in
lawful
money
restrictions
like
these
undoubtedly
excluded
from
the
suffrage  very
considerable
number
of
men
particularly
the
mechanics
and
artisans
of
the
towns
who
were
by
no
means
content
with
their
position
nevertheless
it
was
relatively
easy
for
any
man
to
acquire  small
freehold
so
cheap
and
abundant
was
land
and
in
fact  large
proportion
of
the
colonists
were
land
owners
thus
the
assemblies
in
spite
of
the
limited
suffrage
acquired  democratic
tone
the
popular
character
of
the
assemblies
increased
as
they
became
engaged
in
battles
with
the
royal
and
proprietary
governors
when
called
upon
by
the
executive
to
make
provision
for
the
support
of
the
administration
the
legislature
took
advantage
of
the
opportunity
to
make
terms
in
the
interest
of
the
taxpayers
it
made
annual
not
permanent
grants
of
money
to
pay
official
salaries
and
then
insisted
upon
electing  treasurer
to
dole
it
out
thus
the
colonists
learned
some
of
the
mysteries
of
public
finance
as
well
as
the
management
of
rapacious
officials
the
legislature
also
used
its
power
over
money
grants
to
force
the
governor
to
sign
bills
which
he
would
otherwise
have
vetoed
contests
between
legislatures
and
governors
as
may
be
imagined
many
and
bitter
were
the
contests
between
the
royal
and
proprietary
governors
and
the
colonial
assemblies
franklin
relates
an
amusing
story
of
how
the
pennsylvania
assembly
held
in
one
hand  bill
for
the
executive
to
sign
and
in
the
other
hand
the
money
to
pay
his
salary
then
with
sly
humor
franklin
adds
do
not
my
courteous
reader
take
pet
at
our
proprietary
constitution
for
these
our
bargain
and
sale
proceedings
in
legislation
it
is  happy
country
where
justice
and
what
was
your
own
before
can
be
had
for
ready
money
it
is
another
addition
to
the
value
of
money
and
of
course
another
spur
to
industry
every
land
is
not
so
blessed
it
must
not
be
thought
however
that
every
governor
got
off
as
easily
as
franklin  tale
implies
on
the
contrary
the
legislatures
like
caesar
fed
upon
meat
that
made
them
great
and
steadily
encroached
upon
executive
prerogatives
as
they
tried
out
and
found
their
strength
if
we
may
believe
contemporary
laments
the
power
of
the
crown
in
america
was
diminishing
when
it
was
struck
down
altogether
in
new
york
the
friends
of
the
governor
complained
in
that
the
inhabitants
of
plantations
are
generally
educated
in
republican
principles
upon

all
is

little
more

unhinged  governor
if
he
would
be

the
people

got
their
whole
administration
in

the
election
of
the

of

assembly
is
by
ballot
not
civil
posts
only
but
all
ecclesiastical
preferments
are
in
the
disposal
or
election
of
the
people
though
baffled
by
the
levelling
principles
of
the
colonial
assemblies
the
governors
did
not
give
up
the
case
as
hopeless
instead
they
evolved  system
of
policy
and
action
which
they
thought
could
bring
the
obstinate
provincials
to
terms
that
system
traceable
in
their
letters
to
the
government
in
london
consisted
of
three
parts
the
royal
officers
in
the
colonies
were
to
be
made
independent
of
the
legislatures
by
taxes
imposed
by
acts
of
parliament  british
standing
army
was
to
be
maintained
in
america
the
remaining
colonial
charters
were
to
be
revoked
and
government
by
direct
royal
authority
was
to
be
enlarged
such  system
seemed
plausible
enough
to
king
george
iii
and
to
many
ministers
of
the
crown
in
london
with
governors
courts
and
an
army
independent
of
the
colonists
they
imagined
it
would
be
easy
to
carry
out
both
royal
orders
and
acts
of
parliament
this
reasoning
seemed
both
practical
and
logical
nor
was
it
founded
on
theory
for
it
came
fresh
from
the
governors
themselves
it
was
wanting
in
one
respect
only
it
failed
to
take
account
of
the
fact
that
the
american
people
were
growing
strong
in
the
practice
of
self
government
and
could
dispense
with
the

of

of

stretched
all

the
answer
it
is
admitted
was
far
from
satisfactory
to

and
the
conduct
of

was
far

thousands

the

struggle
was
especially
expensive
the
twenty
five

sustained
only
by
huge
outlays
of

came
both
england

america
were
staggering
under

and
to
make
matters
worse
there
was  fall

it
was
in

the

of
the

administered
to

as
time
proved
were
difficult
to
estimate
some
british
statesmen
regarded
it
as  happy
circumstance
that
the

already
restive
under
their
administration
had
no
foreign
power
at
hand

aid
them

they
struck
for
independence

was
not

it
was
neither
the

was
the
product
of
the
long
strife
with

which
culminated

the
last
of
the
stuarts
the
struggles
between
charles  and
the
parliamentary
party
and
the
turmoil
of
the
puritan
regime
so
engrossed
the
attention
of
englishmen
at
home
that
they
had
little
time
to
think
of
colonial
policies
or
to
interfere
with
colonial
affairs
the
restoration
of
the
monarchy
in
accompanied
by
internal
peace
and
the
increasing
power
of
the
mercantile
classes
in
the
house

changed
all
that
in
the
reign
of
charles
ii
himself
an
easy
going
person
the
policy
of
regulating
trade
by
act
of
parliament
was
developed
into  closely
knit
system
and
powerful
agencies
to
supervise
the
colonies
were
created
at
the
same
time  system
of
stricter
control
over
the
dominions
was
ushered
in
by
the
annulment
of
the
old
charter
of
massachusetts
which
conferred
so
much
self
government
on
the
puritans
charles
successor
james
ii  man
of
sterner
stuff
and
jealous
of
his
authority
in
the
colonies
as
well
as
at
home
continued
the
policy
thus
inaugurated
and
enlarged
upon
it
if
he
could
have
kept
his
throne
he
would
have
bent
the
americans
under  harsh
rule
or
brought
on
in
his
dominions  revolution
like
that
which
he
precipitated
at
home
in
he
determined
to
unite
the
northern
colonies
and
introduce  more
efficient
administration
based
on
the
pattern
of
the
royal
provinces
he
made  martinet
sir
edmund
andros
governor
of
all
new
england
new
york
and
new

the
charter
of
massachusetts
annulled
in
the
last
days
of
his

he
continued
to
ignore
and
that

would
have
been
seized
if
it
had
not
been
spirited
away
and
hidden
according
to
tradition
in  hollow
oak
for
several
months
andros
gave
the
northern
colonies  taste
of
ill
tempered
despotism
he
wrung
quit
rents
from
land
owners
not
accustomed
to
feudal
dues
he
abrogated
titles
to
land
where
in
his
opinion
they
were
unlawful
he
forced
the
episcopal
service
upon
the
old
south
church
in
boston
and
he
denied
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
to  preacher
who
denounced
taxation
without
representation
in
the
middle
of
his
arbitrary
course
however
his
hand
was
stayed
the
news
came
that
king
james
had
been
dethroned
by
his
angry
subjects
and
the
people
of
boston
kindling  fire
on
beacon
hill
summoned
the
countryside
to
dispose
of
andros
the
response
was
prompt
and
hearty
the
hated
governor
was
arrested
imprisoned
and
sent
back
across
the
sea
under
guard
the
overthrow
of
james
followed
by
the
accession
of
william
and
mary
and
by
assured
parliamentary
supremacy
had
an
immediate
effect
in
the
colonies
the
new
order
was
greeted
with
thanksgiving
massachusetts
was
given
another
charter
which
though
not
so
liberal
as
the
first
restored
the
spirit
if
not
the
entire
letter
of
self
government
in
the
other
colonies
where
andros
had
been
operating
the
old
course
of
affairs
was
resumed
the
indifference
of
the
first
two
georges
on
the
death
in
of
queen
anne
the
successor
of
king
william
the
throne
passed
to  hanoverian
prince
who
though
grateful
for
english
honors
and
revenues
was
more
interested
in
hanover
than
in
england
george  and
george
ii
whose
combined
reigns
extended
from
to
never
even
learned
to
speak
the
english
language
at
least
without
an
accent
the
necessity
of
taking
thought
about
colonial
affairs
bored
both
of
them
so
that
the
stoutest
defender
of
popular
privileges
in
boston
or
charleston
had
no
ground
to
complain
of
the
exercise
of
personal
prerogatives
by
the
king
moreover
during  large
part
of
this
period
the
direction
of
affairs
was
in
the
hands
of
an
astute
leader
sir
robert
walpole
who
betrayed
his
somewhat
cynical
view
of
politics
by
adopting
as
his
motto
let
sleeping
dogs
lie
he
revealed
his
appreciation
of
popular
sentiment
by
exclaiming  will
not
be
the
minister
to
enforce
taxes
at
the
expense
of
blood
such
kings
and
such
ministers
were
not
likely
to
arouse

slumbering
resistance
of

over

no
english
ruler
from

to

ventured
to

matters
personally
constant
control
over
the
colonies
was
exercised
by
royal
officers
acting
under
the
authority
of
the
crown
systematic
supervision
began
in
when
there
was
created
by
royal
order  committee
of
the
king  council
to
meet
on
mondays
and
thursdays
of
each
week
to
consider
petitions
memorials
and
addresses
respecting
the
plantations
in  regular
board
was
established
known
as
the
lords
of
trade
and
plantations
which
continued
until
the
american
revolution
to
scrutinize
closely
colonial
business
the
chief
duties
of
the
board
were
to
examine
acts
of
colonial
legislatures
to
recommend
measures
to
those
assemblies
for
adoption
and
to
hear
memorials
and
petitions
from
the
colonies
relative
to
their
affairs
the
methods
employed
by
this
board
were
varied
all
laws
passed
by
american
legislatures
came
before
it
for
review
as  matter
of
routine
if
it
found
an
act
unsatisfactory
it
recommended
to
the
king
the
exercise
of
his
veto
power
known
as
the
royal
disallowance
any
person
who
believed
his
personal
or
property
rights
injured
by  colonial
law
could
be
heard
by
the
board
in
person
or
by
attorney
in
such
cases
it
was
the
practice
to
hear
at
the
same
time
the
agent
of
the
colony
so
involved
the
royal
veto
power
over
colonial
legislation
was
not
therefore  formal
affair
but
was
constantly
employed
on
the
suggestion
of  highly
efficient
agency
of
the
crown
all
this
was
in
addition
to
the
powers
exercised
by
the
governors
in
the
royal
provinces
judicial
control
supplementing
this
administrative
control
over
the
colonies
was  constant

by

english
courts
of

the
king
by
virtue
of
his
inherent
authority
claimed

exercised
high
appellate
powers
over
all
judicial
tribunals
in

the
right
of
appeal
from

courts
expressly
set
forth
in

on

in

america
who
in
the
regular
legal
course
was
aggrieved
by
any
act
of  colonial

any
decision
of  colonial

had
the
right
subject
to

to
carry

the
machinery
for

at
one

indians  superior
judicial
power
towering
above
that
of
the
colonies
as
the
supreme
court
at
washington
now
towers
above
the
states
kept
the
colonial
legislatures
within
the
metes
and
bounds
of
established
law
in
the
thousands
of
appeals
memorials
petitions
and
complaints
and
the
rulings
and
decisions
upon
them
were
written
the
real
history
of
british
imperial
control
over
the
american
colonies
so
great
was
the
business
before
the
lords
of
trade
that
the
colonies
had
to
keep
skilled
agents
in
london
to
protect
their
interests
as
common
grievances
against
the
operation
of
this
machinery
of
control
arose
there
appeared
in
each
colony  considerable
body
of
men
with
the
merchants
in
the
lead
who
chafed
at
the
restraints
imposed
on
their
enterprise
only  powerful
blow
was
needed
to
weld
these
bodies
into  common
mass
nourishing
the
spirit
of
colonial
nationalism
when
to
the
repeated
minor
irritations
were
added
general
and
sweeping
measures
of
parliament
applying
to
every
colony
the
rebound
came
in
the
revolution
parliamentary
control
over
colonial
affairs
as
soon
as
parliament
gained
in
power
at
the
expense
of
the
king
it
reached
out
to
bring
the
american
colonies
under
its
sway
as
well
between
the
execution
of
charles  and
the
accession
of
george
iii
there
was
enacted
an
immense
body
of
legislation
regulating
the
shipping
trade
and
manufactures
of
america
all
of
it
based
on
the
mercantile
theory
then
prevalent
in
all
countries
of
europe
was
designed
to
control
the
overseas
plantations
in
such  way
as
to
foster
the
commercial
and
business
interests
of
the
mother
country
where
merchants
and
men
of
finance
had
got
the
upper
hand
according
to
this
theory
the
colonies
of
the
british
empire
should
be
confined
to
agriculture
and
the
production
of
raw
materials
and
forced
to
buy
their
manufactured
goods
of
england
the
navigation
acts
in
the
first
rank
among
these
measures
of
british
colonial
policy
must
be
placed
the
navigation
laws
framed
for
the
purpose
of
building
up
the
british
merchant
marine
and
navy
arms
so
essential
in
defending
the
colonies
against
the
spanish
dutch
and
french
the
beginning
of
this
type
of
legislation
was
made
in
and
it
was
worked
out
into  system
early
in
the
reign
of
charles
ii
the
navigation
acts
in
effect
gave  monopoly
of
colonial
commerce
to
british
ships
no
trade
could
be
carried
on
between
great
britain
and
her
dominions
save
in
vessels
built
and
manned
by
british
subjects
no
european
goods
could
be
brought
to
america
save
in
the
ships
of
the
country
that
produced
them
or
in
english
ships
these
laws
which
were
almost
fatal
to
dutch
shipping
in
america
fell
with
severity
upon
the
colonists
compelling
them
to
pay
higher
freight
rates
the
adverse
effect
however
was
short
lived
for
the
measures
stimulated
shipbuilding
in
the
colonies
where
the
abundance
of
raw
materials
gave
the
master
builders
of
america
an
advantage
over
those
of
the
mother
country
thus
the
colonists
in
the
end
profited
from
the
restrictive
policy
written
into
the
navigation
acts
the
acts
against
manufactures
the
second
group
of
laws
was
deliberately
aimed
to
prevent
colonial
industries
from
competing
too
sharply
with
those
of
england
among
the
earliest
of
these
measures
may
be
counted
the
woolen
act
of
forbidding
the
exportation
of
woolen
goods
from
the
colonies
and
even
the
woolen
trade
between
towns
and
colonies
when
parliament
learned
as
the
result
of
an
inquiry
that
new
england
and
new
york
were
making
thousands
of
hats  year
and
sending
large
numbers
annually
to
the
southern
colonies
and
to
ireland
spain
and
portugal
it
enacted
in  law
declaring
that
no
hats
or
felts
dyed
or
undyed
finished
or
unfinished
should
be
put
upon
any
vessel
or
laden
upon
any
horse
or
cart
with
intent
to
export
to
any
place
whatever
the
effect
of
this
measure
upon
the
hat
industry
was
almost
ruinous  few
years
later  similar
blow
was
given
to
the
iron
industry
by
an
act
of
pig
and
bar
iron
from
the
colonies
were
given
free
entry
to
england
to
encourage
the
production
of
the
raw
material
but
at
the
same
time
the
law
provided
that
no
mill
or
other
engine
for
slitting
or
rolling
of
iron
no
plating
forge
to
work
with  tilt
hammer
and
no
furnace
for
making
steel
should
be
built
in
the
colonies
as
for
those
already
built
they
were
declared
public
nuisances
and
ordered
closed
thus
three
important
economic
interests
of
the
colonists
the
woolen
hat
and
iron
industries
were
laid
under
the
ban
the
trade
laws
the
third
group
of
restrictive
measures
passed
by
the
british
parliament
related
to
the
sale
of
colonial
produce
an
act
of
required
the
colonies
to
export
certain
articles
to
great
britain
or
to
her
dominions
alone
while
sugar
tobacco
and
ginger
consigned
to
the
continent
of
europe
had
to
pass
through  british
port
paying
custom
duties
and
through  british
merchant  hands
paying
the
usual
commission
at
first
tobacco
was
the
only
one
of
the
enumerated
articles
which
seriously
concerned
the
american
colonies
the
rest
coming
mainly
from
the
british
west
indies
in
the
course
of
time
however
other
commodities
were
added
to
the
list
of
enumerated
articles
until
by
it
embraced
rice
naval
stores
copper
furs
hides
iron
lumber
and
pearl
ashes
this
was
not
all
the
colonies
were
compelled
to
bring
their
european
purchases
back
through
english
ports
paying
duties
to
the
government
and
commissions
to
merchants
again
the
molasses
act
not
content
with
laws
enacted
in
the
interest
of
english
merchants
and
manufacturers
parliament
sought
to
protect
the
british
west
indies
against
competition
from
their
french
and
dutch
neighbors
new
england
merchants
had
long
carried
on  lucrative
trade
with
the
french
islands
in
the
west
indies
and
dutch
guiana
where
sugar
and
molasses
could
be
obtained
in
large
quantities
at
low
prices
acting
on
the
protests
of
english
planters
in
the
barbadoes
and
jamaica
parliament
in
passed
the
famous
molasses
act
imposing
duties
on
sugar
and
molasses
imported
into
the
colonies
from
foreign
countries
rates
which
would
have
destroyed
the
american
trade
with
the
french
and
dutch
if
the
law
had
been
enforced
the
duties
however
were
not
collected
the
molasses
and
sugar
trade
with
the
foreigners
went
on
merrily
smuggling
taking
the
place
of
lawful
traffic
effect
of
the
laws
in
america
as
compared
with
the
strict
monopoly
of
her
colonial
trade
which
spain
consistently
sought
to
maintain
the
policy
of
england
was
both
moderate
and
liberal
furthermore
the
restrictive
laws
were
supplemented
by
many
measures
intended
to
be
favorable
to
colonial
prosperity
the
navigation
acts
for
example
redounded
to
the
advantage
of
american
shipbuilders
and
the
producers
of
hemp
tar
lumber
and
ship
stores
in
general
favors
in
british
ports
were
granted
to
colonial
producers
as
against
foreign
competitors
and
in
some
instances
bounties
were
paid
by
england
to
encourage
colonial
enterprise
taken
all
in
all
there
is
much
justification
in
the
argument
advanced
by
some
modern
scholars
to
the
effect
that
the
colonists
gained
more
than
they
lost
by
british
trade
and
industrial
legislation
certainly
after
the
establishment
of
independence
when
free
from
these
old
restrictions
the
americans
found
themselves
handicapped
by
being
treated
as
foreigners
rather
than
favored
traders
and
the
recipients
of
bounties
in
english
markets
be
that
as
it
may
it
appears
that
the
colonists
felt
little
irritation
against
the
mother
country
on
account
of
the
trade
and
navigation
laws
enacted
previous
to
the
close
of
the
french
and
indian
war
relatively
few
were
engaged
in
the
hat
and
iron
industries
as
compared
with
those
in
farming
and
planting
so
that
england  policy
of
restricting
america
to
agriculture
did
not
conflict
with
the
interests
of
the
majority
of
the
inhabitants
the
woolen
industry
was
largely
in
the
hands
of
women
and
carried
on
in
connection
with
their
domestic
duties
so
that
it
was
not
the
sole
support
of
any
considerable
number
of
people
as  matter
of
fact
moreover
the
restrictive
laws
especially
those
relating
to
trade
were
not
rigidly
enforced
cargoes
of
tobacco
were
boldly
sent
to
continental
ports
without
even
so
much
as  bow
to
the
english
government
to
which
duties
should
have
been
paid
sugar
and
molasses
from
the
french
and
dutch
colonies
were
shipped
into
new
england
in
spite
of
the
law
royal
officers
sometimes
protested
against
smuggling
and
sometimes
connived
at
it
but
at
no
time
did
they
succeed
in
stopping
it
taken
all
in
all
very
little
was
heard
of
the
galling
restraints
of
trade
until
after
the
french
war
when
the
british
government
suddenly
entered
upon  new
course
summary
of
the
colonial
period
in
the
period
between
the
landing
of
the
english
at
jamestown
virginia
in
and
the
close
of
the
french
and
indian
war
in  period
of  century
and  half  new
nation
was
being
prepared
on
this
continent
to
take
its
place
among
the
powers
of
the
earth
it
was
an
epoch
of
migration
western
europe
contributed
emigrants
of
many
races
and
nationalities
the
english
led
the
way
next
to
them
in
numerical
importance
were
the
scotch
irish
and
the
germans
into
the
melting
pot
were
also
cast
dutch
swedes
french
jews
welsh
and
irish
thousands
of
negroes
were
brought
from
africa
to
till
southern
fields
or
labor
as
domestic
servants
in
the
north
why
did
they
come
the
reasons
are
various
some
of
them
the
pilgrims
and
puritans
of
new
england
the
french
huguenots
scotch
irish
and
irish
and
the
catholics
of
maryland
fled
from
intolerant
governments
that
denied
them
the
right
to
worship
god
according
to
the
dictates
of
their
consciences
thousands
came
to
escape
the
bondage
of
poverty
in
the
old
world
and
to
find
free
homes
in
america
thousands
like
the
negroes
from
africa
were
dragged
here
against
their
will
the
lure
of
adventure
appealed
to
the
restless
and
the
lure
of
profits
to
the
enterprising
merchants
how
did
they
come
in
some
cases
religious
brotherhoods
banded
together
and
borrowed
or
furnished
the
funds
necessary
to
pay
the
way
in
other
cases
great
trading
companies
were
organized
to
found
colonies
again
it
was
the
wealthy
proprietor
like
lord
baltimore
or
william
penn
who
undertook
to
plant
settlements
many
immigrants
were
able
to
pay
their
own
way
across
the
sea
others
bound
themselves
out
for  term
of
years
in
exchange
for
the
cost
of
the
passage
negroes
were
brought
on
account
of
the
profits
derived
from
their
sale
as
slaves
whatever
the
motive
for
their
coming
however
they
managed
to
get
across
the
sea
the
immigrants
set
to
work
with  will
they
cut
down
forests
built
houses
and
laid
out
fields
they
founded
churches
schools
and
colleges
they
set
up
forges
and
workshops
they
spun
and
wove
they
fashioned
ships
and
sailed
the
seas
they
bartered
and
traded
here
and
there
on
favorable
harbors
they
established
centers
of
commerce
boston
providence
new
york
philadelphia
baltimore
and
charleston
as
soon
as  firm
foothold
was
secured
on
the
shore
line
they
pressed
westward
until
by
the
close
of
the
colonial
period
they
were
already
on
the
crest
of
the
alleghanies
though
they
were
widely
scattered
along  thousand
miles
of
seacoast
the
colonists
were
united
in
spirit
by
many
common
ties
the
major
portion
of
them
were
protestants
the
language
the
law
and
the
literature
of
england
furnished
the
basis
of
national
unity
most
of
the
colonists
were
engaged
in
the
same
hard
task
that
of
conquering  wilderness
to
ties
of
kinship
and
language
were
added
ties
created
by
necessity
they
had
to
unite
in
defense
first
against
the
indians
and
later
against
the
french
they
were
all
subjects
of
the
same
sovereign
the
king
of
england
the
english
parliament
made
laws
for
them
and
the
english
government
supervised
their
local
affairs
their
trade
and
their
manufactures
common
forces
assailed
them
common
grievances
vexed
them
common
hopes
inspired
them
many
of
the
things
which
tended
to
unite
them
likewise
tended
to
throw
them
into
opposition
to
the
british
crown
and
parliament
most
of
them
were
freeholders
that
is
farmers
who
owned
their
own
land
and
tilled
it
with
their
own
hands  free
soil
nourished
the
spirit
of
freedom
the
majority
of
them
were
dissenters
critics
not
friends
of
the
church
of
england
that
stanch
defender
of
the
british
monarchy
each
colony
in
time
developed
its
own
legislature
elected
by
the
voters
it
grew
accustomed
to
making
laws
and
laying
taxes
for
itself
here
was  people
learning
self
reliance
and
self
government
the
attempts
to
strengthen
the
church
of
england
in
america
and
the
transformation
of
colonies
into
royal
provinces
only
fanned
the
spirit
of
independence
which
they
were
designed
to
quench
nevertheless
the
americans
owed
much
of
their
prosperity
to
the
assistance
of
the
government
that
irritated
them
it
was
the
protection
of
the
british
navy
that
prevented
holland
spain
and
france
from
wiping
out
their
settlements
though
their
manufacture
and
trade
were
controlled
in
the
interests
of
the
mother
country
they
also
enjoyed
great
advantages
in
her
markets
free
trade
existed
nowhere
upon
the
earth
but
the
broad
empire
of
britain
was
open
to
american
ships
and
merchandise
it
could
be
said
with
good
reason
that
the
disadvantages
which
the
colonists
suffered
through
british
regulation
of
their
industry
and
trade
were
more
than
offset
by
the
privileges
they
enjoyed
still
that

the
new
king
the
third
george
rudely
broke
the
german
tradition
of
his
family
he
resented
the
imputation
that
he
was  foreigner
and
on
all
occasions
made  display
of
his
british
sympathies
to
the
draft
of
his
first
speech
to
parliament
he
added
the
popular
phrase
born
and

certainly

no
liking

royal
prerogative
said
of
george
the
young
king
was  born
englishman
all
his
tastes
and
habits
good
and
bad
were
english
no
portion
of
his
subjects
had
anything
to
reproach
him
with
his
age
his
appearance
and
all
that
was
known
of
his
character
conciliated
public
favor
he
was
in
the
bloom
of
youth
his
person
and
address
were
pleasing
scandal
imputed
to
him
no
vice
and
flattery
might
without
glaring
absurdity
ascribe
to
him
many
princely
virtues
nevertheless
george
iii
had
been
spoiled
by
his
mother
his
tutors
and
his
courtiers
under
their
influence
he
developed
high
and
mighty
notions
about
the
sacredness
of
royal
authority
and
his
duty
to
check
the
pretensions
of
parliament
and
the
ministers
dependent
upon
it
his
mother
had
dinned
into
his
ears
the
slogan
george
be
king
lord
bute
his
teacher
and
adviser
had
told
him
that
his
honor
required
him
to
take
an
active
part
in
the
shaping
of
public
policy
and
the
making
of
laws
thus
educated
he
surrounded
himself
with
courtiers
who
encouraged
him
in
the
determination
to
rule
as
well
as
reign
to
subdue
all
parties
and
to
place
himself
at
the
head
of
the
nation
and
empire

parties
and
george
iii
the
state
of
the
political
parties
favored
the
plans
of
the
king
to
restore
some
of
the
ancient
luster
of
the
crown
the
whigs
who
were
composed
mainly
of
the
smaller
freeholders
merchants
inhabitants
of
towns
and
protestant
non
conformists
had
grown
haughty
and
overbearing
through
long
continuance
in
power
and
had
as  consequence
raised
up
many
enemies
in
their
own
ranks
their
opponents
the
tories
had
by
this
time
given
up
all
hope
of
restoring
to
the
throne
the
direct
stuart
line
but
they
still
cherished
their
old
notions
about
divine
right
with
the
accession
of
george
iii
the
coveted
opportunity
came
to
them
to
rally
around
the
throne
again
george
received
his
tory
friends
with
open
arms
gave
them
offices
and
bought
them
seats
in
the
house
of
commons
the
british
parliamentary
system
the
peculiarities
of
the
british
parliament
at
the
time
made
smooth
the
way
for
the
king
and
his
allies
with
their
designs
for
controlling
the
entire
government
in
the
first
place
the
house
of
lords
was
composed
mainly
of
hereditary
nobles
whose
number
the
king
could
increase
by
the
appointment
of
his
favorites
as
of
old
though
the
members
of
the
house
of
commons
were
elected
by
popular
vote
they
did
not
speak
for
the
mass
of
english
people
great
towns
like
leeds
manchester
and
birmingham
for
example
had
no
representatives
at
all
while
there
were
about
eight
million
inhabitants
in
great
britain
there
were
in
only
about
voters
that
is
to
say
only
about
one
in
every
ten
adult
males
had  voice
in
the
government
many
boroughs
returned
one
or
more
members
to
the
commons
although
they
had
merely  handful
of
voters
or
in
some
instances
no
voters
at
all
furthermore
these
tiny
boroughs
were
often
controlled
by
lords
who
openly
sold
the
right
of
representation
to
the
highest
bidder
the
rotten
boroughs
as
they
were
called
by
reformers
were  public
scandal
but
george
iii
readily
made
use
of
them
to
get
his
friends
into
the
house
of

and
their
colonial
policies

and

after

william

was
turned
out
of

the
king
treating
him
with
gross
incivility
and
the
crowds

the
direction
of
affairs
was
entrusted
to
men
enjoying

in
the
house
of

fell
to
george
grenville  grave
and
laborious
man
who
for
years
had
groaned
over
the
increasing
cost
of
government
the
first
task
after
the
conclusion
of
peace
in
was
the
adjustment
of
the
disordered
finances
of
the
kingdom
the
debt
stood
at
the
highest
point
in
the
history
of
the
country
more
revenue
was
absolutely
necessary
and
grenville
began
to
search
for
it
turning
his
attention
finally
to
the
american
colonies
in
this
quest
he
had
the
aid
of  zealous
colleague
charles
townshend
who
had
long
been
in
public
service
and
was
familiar
with
the
difficulties
encountered
by
royal
governors
in
america
these
two
men
with
the
support
of
the
entire
ministry
inaugurated
in
february  new
system
of
colonial
government
it
was
announced
by
authority
that
there
were
to
be
no
more
requisitions
from
the
king
to
the
colonial
assemblies
for
supplies
but
that
the
colonies
were
to
be
taxed
instead
by
act
of
parliament
colonial
governors
and
judges
were
to
be
paid
by
the
crown
they
were
to
be
supported
by  standing
army
of
twenty
regiments
and
all
the
expenses
of
this
force
were
to
be
met
by
parliamentary
taxation
restriction
of
paper
money
among
the
many
complaints
filed
before
the
board
of
trade
were
vigorous
protests
against
the
issuance
of
paper
money
by
the
colonial
legislatures
the
new
ministry
provided  remedy
in
the
act
of
which
declared
void
all
colonial
laws
authorizing
paper
money
or
extending
the
life
of
outstanding
bills
this
law
was
aimed
at
the
cheap
money
which
the
americans
were
fond
of
making
when
specie
was
scarce
money
which
they
tried
to
force
on
their
english
creditors
in
return
for
goods
and
in
payment
of
the
interest
and
principal
of
debts
thus
the
first
chapter
was
written
in
the
long
battle
over
sound
money
on
this
continent
limitation
on
western
land
sales
later
in
the
same
year
george
iii
issued  royal
proclamation
providing
among
other
things
for
the
government
of
the
territory
recently
acquired
by
the
treaty
of
paris
from
the
french
one
of
the
provisions
in
this
royal
decree
touched
frontiersmen
to
the
quick
the
contests
between
the
king  officers
and
the
colonists
over
the
disposition
of
western
lands
had
been
long
and
sharp
the
americans
chafed
at
restrictions
on
settlement
the
more
adventurous
were
continually
moving
west
and
squatting
on
land
purchased
from
the
indians
or
simply
seized
without
authority
to
put
an
end
to
this
the
king
forbade
all
further
purchases
from
the
indians
reserving
to
the
crown
the
right
to
acquire
such
lands
and
dispose
of
them
for
settlement  second
provision
in
the
same
proclamation
vested
the
power
of
licensing
trade
with
the
indians
including
the
lucrative
fur
business
in
the
hands
of
royal
officers
in
the
colonies
these
two
limitations
on
american
freedom
and
enterprise
were
declared
to
be
in
the
interest
of
the
crown
and
for
the
preservation
of
the
rights
of
the
indians
against
fraud
and
abuses
the
sugar
act
of
king
george  ministers
next
turned
their
attention
to
measures
of
taxation
and
trade
since
the
heavy
debt
under
which
england
was
laboring
had
been
largely
incurred
in
the
defense
of
america
nothing
seemed
more
reasonable
to
them
than
the
proposition
that
the
colonies
should
help
to
bear
the
burden
which
fell
so
heavily
upon
the
english
taxpayer
the
sugar
act
of
was
the
result
of
this
reasoning
there
was
no
doubt
about
the
purpose
of
this
law
for
it
was
set
forth
clearly
in
the
title
an
act
for
granting
certain
duties
in
the
british
colonies
and
plantations
in
america
for
applying
the
produce
of
such
duties
towards
defraying
the
expenses
of
defending
protecting
and
securing
the
said
colonies
and
plantations
and
for
more
effectually
preventing
the
clandestine
conveyance
of
goods
to
and
from
the
said
colonies
and
plantations
and
improving
and
securing
the
trade
between
the
same
and
great
britain
the
old
molasses
act
had
been
prohibitive
the
sugar
act
of
was
clearly
intended
as  revenue
measure
specified
duties
were
laid
upon
sugar
indigo
calico
silks
and
many
other
commodities
imported
into
the
colonies
the
enforcement
of
the
molasses
act
had
been
utterly
neglected
but
this
sugar
act
had
teeth
in
it
special
precautions
as
to
bonds
security
and
registration
of
ship
masters
accompanied
by
heavy
penalties
promised  vigorous
execution
of
the
new
revenue
law
the
strict
terms
of
the
sugar
act
were
strengthened
by
administrative
measures
under  law
of
the
previous
year
the
commanders
of
armed
vessels
stationed
along
the
american
coast
were
authorized
to
stop
search
and
on
suspicion
seize
merchant
ships
approaching
colonial
ports
by
supplementary
orders
the
entire
british
official
force
in
america
was
instructed
to
be
diligent
in
the
execution
of
all
trade
and
navigation
laws
revenue
collectors
officers
of
the
army
and
navy
and
royal
governors
were
curtly
ordered
to
the
front
to
do
their
full
duty
in
the
matter
of
law
enforcement
the
ordinary
motives
for
the
discharge
of
official
obligations
were
sharpened
by
an
appeal
to
avarice
for
naval
officers
who
seized
offenders
against
the
law
were
rewarded
by
large
prizes
out
of
the
forfeitures
and
penalties
the
stamp
act
the
grenville
townshend
combination
moved
steadily
towards
its
goal
while
the
sugar
act
was
under
consideration
in
parliament
grenville
announced  plan
for  stamp
bill
the
next
year
it
went
through
both
houses
with  speed
that
must
have
astounded
its
authors
the
vote
in
the
commons
stood
in
favor
to
against
while
in
the
lords
it
was
not
even
necessary
to
go
through
the
formality
of  count
as
george
iii
was
temporarily
insane
the
measure
received
royal
assent
by  commission
acting
as  board
of
regency
protests
of
colonial
agents
in
london
were
futile
we
might
as
well
have
hindered
the
sun  progress
exclaimed
franklin
protests
of  few
opponents
in
the
commons
were
equally
vain
the
ministry
was
firm
in
its
course
and
from
all
appearances
the
stamp
act
hardly
roused
as
much
as  languid
interest
in
the
city
of
london
in
fact
it
is
recorded
that
the
fateful
measure
attracted
less
notice
than  bill
providing
for  commission
to
act
for
the
king
when
he
was
incapacitated
the
stamp
act
like
the
sugar
act
declared
the
purpose
of
the
british
government
to
raise
revenue
in
america
towards
defraying
the
expenses
of
defending
protecting
and
securing
the
british
colonies
and
plantations
in
america
it
was  long
measure
of
more
than
fifty
sections
carefully
planned
and
skillfully
drawn
by
its
provisions
duties
were
imposed
on
practically
all
papers
used

the
drag
net
was

knit
for
scarcely
anything
escaped
the
quartering
act
the
ministers
were
aware
that
the
stamp
act
would
rouse
opposition
in
america
how
great
they
could
not
conjecture
while
the
measure
was
being
debated  friend
of
general
wolfe
colonel
barre
who
knew
america
well
gave
them
an
ominous
warning
in
the
commons
believe
me
remember  this
day
told
you
so
he
exclaimed
the
same
spirit
of
freedom
which
actuated
that
people
at
first
will
accompany
them
still  people
jealous
of
their
liberties
and
who
will
vindicate
them
if
ever
they
should
be
violated
the
answer
of
the
ministry
to  prophecy
of
force
was  threat
of
force
preparations
were
accordingly
made
to
dispatch  larger
number
of
soldiers
than
usual
to
the
colonies
and
the
ink
was
hardly
dry
on
the
stamp
act
when
parliament
passed
the
quartering
act
ordering
the
colonists
to
provide
accommodations
for
the
soldiers
who
were
to
enforce
the
new
laws
we
have
the
power
to
tax
them
said
one
of
the
ministry
and
we
will
tax
them
colonial
resistance

repeal
popular
opposition
the
stamp
act
was
greeted
in
america
by
an
outburst
of
denunciation
the
merchants
of
the
seaboard
cities
took
the
lead
in
making  dignified
but
unmistakable
protest
agreeing
not
to
import
british
goods
while
the
hated
law
stood
upon
the
books
lawyers
some
of
them
incensed
at
the
heavy
taxes
on
their
operations
and
others
intimidated
by
patriots
who
refused
to
permit
them
to
use
stamped
papers
joined
with
the
merchants
aristocratic
colonial
whigs
who
had
long
grumbled
at
the
administration
of
royal
governors
protested
against
taxation
without
their
consent
as
the
whigs
had
done
in
old
england
there
were
tories
however
in
the
colonies
as
in
england
many
of
them
of
the
official
class
who
denounced
the
merchants
lawyers
and
whig
aristocrats
as
seditious
factious
and
republican
yet
the
opposition
to
the
stamp
act
and
its
accompanying
measure
the
quartering
act
grew
steadily
all
through
the
summer
of
in  little
while
it
was
taken
up
in
the
streets
and
along
the
countryside
all
through
the
north
and
in
some
of
the
southern
colonies
there
sprang
up
as
if
by
magic
committees
and
societies
pledged
to
resist
the
stamp
act
to
the
bitter
end
these
popular
societies
were
known
as
sons
of
liberty
and
daughters
of
liberty
the
former
including
artisans
mechanics
and
laborers
and
the
latter
patriotic
women
both
groups
were
alike
in
that
they
had
as
yet
taken
little
part
in
public
affairs
many
artisans
as
well
as
all
the
women
were
excluded
from
the
right
to
vote
for
colonial
assemblymen
while
the
merchants
and
whig
gentlemen
confined
their
efforts
chiefly
to
drafting
well
phrased
protests
against
british
measures
the
sons
of
liberty
operated
in
the
streets
and
chose
rougher
measures
they
stirred
up
riots
in
boston
new
york
philadelphia
and
charleston
when
attempts
were
made
to
sell
the
stamps
they
sacked
and
burned
the
residences
of
high
royal
officers
they
organized
committees
of
inquisition
who
by
threats
and
intimidation
curtailed
the
sale
of
british
goods
and
the
use
of
stamped
papers
in
fact
the
sons
of
liberty
carried
their
operations
to
such
excesses
that
many
mild
opponents
of
the
stamp
tax
were
frightened
and
drew
back
in
astonishment
at
the
forces
they
had
unloosed
the
daughters
of
liberty
in  quieter
way
were
making  very
effective
resistance
to
the
sale
of
the
hated
goods
by
spurring
on
domestic
industries
their
own
particular
province
being
the
manufacture
of

substitutes
for

responded

the
warmest
affection
for

firmly
spread
on

of

of
no
double
meaning
they
declared
that

could
not

without
their
consent
given
through
their
respective
colonial
assemblies
that
the
stamp

showed  tendency
to
subvert

and
grievous
and
that

repeal
of
the
stamp
act
and
the
sugar
act
the
effect
of
american
resistance
on
opinion
in
england
was
telling
commerce
with
the
colonies
had
been
effectively
boycotted
by
the
americans
ships
lay

swinging
at
the
wharves
bankruptcy
threatened
hundreds
of
merchants
in
london
bristol
and
liverpool
workingmen
in
the
manufacturing
towns
of
england
were
thrown
out
of
employment
the
government
had
sown
folly
and
was
reaping
in
place
of
the
coveted
revenue
rebellion
perplexed
by
the
storm
they
had
raised
the
ministers
summoned
to
the
bar
of
the
house
of
commons
benjamin
franklin
the
agent
for
pennsylvania
who
was
in
london
do
you
think
it
right
asked
grenville
that
america
should
be
protected
by
this
country
and
pay
no
part
of
the
expenses
the
answer
was
brief
that
is
not
the
case
the
colonies
raised
clothed
and
paid
during
the
last
war
twenty
five
thousand
men
and
spent
many
millions
then
came
an
inquiry
whether
the
colonists
would
accept  modified
stamp
act
no
never
replied
franklin
never
they
will
never
submit
to
it
it
was
next
suggested
that
military
force
might
compel
obedience
to
law
franklin
had  ready
answer
they
cannot
force  man
to
take
stamps
they
may
not
find  rebellion
they
may
indeed
make
one
the
repeal
of
the
stamp
act
was
moved
in
the
house
of
commons  few
days
later
the
sponsor
for
the
repeal
spoke
of
commerce
interrupted

merchants

threatened
pitt
and
edmund
burke
the
former
near
the
close
of
his
career
the
latter
just
beginning
his
argued
cogently
in
favor
of
retracing
the
steps
taken
the
year
before
grenville
refused
america
must
learn
he
wailed
that
prayers
are
not
to
be
brought
to
caesar
through
riot
and
sedition
his
protests
were
idle
the
commons
agreed
to
the
repeal
on
february
amid
the
cheers
of
the
victorious
majority
it
was
carried
through
the
lords
in
the
face
of
strong
opposition
and
on
march
reluctantly
signed
by
the
king
now
restored
to
his
right
mind
in
rescinding
the
stamp
act
parliament
did
not
admit
the
contention
of
the
americans
that
it
was
without
power
to
tax
them
on
the
contrary
it
accompanied
the
repeal
with  declaratory
act
it
announced
that
the
colonies
were
subordinate
to
the
crown
and
parliament
of
great
britain
that
the
king
and
parliament
therefore
had
undoubted
authority
to
make
laws
binding
the
colonies
in
all
cases
whatsoever
and
that
the
resolutions
and
proceedings
of
the
colonists
denying
such
authority
were
null
and
void
the
repeal
was
greeted
by
the
colonists
with
great
popular
demonstrations
bells
were
rung
toasts
to
the
king
were
drunk
and
trade
resumed
its
normal
course
the
declaratory
act
as  mere
paper
resolution
did
not
disturb
the
good
humor
of
those
who
again
cheered
the
name
of
king
george
their
confidence
was
soon
strengthened
by
the
news
that
even
the
sugar
act
had
been
repealed
thus
practically
restoring
the
condition
of
affairs
before
grenville
and
townshend
inaugurated
their
policy
of
thoroughness
resumption
of
british
revenue
and
commercial
policies
the
townshend
acts
the
triumph
of
the
colonists
was
brief
though
pitt
the
friend
of
america
was
once
more
prime
minister
and
seated
in
the
house
of
lords
as
the
earl
of
chatham
his
severe
illness
gave
to
townshend
and
the
tory
party
practical
control
over
parliament
unconvinced
by
the
experience
with
the
stamp
act
townshend
brought
forward
and
pushed
through
both
houses
of
parliament
three
measures
which
to
this
day
are
associated
with
his
name
first
among
his
restrictive
laws
was
that
of
june
which
placed
the
enforcement
of
the
collection
of
duties
and
customs
on
colonial
imports
and
exports
in
the
hands
of
british
commissioners
appointed
by
the
king
resident
in
the
colonies
paid
from
the
british
treasury
and
independent
of
all
control
by
the
colonists
the
second
measure
of
the
same
date
imposed  tax
on
lead
glass
paint
tea
and  few
other
articles
imported
into
the
colonies
the
revenue
derived
from
the
duties
to
be
applied
toward
the
payment
of
the
salaries
and
other
expenses
of
royal
colonial
officials  third
measure
was
the
tea
act
of
july
aimed
at
the
tea
trade
which
the
americans
carried
on
illegally
with
foreigners
this
law
abolished
the
duty
which
the
east
india
company
had
to
pay
in
england
on
tea
exported
to
america
for
it
was
thought
that
english
tea
merchants
might
thus
find
it
possible
to
undersell
american
tea
smugglers
writs
of
assistance
legalized
by
parliament
had
parliament
been
content
with
laying
duties
just
as  manifestation
of
power
and
right
and
neglected
their
collection
perhaps
little
would
have
been
heard
of
the
townshend
acts
it
provided
however
for
the
strict
even
the
harsh
enforcement
of
the
law
it
ordered
customs
officers
to
remain
at
their
posts
and
put
an
end
to
smuggling
in
the
revenue
act
of
june
it
expressly
authorized
the
superior
courts
of
the
colonies
to
issue
writs
of
assistance
empowering
customs
officers
to
enter
any
house
warehouse
shop
cellar
or
other
place
in
the
british
colonies
or
plantations
in
america
to
search
for
and
seize
prohibited
or
smuggled
goods
the
writ
of
assistance
which
was  general
search
warrant
issued
to
revenue
officers
was
an
ancient
device
hateful
to  people
who
cherished
the
spirit
of
personal
independence
and
who
had
made
actual
gains
in
the
practice
of
civil
liberty
to
allow  minion
of
the
law
to
enter  man  house
and
search
his
papers
and
premises
was
too
much
for
the
emotions
of
people
who
had
fled
to
america
in  quest
for
self
government
and
free
homes
who
had
braved
such
hardships
to
establish
them
and
who
wanted
to
trade
without
official
interference
the
writ
of
assistance
had
been
used
in
massachusetts
in
to
prevent
illicit
trade
with
canada
and
had
aroused  violent
hostility
at
that
time
in
it
was
again
the
subject
of  bitter
controversy
which
arose
in
connection
with
the
application
of  customs
officer
to  massachusetts
court
for
writs
of
assistance
as
usual
this
application
was
vainly
opposed
by
james
otis
in  speech
of
five
hours
duration  speech
of
such
fire
and
eloquence
that
it
sent
every
man
who
heard
it
away
ready
to
take
up
arms
against
writs
of
assistance
otis
denounced
the
practice
as
an
exercise
of
arbitrary
power
which
had
cost
one
king
his
head
and
another
his
throne  tyrant  device
which
placed
the
liberty
of
every
man
in
jeopardy
enabling
any
petty
officer
to
work
possible
malice
on
any
innocent
citizen
on
the
merest
suspicion
and
to
spread
terror
and
desolation
through
the
land
what  scene
he
exclaimed
does
this
open
every
man
prompted
by
revenge
ill
humor
or
wantonness
to
inspect
the
inside
of
his
neighbor  house
may
get  writ
of
assistance
others
will
ask
it
from
self
defense
one
arbitrary
exertion
will
provoke
another
until
society
is
involved
in
tumult
and
blood
he
did
more
than
attack
the
writ
itself
he
said
that
parliament
could
not
establish
it
because
it
was
against
the
british
constitution
this
was
an
assertion
resting
on
slender
foundation
but
it
was
quickly
echoed
by
the
people
then
and
there
james
otis
sounded
the
call
to
america
to
resist
the
exercise
of
arbitrary
power
by
royal
officers
then
and
there
wrote
john
adams
the
child
independence
was
born
such
was
the
hated
writ
that
townshend
proposed
to
put
into
the
hands
of
customs
officers
in
his
grim
determination
to
enforce
the
law
the
new
york
assembly
suspended
in
the
very
month
that
townshend  acts
were
signed
by
the
king
parliament
took  still
more
drastic
step
the
assembly
of
new
york
protesting
against
the
ruinous
and
insupportable
expense
involved
had
failed
to
make
provision
for
the
care
of
british
troops
in
accordance
with
the
terms
of
the
quartering
act
parliament
therefore
suspended
the
assembly
until
it
promised
to
obey
the
law
it
was
not
until  third
election
was
held
that
compliance
with
the
quartering
act
was
wrung
from
the
reluctant
province
in
the
meantime
all
the
colonies
had
learned
on
how
frail  foundation
their
representative
bodies
rested
renewed
resistance
in
america
the
massachusetts
circular
massachusetts
under
the
leadership
of
samuel
adams
resolved
to
resist
the
policy
of
renewed
intervention
in
america
at
his
suggestion
the
assembly
adopted  circular
letter
addressed
to
the
assemblies
of
the
other
colonies
informing
them
of
the
state
of
affairs
in
massachusetts
and
roundly
condemning
the
whole
british
program
the
circular
letter
declared
that
parliament
had
no
right
to
lay
taxes
on
americans
without
their
consent
and
that
the
colonists
could
not
from
the
nature
of
the
case
be
represented
in
parliament
it
went
on
shrewdly
to
submit
to
consideration
the
question
as
to
whether
any
people
could
be
called
free
who
were
subjected
to
governors
and
judges
appointed
by
the
crown
and
paid
out
of
funds
raised
independently
it
invited
the
other
colonies
in
the
most
temperate
tones
to
take
thought
about
the
common
predicament
in
which
they
were
all
placed
illustration
from
an
old
print
samuel
adams
the
dissolution
of
assemblies
the
governor
of
massachusetts
hearing
of
the
circular
letter
ordered
the
assembly
to
rescind
its
appeal
on
meeting
refusal
he
promptly
dissolved
it
the
maryland
georgia
and
south
carolina
assemblies
indorsed
the
circular
letter
and
were
also
dissolved
at
once
the
virginia
house
of
burgesses
thoroughly
aroused
passed
resolutions
on
may
declaring
that
the
sole
right
of
imposing
taxes
in
virginia
was
vested
in
its
legislature
asserting
anew
the
right
of
petition
to
the
crown
condemning
the
transportation
of
persons
accused
of
crimes
or
trial
beyond
the
seas
and
beseeching
the
king
for  redress
of
the
general
grievances
the
immediate
dissolution
of
the
virginia
assembly
in
its
turn
was
the
answer
of
the
royal
governor
the
boston
massacre
american
opposition
to
the
british
authorities
kept
steadily
rising
as
assemblies
were
dissolved
the
houses
of
citizens
searched
and
troops
distributed
in
increasing
numbers
among
the
centers
of
discontent
merchants
again
agreed
not
to
import

goods
the

renewed
their
agitation

set
about
the
patronage
of

more
loyally
on
the
night
of
march  crowd
on
the
streets
of
boston
began
to
jostle
and
tease
some
british
regulars
stationed
in
the
town
things
went
from
bad
to
worse
until
some
boys
and
young
fellows
began
to
throw
snowballs
and
stones
then
the
exasperated
soldiers
fired
into
the
crowd
killing
five
and
wounding
half  dozen
more
the
day
after
the
massacre  mass
meeting
was
held
in
the
town
and
samuel
adams
was
sent
to
demand
the
withdrawal
of
the
soldiers
the
governor
hesitated
and
tried
to
compromise
finding
adams
relentless
the
governor
yielded
and
ordered
the
regulars
away
the
boston
massacre
stirred
the
country
from
new
hampshire
to
georgia
popular
passions
ran
high
the
guilty
soldiers
were
charged
with
murder
their
defense
was
undertaken
in
spite
of
the
wrath
of
the
populace
by
john
adams
and
josiah
quincy
who
as
lawyers
thought
even
the
worst
offenders
entitled
to
their
full
rights
in
law
in
his
speech
to
the
jury
however
adams
warned
the
british
government
against
its
course
saying
that
from
the
nature
of
things
soldiers
quartered
in  populous
town
will
always
occasion
two
mobs
where
they
will
prevent

the
year
following
the
boston
massacre
some
citizens
of
north
carolina
goaded
by
the
conduct
of
the
royal
governor
openly
resisted
his
authority
many
were
killed
as  result
and
seven
who
were
taken
prisoners
were
hanged
as
traitors  little
later
royal
troops
and
local
militia
met
in  pitched
battle
near
alamance
river
called
the
lexington
of

south

affair
and
the
virginia
resolutions
of
on

as
well
as
on

friction
between
the
royal
officers
and
the
colonists
broke
out
into
overt
acts
while
patrolling
narragansett
bay
looking
for
smugglers
one
day
in
the
armed
ship
gaspee
ran
ashore
and
was
caught
fast
during
the
night
several
men
from
providence
boarded
the
vessel
and
after
seizing
the
crew
set
it
on
fire  royal
commission
sent
to
rhode
island
to
discover
the
offenders
and
bring
them
to
account
failed
because
it
could
not
find  single
informer
the
very
appointment
of
such  commission
aroused
the
patriots
of
virginia
to
action
and
in
march
the
house
of
burgesses
passed  resolution
creating  standing
committee
of
correspondence
to
develop
cooperation
among
the
colonies
in
resistance
to
british
measures
the
boston
tea
party
although
the
british
government
finding
the
townshend
revenue
act  failure
repealed
in
all
the
duties
except
that
on
tea
it
in
no
way
relaxed
its
resolve
to
enforce
the
other
commercial
regulations
it
had
imposed
on
the
colonies
moreover
parliament
decided
to
relieve
the
british
east
india
company
of
the
financial
difficulties
into
which
it
had
fallen
partly
by
reason
of
the
tea
act
and
the
colonial
boycott
that
followed
in
it
agreed
to
return
to
the
company
the
regular
import
duties
levied
in
england
on
all
tea
transshipped
to
america  small
impost
of
three
pence
to
be
collected
in
america
was
left
as  reminder
of
the
principle
laid
down
in
the
declaratory
act
that
parliament
had
the
right
to
tax
the
colonists
this
arrangement
with
the
east
india
company
was
obnoxious
to
the
colonists
for
several
reasons
it
was
an
act
of
favoritism
for
one
thing
in
the
interest
of  great
monopoly
for
another
thing
it
promised
to
dump
on
the
american
market
suddenly
an
immense
amount
of
cheap
tea
and
so
cause
heavy
losses
to
american
merchants
who
had
large
stocks
on
hand
it
threatened
with
ruin
the
business
of
all
those
who
were
engaged
in
clandestine
trade
with
the
dutch
it
carried
with
it
an
irritating
tax
of
three
pence
on
imports
in
charleston
annapolis
new
york
and
boston
captains
of
ships
who
brought
tea
under
this
act
were
roughly
handled
one
night
in
december  band
of
boston
citizens
disguised
as
indians
boarded
the
hated
tea
ships
and
dumped
the
cargo
into
the
harbor
this
was
serious
business
for
it
was
open
flagrant
determined
violation
of
the
law
as
such
the
british
government
viewed
it
retaliation
by
the
british
government
reception
of
the
news
of
the
tea
riot
the
news
of
the
tea
riot
in
boston
confirmed
king
george
in
his
conviction
that
there
should
be
no
soft
policy
in
dealing
with
his
american
subjects
the
die
is
cast
he
stated
with
evident
satisfaction
the
colonies
must
either
triumph
or
submit
if
we
take
the
resolute
part
they
will
undoubtedly
be
very
meek
lord
george
germain
characterized
the
tea
party
as
the
proceedings
of  tumultuous
and
riotous
rabble
who
ought
if
they
had
the
least
prudence
to
follow
their
mercantile
employments
and
not
trouble
themselves
with
politics
and
government
which
they
do
not
understand
this
expressed
in
concise
form
exactly
the
sentiments
of
lord
north
who
had
then
for
three
years
been
the
king  chief
minister
even
pitt
lord
chatham
was
prepared
to
support
the
government
in
upholding
its
authority
the
five
intolerable
acts
parliament
beginning
on
march
passed
five
stringent
measures
known
in
american
history
as
the
five
intolerable
acts
they
were
aimed
at
curing
the
unrest
in
america
the
first
of
them
was  bill
absolutely
shutting
the
port
of
boston
to
commerce
with
the
outside
world
the
second
following
closely
revoked
the
massachusetts
charter
of
and
provided
furthermore
that
the
councilors
should
be
appointed
by
the
king
that
all
judges
should
be
named
by
the
royal
governor
and
that
town
meetings
except
to
elect
certain
officers
could
not
be
held
without
the
governor  consent  third
measure
after
denouncing
the
utter
subversion
of
all
lawful
government
in
the
provinces
authorized
royal
agents
to
transfer
to
great
britain
or
to
other
colonies
the
trials
of
officers
or
other
persons
accused
of
murder
in
connection
with
the
enforcement
of
the
law
the
fourth
act
legalized
the
quartering
of
troops
in
massachusetts
towns
the
fifth
of
the
measures
was
the
quebec
act
which
granted
religious
toleration
to
the
catholics
in
canada
extended
the
boundaries
of
quebec
southward
to
the
ohio
river
and
established
in
this
western
region
government
by  viceroy
the
intolerable
acts
went
through
parliament
with
extraordinary
celerity
there
was
an
opposition
alert
and
informed
but
it
was
ineffective
burke
spoke
eloquently
against
the
boston
port
bill
condemning
it
roundly
for
punishing
the
innocent
with
the
guilty
and
showing
how
likely
it
was
to
bring
grave
consequences
in
its
train
he
was
heard
with
respect
and
his
pleas
were
rejected
the
bill
passed
both
houses
without  division
the
entry
unanimous
being
made
upon
their
journals
although
it
did
not
accurately
represent
the
state
of
opinion
the
law
destroying
the
charter
of
massachusetts
passed
the
commons
by  vote
of
three
to
one
and
the
third
intolerable
act
by  vote
of
four
to
one
the
triumph
of
the
ministry
was
complete
what
passed
in
boston
exclaimed
the
great
jurist
lord
mansfield
is
the
overt
act
of
high
treason
proceeding
from
our
over
lenity
and
want
of
foresight
the
crown
and
parliament
were
united
in
resorting
to
punitive
measures
in
the
colonies
the
laws
were
received
with
consternation
to
the
american
protestants
the
quebec
act
was
the
most
offensive
that
project
they
viewed
not
as
an
act
of
grace
or
of
mercy
but
as  direct
attempt
to
enlist
french
canadians
on
the
side
of
great
britain
the
british
government
did
not
grant
religious
toleration
to
catholics
either
at
home
or
in
ireland
and
the
americans
could
see
no
good
motive
in
granting
it
in
north
america
the
act
was
also
offensive
because
massachusetts
connecticut
and
virginia
had
under
their
charters
large
claims
in
the
territory
thus
annexed
to
quebec
to
enforce
these
intolerable
acts
the
military
arm
of
the
british
government
was
brought
into
play
the
commander
in
chief
of
the
armed
forces
in
america
general
gage
was
appointed
governor
of
massachusetts
reinforcements
were
brought
to
the
colonies
for
now
king
george
was
to
give
the
rebels
as
he
called
them  taste
of
strong
medicine
the
majesty
of
his
law
was
to
be
vindicated
by
force
from
reform
to
revolution
in
america
the
doctrine
of
natural
rights
the
dissolution
of
assemblies
the
destruction
of
charters
and
the
use
of
troops
produced
in
the
colonies  new
phase
in
the
struggle
in
the
early
days
of
the
contest
with
the
british
ministry
the
americans
spoke
of
their
rights
as
englishmen
and
condemned
the
acts
of
parliament
as
unlawful
as
violating
the
principles
of
the
english
constitution
under
which
they
all
lived
when
they
saw
that
such
arguments
had
no
effect
on
parliament
they
turned
for
support
to
their
natural
rights
the
latter
doctrine
in
the
form
in
which
it
was
employed
by
the
colonists
was
as
english
as
the
constitutional
argument
john
locke
had
used
it
with
good
effect
in
defense
of
the
english
revolution
in
the
seventeenth
century
american
leaders
familiar
with
the
writings
of
locke
also
took
up
his
thesis
in
the
hour
of
their
distress
they
openly
declared
that
their
rights
did
not
rest
after
all
upon
the
english
constitution
or  charter
from
the
crown
old
magna
carta
was
not
the
beginning
of
all
things
retorted
otis
when
the
constitutional
argument
failed  time
may
come
when
parliament
shall
declare
every
american
charter
void
but
the
natural
inherent
and
inseparable
rights
of
the
colonists
as
men
and
as
citizens
would
remain
and
whatever
became
of
charters
can
never
be
abolished
until
the
general
conflagration
of
the
same
opinion
was
the
young
and
impetuous
alexander
hamilton
the
sacred
rights
of
mankind
he
exclaimed
are
not
to
be
rummaged
for
among
old
parchments
or
musty
records
they
are
written
as
with  sunbeam
in
the
whole
volume
of
human
destiny
by
the
hand
of
divinity
itself
and
can
never
be
erased
or
obscured
by
mortal
power
firm
as
the
american
leaders
were
in
the
statement
and
defense
of
their
rights
there
is
every
reason
for
believing
that
in
the
beginning
they
hoped
to
confine
the
conflict
to
the
realm
of
opinion
they
constantly
avowed
that
they
were
loyal
to
the
king
when
protesting
in
the
strongest
language
against
his
policies
even
otis
regarded
by
the
loyalists
as  firebrand
was
in
fact
attempting
to
avert
revolution
by
winning
concessions
from
england  argue
this
cause
with
the
greater
pleasure
he
solemnly
urged
in
his
speech
against
the
writs
of
assistance
as
it
is
in
favor
of
british
liberty
and
as
it
is
in
opposition
to  kind
of
power
the
exercise
of
which
in
former
periods
cost
one
king
of
england
his
head
and
another
his
throne
burke
offers
the
doctrine
of
conciliation
the
flooding
tide
of
american
sentiment
was
correctly
measured
by
one
englishman
at
least
edmund
burke
who
quickly
saw
that
attempts
to
restrain
the
rise
of
american
democracy
were
efforts
to
reverse
the
processes
of
nature
he
saw
how
fixed
and
rooted
in
the
nature
of
things
was
the
american
spirit
how
inevitable
how
irresistible
he
warned
his
countrymen
that
there
were
three
ways
of
handling
the
delicate
situation
and
only
three
one
was
to
remove
the
cause
of
friction
by
changing
the
spirit
of
the
colonists
an
utter
impossibility
because
that
spirit
was
grounded
in
the
essential
circumstances
of
american
life
the
second
was
to
prosecute
american
leaders
as
criminals
of
this
he
begged
his
countrymen
to
beware
lest
the
colonists
declare
that  government
against
which  claim
of
liberty
is
tantamount
to
high
treason
is  government
to
which
submission
is
equivalent
to
slavery
the
third
and
right
way
to
meet
the
problem
burke
concluded
was
to
accept
the
american
spirit
repeal
the
obnoxious
measures
and
receive
the
colonies
into
equal
partnership
events
produce
the
great
decision
the
right
way
indicated
by
burke
was
equally
impossible
to
george
iii
and
the
majority
in
parliament
to
their
narrow
minds
american
opinion
was
contemptible
and
american
resistance
unlawful
riotous
and
treasonable
the
correct
way
in
their
view
was
to
dispatch
more
troops
to
crush
the
rebels
and
that
very
act
took
the
contest
from
the
realm
of
opinion
as
john
adams
said
facts
are
stubborn
things
opinions
were
unseen
but
marching
soldiers
were
visible
to
the
veriest
street
urchin
now
said
gouverneur
morris
the
sheep
simple
as
they
are
cannot
be
gulled
as
heretofore
it
was
too
late
to
talk
about
the
excellence
of
the
british
constitution
if
any
one
is
bewildered
by
the
controversies
of
modern
historians
as
to
why
the
crisis
came
at
last
he

when

acts
reached

every
one
knew
what
strong
medicine
parliament
was
prepared
to
administer
to
all
those
who
resisted
its
authority
the
cause
of

became
the
cause
of

opposition

policy
hitherto
local
and
spasmodic
now
took
on  national
character
to
local
committees
and
provincial
conventions
was
added  continental
congress
appropriately
called
by
massachusetts
on
june
at
the
instigation
of
samuel
adams
the
response
to
the
summons
was
electric
by
hurried
and
irregular
methods
delegates
were
elected
during
the
summer
and
on
september
the
congress
duly
assembled
in
carpenter  hall
in
philadelphia
many
of
the
greatest
men
in
america
were
there
george
washington
and
patrick
henry
from
virginia
and
john
and
samuel
adams
from
massachusetts
every
shade
of
opinion
was
represented
some
were
impatient
with
mild
devices
the
majority
favored
moderation
the
congress
drew
up  declaration
of
american
rights
and
stated
in
clear
and
dignified
language
the
grievances
of
the
colonists
it
approved
the
resistance
to
british
measures
offered
by
massachusetts
and
promised
the
united
support
of
all
sections
it
prepared
an
address
to
king
george
and
another
to
the
people
of
england
disavowing
the
idea
of
independence
but
firmly
attacking
the
policies
pursued
by
the
british
government
the
non
importation
agreement
the
congress
was
not
content
however
with
professions
of
faith
and
with
petitions
it
took
one
revolutionary
step
it
agreed
to
stop
the
importation
of
british
goods
into
america
and
the
enforcement
of
this
agreement
it
placed
in
the
hands
of
local
committees
of
safety
and
inspection
to
be
elected
by
the
qualified
voters
the
significance
of
this
action
is
obvious
congress
threw
itself
athwart
british
law
it
made  rule
to
bind
american
citizens
and
to
be
carried
into
effect
by
american
officers
it
set
up  state
within
the
british
state
and
laid
down  test
of
allegiance
to
the
new
order
the
colonists
who
up
to
this
moment
had
been
wavering
had
to
choose
one
authority
or
the
other
they
were
for
the
enforcement
of
the
non
importation
agreement
or
they
were
against
it
they
either
bought
english
goods
or
they
did
not
in
the
spirit
of
the
toast
may
britain
be
wise
and
america
be
free

of

american
congress
reached

and
burke
warmly
urged  repeal
of
the
obnoxious
laws
but
in
vain
all
they
could
wring
from
the
prime
minister
lord
north
was  set
of
conciliatory
resolutions
proposing
to
relieve
from
taxation
any
colony
that
would
assume
its
share
of
imperial
defense
and
make
provision
for
supporting
the
local
officers
of
the
crown
this
olive
branch
was
accompanied
by  resolution
assuring
the
king
of
support
at
all
hazards
in
suppressing
the
rebellion
and
by
the
restraining
act
of
march
which
in

and

at

the
second
continental
congress
which
met
at
philadelphia
in
may
was
not
yet
convinced
that
conciliation
was
beyond
human
power
it
petitioned
the
king
to
interpose
on
behalf
of
the
colonists
in
order
that
the
empire
might
avoid
the
calamities
of
civil
war
on
the
last
day
of
july
it
made  temperate
but
firm
answer
to
lord
north  offer
of
conciliation
stating
that
the
proposal
was
unsatisfactory
because
it
did
not
renounce
the
right
to
tax
or
repeal
the
offensive
acts

the
british

as
the

of

were
about
to
present
the
last

this
announcement
declared
that
the

misled
by
dangerous
and
ill
designing
men
were
in  state
of
insurrection

on
the
civil
and

powers
to
bring
the
traitors
to
justice
and
it
threatened
with
condign
punishment
the
authors
perpetrators
and
abettors
of
such
traitorous
designs
it
closed
with
the
usual
prayer
god

in

year

passed  sweeping
act
destroying
all

although
the
congress
had
not
given
up
all
hope
of
reconciliation
in
the
spring
and
summer
of
it
had
firmly
resolved
to
defend
american
rights
by
arms
if
necessary
it
transformed
the
militiamen
who
had
assembled
near
boston
after
the
battle
of

into  continental
army

washington
as

was
the

on

such
was
long
afterward

conservative

lecky
the
conduct

the
great
decision
in

among
all
classes
the
question
of
the
hour
was
being
debated
american
independence
as
the
historian
bancroft
says
was
not
an
act
of
sudden
passion
nor
the
work

of
the
government
that
the
crown
is
not
as
oppressive
in
england
as
in
turkey
having
thus
summarily
swept
away
the
grounds
of
allegiance
to
the
old
order
paine
proceeded
relentlessly
to
an
argument
for
immediate
separation
from
great
britain
there
was
nothing
in
the
sphere
of
practical
interest
he
insisted
which
should
bind
the
colonies
to
the
mother
country
allegiance
to
her
had
been
responsible
for
the
many
wars
in
which
they
had
been
involved
reasons
of
trade
were
not
less
weighty
in
behalf
of
independence
our
corn
will
fetch
its
price
in
any
market
in
europe
and
our
imported
goods
must
be
paid
for
buy
them
where
we
will
as
to
matters
of
government
it
is
not
in
the
power
of
britain
to
do
this
continent
justice
the
business
of
it
will
soon
be
too
weighty
and
intricate
to
be
managed
with
any
tolerable
degree
of
convenience
by  power
so
distant
from
us
and
so
very
ignorant
of
us
there
is
accordingly
no
alternative
to
independence
for
america
everything
that
is
right
or
natural
pleads
for
separation
the
blood
of
the
slain
the
weeping
voice
of
nature
cries
tis
time
to
part

the
last
resort
must
decide
the
contest
the
appeal
was
the
choice
of
the

the

accepted
the
challenge
the
sun
never
shone
on  cause
of

tis
not
the
affair
of  city  county  province
or  kingdom
but
of  continent
tis
not
the

of  day  year
or
an

posterity
is
involved
in

and
will
be

that

ye
that

the

but
the
tyrant
stand
forth
let
names
of
whig
and

be
extinct
let
none
other
be
heard
among
us
than
those
of  good
citizen
an
open
and
resolute
friend
and  virtuous
supporter
of
the
rights
of
mankind
and
of
the
free
and
independent
states
of
america
as
more
than
copies
were
scattered
broadcast
over
the
country
patriots
exclaimed
with
washington
sound
doctrine
and
unanswerable
reason
the
drift
of
events
toward
independence
official
support
for
the
idea
of
independence
began
to
come
from
many
quarters
on
the
tenth
of
february
gadsden
in
the
provincial
convention
of
south
carolina
advocated  new
constitution
for
the
colony
and
absolute
independence
for
all
america
the
convention
balked
at
the
latter
but
went
half
way
by
abolishing
the
system
of
royal
administration
and
establishing  complete
plan
of
self
government  month
later
on
april
the
neighboring
state
of
north
carolina
uttered
the
daring
phrase
from
which
others
shrank
it
empowered
its
representatives
in
the
congress
to
concur
with
the
delegates
of
the
other
colonies
in
declaring
independence
rhode
island
massachusetts
and
virginia
quickly
responded
to
the
challenge
the
convention
of
the
old
dominion
on
may
instructed
its
delegates
at
philadelphia
to
propose
the
independence
of
the
united
colonies
and
to
give
the
assent
of
virginia
to
the
act
of
separation
when
the
resolution
was
carried
the
british
flag
on
the
state
house
was
lowered
for
all
time
meanwhile
the
continental
congress
was
alive
to
the
course
of
events
outside
the
subject
of
independence
was
constantly
being
raised
are
we
rebels
exclaimed
wyeth
of
virginia
during  debate
in
february
no
we
must
declare
ourselves  free
people
others
hesitated
and
spoke
of
waiting
for
the
arrival
of
commissioners
of
conciliation
is
not
america
already
independent
asked
samuel
adams  few
weeks
later
why
not
then
declare
it
still
there
was
uncertainty
and
delegates
avoided
the
direct
word  few
more
weeks
elapsed
at
last
on
may
congress
declared
that
the
authority
of
the
british
crown
in
america
must
be
suppressed
and
advised
the
colonies
to
set
up
governments
of
their
own
illustration
from
an
old
print
thomas
jefferson
reading
his
draft
of
the
declaration
of
independence
to
the
committee
of
congress
independence
declared
the
way
was
fully
prepared
therefore
when
on
june
the
virginia
delegation
in
the
congress
moved
that
these
united
colonies
are
and
of
right
ought
to
be
free
and
independent
states  committee
was
immediately
appointed
to
draft  formal
document
setting
forth
the
reasons
for
the
act
and
on
july
all
the
states
save
new
york
went
on
record
in
favor
of
severing
their
political
connection
with
great
britain
two
days
later
july
jefferson  draft
of
the
declaration
of
independence
changed
in
some
slight
particulars
was
adopted
the
old
bell
in
independence
hall
as
it
is
now
known
rang
out
the
glad
tidings
couriers
swiftly
carried
the
news
to
the
uttermost
hamlet
and
farm  new
nation
announced
its
will
to
have  place
among
the
powers
of
the
world
to
some
documents
is
given
immortality
the
declaration
of
independence
is
one
of
them
american
patriotism
is
forever
associated
with
it
but
patriotism
alone
does
not
make
it
immortal
neither
does
the
vigor
of
its
language
or
the
severity
of
its
indictment
give
it  secure
place
in
the
records
of
time
the
secret
of
its
greatness
lies
in
the
simple
fact
that
it
is
one
of
the
memorable
landmarks
in
the
history
of  political
ideal
which
for
three
centuries
has
been
taking
form
and
spreading
throughout
the
earth
challenging
kings
and
potentates
shaking
down
thrones
and
aristocracies
breaking
the
armies
of
irresponsible
power
on
battle
fields
as
far
apart
as
marston
moor
and
chateau
thierry
that
ideal
now
so
familiar
then
so
novel
is
summed
up
in
the
simple
sentence
governments
derive
their
just
powers
from
the
consent
of
the
governed
written
in  decent
respect
for
the
opinions
of
mankind
to
set
forth
the
causes
which
impelled
the
american
colonists
to
separate
from
britain
the
declaration
contained  long
list
of
abuses
and
usurpations
which
had
induced
them
to
throw
off
the
government
of
king
george
that
section
of
the
declaration
has
passed
into
ancient
history
and
is
seldom
read
it
is
the
part
laying
down  new
basis
for
government
and
giving  new
dignity
to
the
common
man
that
has
become  household
phrase
in
the
old
world
as
in
the
new
in
the
more
enduring
passages
there
are
four
fundamental
ideas
which
from
the
standpoint
of
the
old
system
of
government
were
the
essence
of
revolution
all
men
are
created
equal
and
are
endowed
by
their
creator
with
certain
unalienable
rights
including
life
liberty
and
the
pursuit
of
happiness
the
purpose
of
government
is
to
secure
these
rights
governments
derive
their
just
powers
from
the
consent
of
the
governed
whenever
any
form
of
government
becomes
destructive
of
these
ends
it
is
the
right
of
the
people
to
alter
or
abolish
it
and
institute
new
government
laying
its
foundations
on
such
principles
and
organizing
its
powers
in
such
form
as
to
them
shall
seem
most
likely
to
effect
their
safety
and
happiness
here
was
the
prelude
to
the
historic
drama
of
democracy  challenge
to
every
form
of
government
and
every
privilege
not
founded
on
popular
assent
the
establishment
of
government
and
the
new
allegiance
the
committees
of
correspondence
as
soon
as
debate
had
passed
into
armed
resistance
the
patriots
found
it
necessary
to
consolidate
their
forces
by
organizing
civil
government
this
was
readily
effected
for
the
means
were
at
hand
in
town
meetings
provincial
legislatures
and
committees
of
correspondence
the
working
tools
of
the
revolution
were
in
fact
the
committees
of
correspondence
small
local
unofficial
groups
of
patriots
formed
to
exchange
views
and
create
public
sentiment
as
early
as
november
such  committee
had
been
created
in
boston
under
the
leadership
of
samuel
adams
it
held
regular
meetings
sent
emissaries
to
neighboring
towns
and
carried
on  campaign
of
education
in
the
doctrines
of
liberty
illustration
the
colonies
of
north
america
at
the
time
of
the
declaration
of
independence
upon
local
organizations
similar
in
character
to
the
boston
committee
were
built
county
committees
and
then
the
larger
colonial
committees
congresses
and
conventions
all
unofficial
and
representing
the
revolutionary
elements
ordinarily
the
provincial
convention
was
merely
the
old
legislative
assembly
freed
from
all
royalist
sympathizers
and
controlled
by
patriots
finally
upon
these
colonial
assemblies
was
built
the
continental
congress
the
precursor
of
union
under
the
articles
of
confederation
and
ultimately
under
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
this
was
the
revolutionary
government
set
up
within
the
british
empire
in
america
state
constitutions
framed
with
the
rise
of
these
new
assemblies
of
the
people
the
old
colonial
governments
broke
down
from
the
royal
provinces
the
governor
the
judges
and
the
high
officers
fled
in
haste
and
it
became
necessary
to
substitute
patriot
authorities
the
appeal
to
the
colonies
advising
them
to
adopt  new
form
of
government
for
themselves
issued
by
the
congress
in
may
was
quickly
acted
upon
before
the
expiration
of  year
virginia
new
jersey
pennsylvania
delaware
maryland
georgia
and
new
york
had
drafted
new
constitutions
as
states
not
as
colonies
uncertain
of
their
destinies
connecticut
and
rhode
island
holding
that
their
ancient
charters
were
equal
to
their
needs
merely
renounced
their
allegiance
to
the
king
and
went
on
as
before
so
far
as
the
form
of
government
was
concerned
south
carolina
which
had
drafted  temporary
plan
early
in
drew
up  new
and
more
complete
constitution
in
two
years
later
massachusetts
with
much
deliberation
put
into
force
its
fundamental
law
which
in
most
of
its
essential
features
remains
unchanged
to
day
the
new
state
constitutions
in
their
broad
outlines
followed
colonial
models
for
the
royal
governor
was
substituted  governor
or
president
chosen
usually
by
the
legislature
but
in
two
instances
new
york
and
massachusetts
by
popular
vote
for
the
provincial
council
there
was
substituted
except
in
georgia  senate
while
the
lower
house
or
assembly
was
continued
virtually
without
change
the
old
property
restriction
on
the
suffrage
though
lowered
slightly
in
some
states
was
continued
in
full
force
to
the
great
discontent
of
the
mechanics
thus
deprived
of
the
ballot
the
special
qualifications
laid
down
in
several
constitutions
for
governors
senators
and
representatives
indicated
that
the
revolutionary
leaders
were
not
prepared
for
any
radical
experiments
in
democracy
the
protests
of  few
women
like
mrs
john
adams
of
massachusetts
and
mrs
henry
corbin
of
virginia
against  government
which
excluded
them
from
political
rights
were
treated
as
mild
curiosities
of
no
significance
although
in
new
jersey
women
were
allowed
to
vote
for
many
years
on
the
same
terms
as
men
by
the
new
state
constitutions
the
signs
and
symbols
of
royal
power
of
authority
derived
from
any
source
save
the
people
were
swept
aside
and
republican
governments
on
an
imposing
scale
presented
for
the
first
time
to
the
modern
world
copies
of
these
remarkable
documents
prepared
by
plain
citizens
were
translated
into
french
and
widely
circulated
in
europe
there
they
were
destined
to
serve
as  guide
and
inspiration
to  generation
of
constitution
makers
whose
mission
it
was
to
begin
the
democratic
revolution
in
the
old
world
the
articles
of
confederation
the
formation
of
state
constitutions
was
an
easy
task
for
the
revolutionary
leaders
they
had
only
to
build
on
foundations
already
laid
the
establishment
of  national
system
of
government
was
another
matter
there
had
always
been
it
must
be
remembered  system
of
central
control
over
the
colonies
but
americans
had
had
little
experience
in
its
operation
when
the
supervision
of
the
crown
of
great
britain
was
suddenly
broken
the
patriot
leaders
accustomed
merely
to
provincial
statesmanship
were
poorly
trained
for
action
on  national
stage
many
forces
worked
against
those
who
like
franklin
had  vision
of
national
destiny
there
were
differences
in
economic
interest
commerce
and
industry
in
the
north
and
the
planting
system
of
the
south
there
were
contests
over
the
apportionment
of
taxes
and
the
quotas
of
troops
for
common
defense
to
these
practical
difficulties
were
added
local
pride
the
vested
rights
of
state
and
village
politicians
in
their
provincial
dignity
and
the
scarcity
of
men
with  large
outlook
upon
the
common
enterprise
nevertheless
necessity
compelled
them
to
consider
some
sort
of
federation
the
second
continental
congress
had
hardly
opened
its
work
before
the
most
sagacious
leaders
began
to
urge
the
desirability
of  permanent
connection
as
early
as
july
congress
resolved
to
go
into  committee
of
the
whole
on
the
state
of
the
union
and
franklin
undaunted
by
the
fate
of
his
albany
plan
of
twenty
years
before
again
presented  draft
of  constitution
long
and
desultory
debates
followed
and
it
was
not
until
late
in
that
congress
presented
to
the
states
the
articles
of
confederation
provincial
jealousies
delayed
ratification
and
it
was
the
spring
of  few
months
before
the
surrender
of
cornwallis
at
yorktown
when
maryland
the
last
of
the
states
approved
the
articles
this
plan
of
union
though
it
was
all
that
could
be
wrung
from
the
reluctant
states
provided
for
neither  chief
executive
nor  system
of
federal
courts
it
created
simply  congress
of
delegates
in
which
each
state
had
an
equal
voice
and
gave
it
the
right
to
call
upon
the
state
legislatures
for
the
sinews
of
government
money
and
soldiers
the
application
of
tests
of
allegiance
as
the
successive
steps
were
taken
in
the
direction
of
independent
government
the
patriots
devised
and
applied
tests
designed
to
discover
who
were
for
and
who
were
against
the
new
nation
in
the
process
of
making
when
the
first
continental
congress
agreed
not
to
allow
the
importation
of
british
goods
it
provided
for
the
creation
of
local
committees
to
enforce
the
rules
such
agencies
were
duly
formed
by
the
choice
of
men
favoring
the
scheme
all
opponents
being
excluded
from
the
elections
before
these
bodies
those
who
persisted
in
buying
british
goods
were
summoned
and
warned
or
punished
according
to
circumstances
as
soon
as
the
new
state
constitutions
were
put
into
effect
local
committees
set
to
work
in
the
same
way
to
ferret
out
all
who
were
not
outspoken
in
their
support
of
the
new
order
of
things
illustration
mobbing
the
tories
these
patriot
agencies
bearing
different
names
in
different
sections
were
sometimes
ruthless
in
their
methods
they
called
upon
all
men
to
sign
the
test
of
loyalty
frequently
known
as
the
association
test
those
who
refused
were
promptly
branded
as
outlaws
while
some
of
the
more
dangerous
were
thrown
into
jail
the
prison
camp
in
connecticut
at
one
time
held
the
former
governor
of
new
jersey
and
the
mayor
of
new
york
thousands
were
black
listed
and
subjected
to
espionage
the
black
list
of
pennsylvania
contained
the
names
of
nearly
five
hundred
persons
of
prominence
who
were
under
suspicion
loyalists
or
tories
who
were
bold
enough
to
speak
and
write
against
the
revolution
were
suppressed
and
their
pamphlets
burned
in
many
places
particularly
in
the
north
the
property
of
the
loyalists
was
confiscated
and
the
proceeds
applied
to
the
cause
of
the
revolution
the
work
of
the
official
agencies
for
suppression
of
opposition
was
sometimes
supplemented
by
mob
violence  few
tories
were
hanged
without
trial
and
others
were
tarred
and
feathered
one
was
placed
upon  cake
of
ice
and
held
there
until
his
loyalty
to
king
george
might
cool
whole
families
were
driven
out
of
their
homes
to
find
their
way
as
best
they
could
within
the
british
lines
or
into
canada
where
the
british
government
gave
them
lands
such
excesses
were
deplored
by
washington
but
they
were
defended
on
the
ground
that
in
effect  civil
war
as
well
as  war
for
independence
was
being
waged
the
patriots
and
tories
thus
by
one
process
or
another
those
who
were
to
be
citizens
of
the
new
republic
were
separated
from
those
who
preferred
to
be
subjects
of
king
george
just
what
proportion
of
the
americans
favored
independence
and
what
share
remained
loyal
to
the
british
monarchy
there
is
no
way
of
knowing
the
question
of
revolution
was
not
submitted
to
popular
vote
and
on
the
point
of
numbers
we
have
conflicting
evidence
on
the
patriot
side
there
is
the
testimony
of  careful
and
informed
observer
john
adams
who
asserted
that
two
thirds
of
the
people
were
for
the
american
cause
and
not
more
than
one
third
opposed
the
revolution
at
all
stages
on
behalf
of
the
loyalists
or
tories
as
they
were
popularly
known
extravagant
claims
were
made
joseph
galloway
who
had
been  member
of
the
first
continental
congress
and
had
fled
to
england
when
he
saw
its
temper
testified
before  committee
of
parliament
in
that
not
one
fifth
of
the
american
people
supported
the
insurrection
and
that
many
more
than
four

with

when

and
were
harried
from

into

he
knew
the
effect
of
such

on

as
well
as
on

in

he
made  second
great

the

the

which
he
had

while

he
refuted
the
charge
that

by

he

look

and

over
it
his
ringing
call
to
arms
was
followed
by
another
and
another
until
the
long
contest
was
over
military
affairs
the
two
phases
of
the
war
the
war
which
opened
with
the
battle
of
lexington
on
april
and
closed
with
the
surrender
of
cornwallis
at
yorktown
on
october
passed
through
two
distinct
phases
the
first
lasting
until
the
treaty
of
alliance
with
france
in
and
the
second
until
the
end
of
the
struggle
during
the
first
phase
the
war
was
confined
mainly
to
the
north
the
outstanding
features
of
the
contest
were
the
evacuation
of
boston
by
the
british
the
expulsion
of
american
forces
from
new
york
and
their
retreat
through
new
jersey
the
battle
of
trenton
the
seizure
of
philadelphia
by
the
british
september
the
invasion
of
new
york
by
burgoyne
and
his
capture
at
saratoga
in
october
and
the
encampment
of
american
forces
at
valley
forge
for
the
terrible
winter
of
the
final
phase
of
the
war
opening
with
the
treaty
of
alliance
with
france
on
february
was
confined
mainly
to
the
middle
states
the
west
and
the
south
in
the
first
sphere
of
action
the
chief
events
were
the
withdrawal
of
the
british
from
philadelphia
the
battle
of
monmouth
and
the
inclosure
of
the
british
in
new
york
by
deploying
american
forces
from
morristown
new
jersey
up
to
west
point
in
the
west
george

by
his

and
laid  firm
grip
on
the
country
between
the
ohio
and
the
great

in
the
south
the
second
period
opened
with
successes
for
the
british

captured

conquered

and
restored

in
they
seized

administered  crushing
defeat
to
the
american
forces
under

at
camden
and
overran
south
carolina
though
meeting
reverses
at
cowpens
and
king  mountain
then
came
the
closing
scenes
cornwallis
began
the
last
of
his
operations
he
pursued
general
greene
far
into
north
carolina
clashed
with
him
at
guilford
court
house
retired
to
the
coast
took
charge
of
british
forces
engaged
in
plundering
virginia
and
fortified
yorktown
where
he
was
penned
up
by
the
french
fleet
from
the
sea
and
the
combined
french
and
american
forces
on
land
the
geographical
aspects
of
the
war
for
the
british
the
theater
of
the
war
offered
many
problems
from
first
to
last
it
extended
from
massachusetts
to
georgia  distance
of
almost  thousand
miles
it
was
nearly
three
thousand
miles
from
the
main
base
of
supplies
and
though
the
british
navy
kept
the
channel
open
transports
were
constantly
falling
prey
to
daring
privateers
and
fleet
american
war
vessels
the
sea
on
the
other
hand
offered
an
easy
means
of
transportation
between
points
along
the
coast
and
gave
ready
access
to
the
american
centers
of
wealth
and
population
of
this
the
british
made
good
use
though
early
forced
to
give
up
boston
they
seized
new
york
and
kept
it
until
the
end
of
the
war
they
took
philadelphia
and
retained
it
until
threatened
by
the
approach
of
the
french
fleet
and
they
captured
and
held
both
savannah
and
charleston
wars
however
are
seldom
won
by
the
conquest
of
cities
particularly
was
this
true
in
the
case
of
the
revolution
only  small
portion
of
the
american
people
lived
in
towns
countrymen
back
from
the
coast
were
in
no
way
dependent
upon
them
for  livelihood
they
lived
on
the
produce
of
the
soil
not
upon
the
profits
of
trade
this
very
fact
gave
strength
to
them
in
the
contest
whenever
the
british
ventured
far
from
the
ports
of
entry
they
encountered
reverses
burgoyne
was
forced
to
surrender
at
saratoga
because
he
was
surrounded
and
cut
off
from
his
base
of
supplies
as
soon
as
the
british
got
away
from
charleston
they
were
harassed
and
worried
by
the
guerrilla
warriors
of
marion
sumter
and
pickens
cornwallis
could
technically
defeat
greene
at
guilford
far
in
the
interior
but
he
could
not
hold
the
inland
region
he
had
invaded
sustained
by
their
own
labor
possessing
the
interior
to
which
their
armies
could
readily
retreat
supplied
mainly
from
native
resources
the
americans
could
not
be
hemmed
in
penned
up
and
destroyed
at
one
fell
blow
the
sea
power
the
british
made
good
use
of
their
fleet
in
cutting
off
american
trade
but
control
of
the
sea
did
not
seriously
affect
the
united
states
as
an
agricultural
country
the
ruin
of
its
commerce
was
not
such  vital
matter
all
the
materials
for  comfortable
though
somewhat
rude
life
were
right
at
hand
it
made
little
difference
to  nation
fighting
for
existence
if
silks
fine
linens
and
chinaware
were
cut
off
this
was
an
evil
to
which
submission
was
necessary
nor
did
the
brilliant
exploits
of
john
paul
jones
and
captain
john
barry
materially
change
the
situation
they
demonstrated
the
skill
of
american
seamen
and
their
courage
as
fighting
men
they
raised
the
rates
of
british
marine
insurance
but
they
did
not
dethrone
the
mistress
of
the
seas
less
spectacular
and
more
distinctive
were
the
deeds
of
the
hundreds
of
privateers
and
minor
captains
who
overhauled
british
supply
ships
and
kept
british
merchantmen
in
constant
anxiety
not
until
the
french
fleet
was
thrown
into
the
scale
were
the
british
compelled
to
reckon
seriously
with
the
enemy
on
the
sea
and
make
plans
based
upon
the
possibilities
of  maritime
disaster
commanding
officers
on
the
score
of
military
leadership
it
is
difficult
to
compare
the
contending
forces
in
the
revolutionary
contest
there
is
no
doubt
that
all
the
british
commanders
were
men
of
experience
in
the
art
of
warfare
sir
william
howe
had
served
in
america
during
the
french
war
and
was
accounted
an
excellent
officer  strict
disciplinarian
and  gallant
gentleman
nevertheless
he
loved
ease
society
and
good
living
and
his
expulsion
from
boston
his
failure
to
overwhelm
washington
by
sallies
from
his
comfortable
bases
at
new
york
and
philadelphia
destroyed
every
shred
of
his
military
reputation
john
burgoyne
to
whom
was
given
the
task
of
penetrating
new
york
from
canada
had
likewise
seen
service
in
the
french
war
both
in
america
and
europe
he
had
however  touch
of
the
theatrical
in
his
nature
and
after
the
collapse
of
his
plans
and
the
surrender
of
his
army
in
he
devoted
his
time
mainly
to
light
literature
sir
henry
clinton
who
directed
the
movement
which
ended
in
the
capture
of
charleston
in
had
learned
his
trade
on
the
continent
and
was
regarded
as  man
of
discretion
and
understanding
in
military
matters
lord
cornwallis
whose
achievements
at
camden
and
guilford
were
blotted
out
by
his
surrender
at
yorktown
had
seen
service
in
the
seven
years
war
and
had
undoubted
talents
which
he
afterward
displayed
with
great
credit
to
himself
in
india
though
none
of
them
perhaps
were
men
of
first
rate
ability
they
all
had
training

experience
to
guide
them

george

and
had
tested
his
coolness
under

nearly
twenty
years
before
he

no

about

been
wounded
at

defeat
and
had

credit
during
the
seven

but
he
was
the
most
conspicuous
failure
of

the
triumph
over

was
the
work

from
the
standing
army
who
were
sent
over
at
the
opening
of
the
contest
the
recruits
drummed
up
by
special
efforts
at
home
and
the
thousands
of
hessians
bought
outright
by
king
george
presented
few
problems
of
management
to
the
british
officers
these
common
soldiers
were
far
away
from
home
and
enlisted
for
the
war
nearly
all
of
them
were
well
disciplined
and
many
of
them
experienced
in
actual
campaigns
the
armies
of
king
george
fought
bravely
as
the
records
of
bunker
hill
brandywine
and
monmouth
demonstrate
many  man
and
subordinate
officer
and
for
that
matter
some
of
the
high
officers
expressed  reluctance
at
fighting
against
their
own
kin
but
they
obeyed
orders
the
americans
on
the
other
hand
while
they
fought
with
grim
determination
as
men
fighting
for
their
homes
were
lacking
in
discipline
and
in
the
experience
of
regular
troops
when
the
war
broke
in
upon
them
there
were
no
common
preparations
for
it
there
was
no
continental
army
there
were
only
local
bands
of
militiamen
many
of
them
experienced
in
fighting
but
few
of
them
regulars
in
the
military
sense
moreover
they
were
volunteers
serving
for  short
time
unaccustomed
to
severe
discipline
and
impatient
at
the
restraints
imposed
on
them
by
long
and
arduous
campaigns
they
were
continually
leaving
the
service
just
at
the
most
critical
moments
the
militia
lamented
washington
come
in
you
cannot
tell
how
go
you
cannot
tell
where
consume
your
provisions
exhaust
your
stores
and
leave
you
at
last
at  critical
moment
again
and
again
washington
begged
congress
to
provide
for
an
army
of
regulars
enlisted
for
the
war
thoroughly
trained
and
paid
according
to
some
definite
plan
at
last
he
was
able
to
overcome
in
part
at
least
the
chronic
fear
of
civilians
in
congress
and
to
wring
from
that
reluctant
body
an
agreement
to
grant
half
pay
to
all
officers
and  bonus
to
all
privates
who
served
until
the
end
of
the
war
even
this
scheme
which
washington
regarded
as
far
short
of
justice
to
the
soldiers
did
not
produce
quick
results
it
was
near
the
close
of
the
conflict
before
he
had
an
army
of
well
disciplined
veterans
capable
of
meeting
british
regulars
on
equal
terms
though
there
were
times
when
militiamen
and
frontiersmen
did
valiant
and
effective
work
it
is
due
to
historical
accuracy
to
deny
the
time
honored
tradition
that  few
minutemen
overwhelmed
more
numerous
forces
of
regulars
in  seven
years
war
for
independence
they
did
nothing
of
the
sort
for
the
victories
of
bennington
trenton
saratoga
and
yorktown
there
were
the
defeats
of
bunker
hill
long
island
white
plains
germantown
and
camden
not
once
did
an
army
of
militiamen
overcome
an
equal
number
of
british
regulars
in
an
open
trial
by
battle
to
bring
men
to
be
well
acquainted
with
the
duties
of  soldier
wrote
washington
requires
time
to
expect
the
same
service
from
raw
and
undisciplined
recruits
as
from
veteran
soldiers
is
to
expect
what
never
did
and
perhaps
never
will
happen
how
the
war
was
won
then
how
did
the
american
army
win
the
war
for
one
thing
there
were
delays
and
blunders
on
the
part
of
the
british
generals
who
in
and
dallied
in
boston
and
new
york
with
large
bodies
of
regular
troops
when
they
might
have
been
dealing
paralyzing
blows
at
the
scattered
bands
that
constituted
the
american
army
nothing
but
the
supineness
or
folly
of
the
enemy
could
have
saved
us
solemnly
averred
washington
in
still
it
is
fair
to
say
that
this
apparent
supineness
was
not
all
due
to
the
british
generals
the
ministers
behind
them
believed
that  large
part
of
the
colonists
were
loyal
and
that
compromise
would
be
promoted
by
inaction
rather
than
by  war
vigorously
prosecuted
victory
by
masterly
inactivity
was
obviously
better
than
conquest
and
the
slighter
the
wounds
the
quicker
the
healing
later
in
the
conflict
when
the
seasoned
forces
of
france
were
thrown
into
the
scale
the
americans
themselves
had
learned
many
things
about
the
practical
conduct
of
campaigns
all
along
the
british
were
embarrassed
by
the
problem
of
supplies
their
troops
could
not
forage
with
the
skill
of
militiamen
as
they
were
in
unfamiliar
territory
the
long
oversea
voyages
were
uncertain
at
best
and
doubly
so
when
the
warships
of
france
joined
the
american
privateers
in
preying
on
supply
boats
the
british
were
in
fact
battered
and
worn
down
by  guerrilla
war
and
outdone
on
two
important
occasions
by
superior
forces
at
saratoga
and
yorktown
stern
facts
convinced
them
finally
that
an
immense
army
which
could
be
raised
only
by  supreme
effort
would
be
necessary
to
subdue
the
colonies
if
that
hazardous
enterprise
could
be
accomplished
at
all
they
learned
also
that
america
would
then
be
alienated
fretful
and
the
scene
of
endless
uprisings
calling
for
an
army
of
occupation
that
was  price
which
staggered
even
lord
north
and
george
iii
moreover
there
were
forces
of
opposition
at
home
with
which
they
had
to
reckon
women
and
the
war
at
no
time
were
the
women
of
america
indifferent
to
the
struggle
for
independence
when
it
was
confined
to
the
realm
of
opinion
they
did
their
part
in
creating
public
sentiment
mrs
elizabeth
timothee
for
example
founded
in
charleston
in  newspaper
to
espouse
the
cause
of
the
province
far
to
the
north
the
sister
of
james
otis
mrs
mercy
warren
early
begged
her
countrymen
to
rest
their
case
upon
their
natural
rights
and
in
influential
circles
she
urged
the
leaders
to
stand
fast
by
their
principles
while
john
adams
was
tossing
about
with
uncertainty
at
the
continental
congress
his
wife
was
writing
letters
to
him
declaring
her
faith
in
independency
when
the
war
came
down
upon
the
country
women
helped
in
every
field
in
sustaining
public
sentiment
they
were
active
mrs
warren
with  tireless
pen
combatted
loyalist
propaganda
in
many  drama
and
satire
almost
every
revolutionary
leader
had  wife
or
daughter
who
rendered
service
in
the
second
line
of
defense
mrs
washington
managed
the
plantation
while
the
general
was
at
the
front
and
went
north
to
face
the
rigors
of
the
awful
winter
at
valley
forge
an
inspiration
to
her
husband
and
his
men
the
daughter
of
benjamin
franklin
mrs
sarah
bache
while
her
father
was
pleading
the
american
cause
in
france
set
the
women
of
pennsylvania
to
work
sewing
and
collecting
supplies
even
near
the
firing
line
women
were
to
be
found
aiding
the
wounded
hauling
powder
to
the
front
and
carrying
dispatches
at
the
peril
of
their
lives
in
the
economic
sphere
the
work
of
women
was
invaluable
they
harvested
crops
without
enjoying
the
picturesque
title
of
farmerettes
and
they
canned
and
preserved
for
the
wounded
and
the
prisoners
of
war
of
their
labor
in
spinning
and
weaving
it
is
recorded
immediately
on
being
cut
off
from
the
use
of
english
manufactures
the
women
engaged
within
their
own
families
in
manufacturing
various
kinds
of
cloth
for
domestic
use
they
thus
kept
their
households
decently
clad
and
the
surplus
of
their
labors
they
sold
to
such
as
chose
to
buy
rather
than
make
for
themselves
in
this
way
the
female
part
of
families
by
their
industry
and
strict
economy
frequently
supported
the
whole
domestic
circle
evincing
the
strength
of
their
attachment
and
the
value
of
their
service
for
their
war
work
women
were
commended
by
high
authorities
on
more
than
one
occasion
they
were
given
medals
and
public
testimonials
even
as
in
our
own
day
washington
thanked
them
for
their
labors
and
paid
tribute
to
them
for
the
inspiration
and
material
aid
which
they
had
given
to
the
cause
of
independence
the
finances
of
the
revolution
when
the
revolution
opened
there
were
thirteen
little
treasuries
in
america
but
no
common
treasury
and
from
first
to
last
the
congress
was
in
the
position
of  beggar
rather
than  sovereign
having
no
authority
to
lay
and
collect
taxes
directly
and
knowing
the
hatred
of
the
provincials
for
taxation
it
resorted
mainly
to
loans
and
paper
money
to
finance
the
war
do
you
think
boldly
inquired
one
of
the
delegates
that  will
consent
to
load
my
constituents
with
taxes
when
we
can
send
to
the
printer
and
get  wagon
load
of
money
one
quire
of
which
will
pay
for
the
whole
paper
money
and
loans
acting
on
this
curious
but
appealing
political
economy
congress
issued
in
june
two
million
dollars
in
bills
of
credit
to
be
redeemed
by
the
states
on
the
basis
of
their
respective
populations
other
issues
followed
in
quick
succession
in
all
about
of
continental
paper
was
printed
to
which
the
several
states
added
nearly
of
their
own
notes
then
came
interest
bearing
bonds
in
ever
increasing
quantities
several
millions
were
also
borrowed
from
france
and
small
sums
from
holland
and
spain
in
desperation  national
lottery
was
held
producing
meager
results
the
property
of
tories
was
confiscated
and
sold
bringing
in
about
begging
letters
were
sent
to
the
states
asking
them
to
raise
revenues
for
the
continental
treasury
but
the
states
burdened
with
their
own
affairs
gave
little
heed
inflation
and
depreciation
as
paper
money
flowed
from
the
press
it
rapidly
declined
in
purchasing
power
until
in  dollar
was
worth
only
two
or
three
cents
in
gold
or
silver
attempts
were
made
by
congress
and
the
states
to
compel
people
to
accept
the
notes
at
face
value
but
these
were
like
attempts
to
make
water
flow
uphill
speculators
collected
at
once
to
fatten
on
the
calamities
of
the

fortunes
were
made

exclaimed
washington

too
many
melancholy
proofs
of
the
decay
of
public
virtue
nothing  am
convinced
but
the
depreciation
of
our
currency
aided
by
stock
jobbing
and
party
dissensions
has
fed
the
hopes
of

when

is
to
be

is
continuously
relieved
at  crisis

their
part
there
yet
remains
the
duty
of
recognizing
the
achievements
of
diplomacy
the
importance
of
this
field
of
activity
was
keenly
appreciated
by
the
leaders
in
the
continental
congress
they
were
fairly
well
versed
in
european
history
they
knew
of
the
balance
of
power
and
the
sympathies
interests
and
prejudices
of
nations
and
their
rulers
all
this
information
they
turned
to
good
account
in
opening
relations
with
continental
countries
and
seeking
money
supplies
and
even
military
assistance
for
the
transaction
of
this
delicate
business
they
created  secret

on

frederick

the
great

prepared
the
way
for

louis

before

brought
to
the
attention

the
opportunity
offered
by
the
outbreak
of

he
showed
him
how

these

had
already
urged
upon

before

appeared
on
the
scene
shortly
after
his
arrival
they
made
confidential
arrangements

with
fire
by
encouraging

however
this
was
more
serious
business
england
resented
the
presence
of

in

and
louis
had
to
be
cautious
about
plunging
into
another

the
fifteen
decisive
battles
of
the
world
reached
franklin
one
night
early
in
december
while
he
and
some
friends
sat
gloomily
at
dinner
beaumarchais
who
was
with
him
grasped
at
once
the
meaning
of
the
situation
and
set
off
to
the
court
at
versailles
with
such
haste
that
he
upset
his
coach
and
dislocated
his
arm
the
king
and
his
ministers
were
at
last
convinced
that
the
hour
had
come
to
aid
the
revolution
treaties
of
commerce
and
alliance
were
drawn
up
and
signed
in
february
the
independence
of
the
united
states
was
recognized
by
france
and
an
alliance
was
formed
to
guarantee
that
independence
combined
military
action
was
agreed
upon
and
louis
then
formally
declared
war
on
england
men
who
had  few
short
years
before
fought
one
another
in
the
wilderness
of
pennsylvania
or
on
the
plains
of
abraham
were
now
ranged
side
by
side
in  war
on
the
empire
that
pitt
had
erected
and
that
george
iii
was
pulling
down
spain
and
holland
involved
within  few
months
spain
remembering
the
steady
decline
of
her
sea
power
since
the
days
of
the
armada
and
hoping
to
drive
the
british
out
of
gibraltar
once
more
joined
the
concert
of
nations
against
england
holland  member
of  league
of
armed
neutrals
formed
in
protest
against
british
searches
on
the
high
seas
sent
her
fleet
to
unite
with
the
forces
of
spain
france
and
america
to
prey
upon
british
commerce
to
all
this
trouble
for
england
was
added
the
danger
of  possible
revolt
in
ireland
where
the
spirit
of
independence
was
flaming
up
the
british
offer
terms
to
america
seeing
the
colonists
about
to
be
joined
by
france
in  common
war
on
the
english
empire
lord
north
proposed
in
february  renewal
of
negotiations
by
solemn
enactment
parliament
declared
its
intention
not
to
exercise
the
right
of
imposing
taxes
within
the
colonies
at
the
same
time
it
authorized
the
opening
of
negotiations
through
commissioners
to
be
sent
to
america  truce
was
to
be
established
pardons
granted
objectionable
laws
suspended
and
the
old
imperial
constitution
as
it
stood
before
the
opening
of
hostilities
restored
to
full
vigor
it
was
too
late
events
had
taken
the
affairs
of
america
out
of
the
hands
of
british
commissioners
and
diplomats
effects
of
french
aid
the
french
alliance
brought
ships
of
war
large
sums
of
gold
and
silver
loads
of
supplies
and  considerable
body
of
trained
soldiers
to
the
aid
of
the
americans
timely
as
was
this
help
it
meant
no
sudden
change
in
the
fortunes
of
war
the
british
evacuated
philadelphia
in
the
summer
following
the
alliance
and
washington  troops
were
encouraged
to
come
out
of
valley
forge
they
inflicted  heavy
blow
on
the
british
at
monmouth
but
the
treasonable
conduct
of
general
charles
lee
prevented  triumph
the
recovery
of
philadelphia
was
offset
by
the
treason
of
benedict
arnold
the
loss
of
savannah
and
charleston
and
the
defeat
of
gates
at
camden
the
full
effect
of
the
french
alliance
was
not
felt
until
when
cornwallis
went
into
virginia
and
settled
at
yorktown
accompanied
by
french
troops
washington
swept
rapidly
southward
and
penned
the
british
to
the
shore
while  powerful
french
fleet
shut
off
their
escape
by
sea
it
was
this
movement
which
certainly
could
not
have
been
executed
without
french
aid
that
put
an
end
to
all
chance
of
restoring
british
dominion
in
america
it
was
the
surrender
of
cornwallis
at
yorktown
that
caused
lord
north
to
pace
the
floor
and
cry
out
it
is
all
over
it
is
all
over
what
might
have
been
done
without
the
french
alliance
lies
hidden
from
mankind
what
was
accomplished
with
the
help
of
french
soldiers
sailors
officers
money
and
supplies
is
known
to
all
the
earth
all
the
world
agree
exultantly
wrote
franklin
from
paris
to
general
washington
that
no
expedition
was
ever
better
planned
or
better
executed
it
brightens
the
glory
that
must
accompany
your
name
to
the
latest
posterity
diplomacy
as
well
as
martial
valor
had
its
reward
peace
at
last
british
opposition
to
the
war
in
measuring
the
forces
that
led
to
the
final
discomfiture
of
king
george
and
lord
north
it
is
necessary
to
remember
that
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
the
british
ministry
at
home
faced  powerful
informed
and
relentless
opposition
there
were
vigorous
protests
first
against
the
obnoxious
acts
which
precipitated
the
unhappy
quarrel
then
against
the
way
in
which
the
war
was
waged
and
finally
against
the
futile
struggle
to
retain  hold
upon
the
american
dominions
among
the
members
of
parliament
who
thundered
against
the
government
were
the
first
statesmen
and
orators
of
the
land
william
pitt
earl
of
chatham
though
he
deplored
the
idea
of
american
independence
denounced
the
government
as
the
aggressor
and
rejoiced
in
american
resistance
edmund
burke
leveled
his
heavy
batteries
against
every
measure
of
coercion
and
at
last
strove
for  peace
which
while
giving
independence
to
america
would
work
for
reconciliation
rather
than
estrangement
charles
james
fox
gave
the
colonies
his
generous
sympathy
and
warmly
championed
their
rights
outside
of
the
circle
of
statesmen
there
were
stout
friends
of
the
american
cause
like
david
hume
the
philosopher
and
historian
and
catherine
macaulay
an
author
of
wide
fame
and  republican
bold
enough
to
encourage
washington
in
seeing
it
through
against
this
powerful
opposition
the
government
enlisted  whole
army
of
scribes
and
journalists
to
pour
out
criticism
on
the
americans
and
their
friends
dr
samuel
johnson
whom
it
employed
in
this
business
was
so
savage
that
even
the
ministers
had
to
tone
down
his
pamphlets
before
printing
them
far
more
weighty
was
edward
gibbon
who
was
in
time
to
win
fame
as
the
historian
of
the
decline
and
fall
of
the
roman
empire
he
had
at
first
opposed
the
government
but
on
being
given  lucrative
post
he
used
his
sharp
pen
in
its
support
causing
his
friends
to
ridicule
him
in
these
lines
king
george
in  fright
lest
gibbon
should
write
the
story
of
england  disgrace
thought
no
way
so
sure
his
pen
to
secure
as
to
give
the
historian  place
lord
north
yields
as
time
wore
on
events
bore
heavily
on
the
side
of
the
opponents
of
the
government  measures
they
had
predicted
that
conquest
was
impossible
and
they
had
urged
the
advantages
of  peace
which
would
in
some
measure
restore
the
affections
of
the
americans
every
day  news
confirmed
their
predictions
and
lent
support
to
their
arguments
moreover
the
war
which
sprang
out
of
an
effort
to
relieve
english
burdens
made
those
burdens
heavier
than
ever
military
expenses
were
daily
increasing
trade
with
the
colonies
the
greatest
single
outlet
for
british
goods
and
capital
was
paralyzed
the
heavy
debts
due
british
merchants
in
america
were
not
only
unpaid
but
postponed
into
an
indefinite
future
ireland
was
on
the
verge
of
revolution
the
french
had  dangerous
fleet
on
the
high
seas
in
vain
did
the
king
assert
in
december
that
no
difficulties
would
ever
make
him
consent
to  peace
that
meant
american
independence
parliament
knew
better
and
on
february
in
the
house
of
commons
was
carried
an
address
to
the
throne
against
continuing
the
war
burke
fox
the
younger
pitt
barre
and
other
friends
of
the
colonies
voted
in
the
affirmative
lord
north
gave
notice
then
that
his
ministry
was
at
an
end
the
king
moaned
necessity
made
me
yield
in
april
franklin
received
word
from
the
english
government
that
it
was
prepared
to
enter
into
negotiations
leading
to  settlement
this
was
embarrassing
in
the
treaty
of
alliance
with
france
the
united
states
had
promised
that
peace
should
be  joint
affair
agreed
to
by
both
nations
in
open
conference
finding
france
however
opposed
to
some
of
their
claims
respecting
boundaries
and
fisheries
the
american
commissioners
conferred
with
the
british
agents
at
paris
without
consulting
the
french
minister
they
actually
signed  preliminary
peace
draft
before
they
informed
him
of
their
operations
when
vergennes
reproached
him
franklin
replied
that
they
had
been
guilty
of
neglecting
bienseance
good
manners
but
hoped
that
the
great
work
would
not
be
ruined
by  single
indiscretion
the
terms
of
peace
the
general
settlement
at
paris
in
was  triumph
for
america
england
recognized
the
independence
of
the
united
states
naming
each
state
specifically
and
agreed
to
boundaries
extending
from
the
atlantic
to
the
mississippi
and
from
the
great
lakes
to
the
floridas
england
held
canada
newfoundland
and
the
west
indies
intact
made
gains
in
india
and
maintained
her
supremacy
on
the
seas
spain
won
florida
and
minorca
but
not
the
coveted
gibraltar
france
gained
nothing
important
save
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
england
humbled
and
the
colonies
independent
the
generous
terms
secured
by
the
american
commission
at
paris
called
forth
surprise
and
gratitude
in
the
united
states
and
smoothed
the
way
for  renewal
of
commercial
relations
with
the
mother
country
at
the
same
time
they
gave
genuine
anxiety
to
european
diplomats
this
federal
republic
is
born  pigmy
wrote
the
spanish
ambassador
to
his
royal
master  day
will
come
when
it
will
be  giant
even  colossus
formidable
to
these
countries
liberty
of
conscience
and
the
facility
for
establishing  new
population
on
immense
lands
as
well
as
the
advantages
of
the
new
government
will
draw
thither
farmers
and
artisans
from
all
the
nations
in  few
years
we
shall
watch
with
grief
the
tyrannical
existence
of
the
same
colossus
illustration
north
america
according
to
the
treaty
of
summary
of
the
revolutionary
period
the
independence
of
the
american
colonies
was
foreseen
by
many
european
statesmen
as
they
watched
the
growth
of
their
population
wealth
and
power
but
no
one
could
fix
the
hour
of
the
great
event
until
the
american
colonists
lived
fairly
happily
under
british
dominion
there
were
collisions
from
time
to
time
of
course
royal
governors
clashed
with
stiff
necked
colonial
legislatures
there
were
protests
against
the
exercise
of
the
king  veto
power
in
specific
cases
nevertheless
on
the
whole
the
relations
between
america
and
the
mother
country
were
more
amicable
in
than
at
any
period
under
the
stuart
regime
which
closed
in
the
crash
when
it
came
was
not
deliberately
willed
by
any
one
it
was
the
product
of  number
of
forces
that
happened
to
converge
about
three
years
before
there
had
come
to
the
throne
george
iii  young
proud
inexperienced
and
stubborn
king
for
nearly
fifty
years
his
predecessors
germans
as
they
were
in
language
and
interest
had
allowed
things
to
drift
in
england
and
america
george
iii
decided
that
he
would
be
king
in
fact
as
well
as
in
name
about
the
same
time
england
brought
to  close
the
long
and
costly
french
and
indian
war
and
was
staggering
under  heavy
burden
of
debt
and
taxes
the
war
had
been
fought
partly
in
defense
of
the
american
colonies
and
nothing
seemed
more
reasonable
to
english
statesmen
than
the
idea
that
the
colonies
should
bear
part
of
the
cost
of
their
own
defense
at
this
juncture
there
came
into
prominence
in
royal
councils
two
men
bent
on
taxing
america
and
controlling
her
trade
grenville
and
townshend
the
king
was
willing
the
english
taxpayers
were
thankful
for
any
promise
of
relief
and
statesmen
were
found
to
undertake
the
experiment
england
therefore
set
out
upon  new
course
she
imposed
taxes
upon
the
colonists
regulated
their
trade
and
set
royal
officers
upon
them
to
enforce
the
law
this
action
evoked
protests
from
the
colonists
they
held  stamp
act
congress
to
declare
their
rights
and
petition
for  redress
of
grievances
some
of
the
more
restless
spirits
rioted
in
the
streets
sacked
the
houses
of
the
king  officers
and
tore
up
the
stamped
paper
frightened
by
uprising
the
english
government
drew
back
and
repealed
the
stamp
act
then
it
veered
again
and
renewed
its
policy
of
interference
interference
again
called
forth
american
protests
protests
aroused
sharper
retaliation
more
british
regulars
were
sent
over
to
keep
order
more
irritating
laws
were
passed
by
parliament
rioting
again
appeared
tea
was
dumped
in
the
harbor
of
boston
and
seized
in
the
harbor
of
charleston
the
british
answer
was
more
force
the
response
of
the
colonists
was  continental
congress
for
defense
an
unexpected
and
unintended
clash
of
arms
at
lexington
and
concord
in
the
spring
of
brought
forth
from
the

of

three
years
later

even
if
splendidly
phrased
and
paper
constitutions
drawn
by
finest
enthusiasm
uninstructed
by
experience
could
not
alone
make
the
republic
great
and
prosperous
or
even
free
all
around
them
they
saw
chaos
in
finance
and
in
industry
and
perils
for
the
immediate
future
the
weakness
of
the
articles
of
confederation
the
government
under
the
articles
of
confederation
had
neither
the
strength
nor
the
resources
necessary
to
cope
with
the
problems
of
reconstruction
left
by
the
war
the
sole
organ
of
government
was  congress
composed
of
from
two
to
seven
members
from
each
state
chosen
as
the
legislature
might
direct
and
paid
by
the
state
in
determining
all
questions
each
state
had
one
vote
delaware
thus
enjoying
the
same
weight
as
virginia
there
was
no
president
to
enforce
the
laws
congress
was
given
power
to
select  committee
of
thirteen
one
from
each
state
to
act
as
an
executive
body
when
it
was
not
in
session
but
this
device
on
being
tried
out
proved  failure
there
was
no
system
of
national
courts
to
which
citizens
and
states
could
appeal
for
the
protection
of
their
rights
or
through
which
they
could
compel
obedience
to
law
the
two
great
powers
of
government
military
and
financial
were
withheld
congress
it
is
true
could
authorize
expenditures
but
had
to
rely
upon
the
states
for
the
payment
of
contributions
to
meet
its
bills
it
could
also
order
the
establishment
of
an
army
but
it
could
only
request
the
states
to
supply
their
respective
quotas
of
soldiers
it
could
not
lay
taxes
nor
bring
any
pressure
to
bear
upon  single
citizen
in
the
whole
country
it
could
act
only
through
the
medium
of
the
state
governments
financial
and
commercial
disorders
in
the
field
of
public
finance
the
disorders
were
pronounced
the
huge
debt
incurred
during
the
war
was
still
outstanding
congress
was
unable
to
pay
either
the
interest
or
the
principal
public
creditors
were
in
despair
as
the
market
value
of
their
bonds
sank
to
twenty
five
or
even
ten
cents
on
the
dollar
the
current
bills
of
congress
were
unpaid
as
some
one
complained
there
was
not
enough
money
in
the
treasury
to
buy
pen
and
ink
with
which
to
record
the
transactions
of
the
shadow
legislature
the
currency
was
in
utter
chaos
millions
of
dollars
in
notes
issued
by
congress
had
become
mere
trash
worth  cent
or
two
on
the
dollar
there
was
no
other
expression
of
contempt
so
forceful
as
the
popular
saying
not
worth  continental
to
make
matters
worse
several
of
the
states
were
pouring
new
streams
of
paper
money
from
the
press
almost
the
only
good
money
in
circulation
consisted
of
english
french
and
spanish
coins
and
the
public
was
even
defrauded
by
them
because
money
changers
were
busy
clipping
and
filing
away
the
metal
foreign
commerce
was
unsettled
the
entire
british
system
of
trade
discrimination
was
turned
against
the
americans
and
congress
having
no
power
to
regulate
foreign
commerce
was
unable
to
retaliate
or
to
negotiate
treaties
which
it
could
enforce
domestic
commerce
was
impeded
by
the
jealousies
of
the
states
which
erected
tariff
barriers
against
their
neighbors
the
condition
of
the
currency
made
the
exchange
of
money
and
goods
extremely
difficult
and
as
if
to
increase
the
confusion
backward
states
enacted
laws
hindering
the
prompt
collection
of
debts
within
their
borders
an
evil
which
nothing
but  national
system
of
courts
could
cure
congress
in
disrepute
with
treaties
set
at
naught
by
the
states
the
laws
unenforced
the
treasury
empty
and
the
public
credit
gone
the
congress
of
the
united
states
fell
into
utter
disrepute
it
called
upon
the
states
to
pay
their
quotas
of
money
into
the
treasury
only
to
be
treated
with
contempt
even
its
own
members
looked
upon
it
as  solemn
futility
some
of
the
ablest
men
refused
to
accept
election
to
it
and
many
who
did
take
the
doubtful
honor
failed
to
attend
the
sessions
again
and
again
it
was
impossible
to
secure  quorum
for
the
transaction
of
business
troubles
of
the
state
governments
the
state
governments
free
to
pursue
their
own
course
with
no
interference
from
without
had
almost
as
many
difficulties
as
the
congress
they
too
were
loaded
with
revolutionary
debts
calling
for
heavy
taxes
upon
an
already
restive
population
oppressed
by
their
financial
burdens
and
discouraged
by
the
fall
in
prices
which
followed
the
return
of
peace
the
farmers
of
several
states
joined
in  concerted
effort
and
compelled
their
legislatures
to
issue
large
sums
of
paper
money
the
currency
fell
in
value
but
nevertheless
it
was
forced
on
unwilling
creditors
to
square
old
accounts
in
every
part
of
the
country
legislative
action
fluctuated
violently
laws
were
made
one
year
only
to
be
repealed
the
next
and
reenacted
the
third
year
lands
were
sold
by
one
legislature
and
the
sales
were
canceled
by
its
successor
uncertainty
and
distrust
were
the
natural
consequences
men
of
substance
longed
for
some
power
that
would
forbid
states
to
issue
bills
of
credit
to
make
paper
money
legal
tender
in
payment
of
debts
or
to
impair
the
obligation
of
contracts
men
heavily
in
debt
on
the
other
hand
urged
even
more
drastic
action
against
creditors
so
great
did
the
discontent
of
the
farmers
in
new
hampshire
become
in
that  mob
surrounded
the
legislature
demanding  repeal
of
the
taxes
and
the
issuance
of
paper
money
it
was
with
difficulty
that
an
armed
rebellion
was
avoided
in
massachusetts
the
malcontents
under
the
leadership
of
daniel
shays  captain
in
the
revolutionary
army
organized
that
same
year
open
resistance
to
the
government
of
the
state
shays
and
his
followers
protested
against
the
conduct
of
creditors
in
foreclosing
mortgages
upon
the
debt
burdened
farmers
against
the
lawyers
for
increasing
the
costs
of
legal
proceedings
against
the
senate
of
the
state
the
members
of
which
were
apportioned
among
the
towns
on
the
basis
of
the
amount
of
taxes
paid
against
heavy
taxes
and
against
the
refusal
of
the
legislature
to
issue
paper
money
they
seized
the
towns
of
worcester
and
springfield
and
broke
up
the
courts
of
justice
all
through
the
western
part
of
the
state
the
revolt
spread
sending  shock
of
alarm
to
every
center
and
section
of
the
young
republic
only
by
the
most
vigorous
action
was
governor
bowdoin
able
to
quell
the
uprising
and
when
that
task
was
accomplished
the
state
government
did
not
dare
to
execute
any
of
the
prisoners
because
they
had
so
many
sympathizers
moreover
bowdoin
and
several
members
of
the
legislature
who
had
been
most
zealous
in
their
attacks
on
the
insurgents
were
defeated
at
the
ensuing
election
the
need
of
national
assistance
for
state
governments
in
times
of
domestic
violence
was
everywhere
emphasized
by
men
who
were
opposed
to
revolutionary
acts
alarm
over
dangers
to
the
republic
leading
american
citizens
watching
the
drift
of
affairs
were
slowly
driven
to
the
conclusion
that
the
new
ship
of
state
so
proudly
launched  few
years
before
was
careening
into
anarchy
the
facts
of
our
peace
and
independence
wrote  friend
of
washington
do
not
at
present
wear
so
promising
an
appearance
as  had
fondly
painted
in
my
mind
the
prejudices
jealousies
and
turbulence
of
the
people
at
times
almost
stagger
my
confidence
in
our
political
establishments
and
almost
occasion
me
to
think
that
they
will
show
themselves
unworthy
of
the
noble
prize
for
which
we
have
contended
washington
himself
was
profoundly
discouraged
on
hearing
of
shays  rebellion
he
exclaimed
what
gracious
god
is
man
that
there
should
be
such
inconsistency
and
perfidiousness
in
his
conduct
it
is
but
the
other
day
that
we
were
shedding
our
blood
to
obtain
the
constitutions
under
which
we
now
live
constitutions
of
our
own
choice
and
making
and
now
we
are
unsheathing
our
sword
to
overturn
them
the
same
year
he
burst
out
in  lament
over
rumors
of
restoring
royal
government  am
told
that
even
respectable
characters
speak
of  monarchical
government
without
horror
from
thinking
proceeds
speaking
hence
to
acting
is
often
but  single
step
but
how
irresistible
and
tremendous
what  triumph
for
our
enemies
to
verify
their
predictions
what  triumph
for
the
advocates
of
despotism
to
find
that
we
are
incapable
of
governing
ourselves
congress
attempts
some
reforms
the
congress
was
not
indifferent
to
the
events
that
disturbed
washington
on
the
contrary
it
put
forth
many
efforts
to
check
tendencies
so
dangerous
to
finance
commerce
industries
and
the
confederation
itself
in
even
before
the
treaty
of
peace
was
signed
the
congress
having
found
out
how
futile
were
its
taxing
powers
carried  resolution
of
amendment
to
the
articles
of
confederation
authorizing
the
levy
of  moderate
duty
on
imports
yet
this
mild
measure
was
rejected
by
the
states
two
years
later
the
congress
prepared
another
amendment
sanctioning
the
levy
of
duties
on
imports
to
be
collected
this
time
by
state
officers
and
applied
to
the
payment
of
the
public
debt
this
more
limited
proposal
designed
to
save
public
credit
likewise
failed
in
the
congress
made  third
appeal
to
the
states
for
help
declaring
that
they
had
been
so
irregular
and
so
negligent
in
paying
their
quotas
that
further
reliance
upon
that
mode
of
raising
revenues
was
dishonorable
and
dangerous
the
calling
of  constitutional
convention
hamilton
and
washington
urge
reform
the
attempts
at
reform
by
the
congress
were
accompanied
by
demand
for
both
within
and
without
that
body  convention
to
frame  new
plan
of
government
in
the
youthful
alexander
hamilton
realizing
the
weakness
of
the
articles
so
widely
discussed
proposed  general
convention
for
the
purpose
of
drafting  new
constitution
on
entirely
different
principles
with
tireless
energy
he
strove
to
bring
his
countrymen
to
his
view
washington
agreeing
with
him
on
every
point
declared
in  circular
letter
to
the
governors
that
the
duration
of
the
union
would
be
short
unless
there
was
lodged
somewhere  supreme
power
to
regulate
and
govern
the
general
concerns
of
the
confederated
republic
the
governor
of
massachusetts
disturbed
by
the
growth
of
discontent
all
about
him
suggested
to
the
state
legislature
in
the
advisability
of  national
convention
to
enlarge
the
powers
of
the
congress
the
legislature
approved
the
plan
but
did
not
press
it
to  conclusion

alexander
hamilton
the
annapolis
convention
action
finally
came
from
the
south
the
virginia
legislature
taking
things
into
its
own
hands
called  conference
of
delegates
at
annapolis
to
consider
matters
of
taxation
and
commerce
when
the
convention
assembled
in
it
was
found
that
only
five
states
had
taken
the
trouble
to
send
representatives
the
leaders
were
deeply
discouraged
but
the
resourceful
hamilton  delegate
from
new
york
turned
the
affair
to
good
account
he
secured
the
adoption
of  resolution
calling
upon
the
congress
itself
to
summon
another
convention
to
meet
at
philadelphia  national
convention
called
the
congress
as
tardy
as
ever
at
last
decided
in
february
to
issue
the
call
fearing
drastic
changes
however
it
restricted
the
convention
to
the
sole
and
express
purpose
of
revising
the
articles
of
confederation
jealous
of
its
own
powers
it
added
that
any
alterations
proposed
should
be
referred
to
the
congress
and
the
states
for
their
approval
every
state
in
the
union
except
rhode
island
responded
to
this
call
indeed
some
of
the
states
having
the
annapolis
resolution
before
them
had
already
anticipated
the
congress
by
selecting
delegates
before
the
formal
summons
came
thus
by
the
persistence
of
governors

and
private
citizens
there
was
brought
about

in  marked
manner

great
problems
before

were
nine
in
number
shall
the

system
of

constructed
shall
the

be

on

in

as
under

articles
or
on
the
broader
and
deeper
foundation
of

what
direct
share
shall
the
people
have
in
the
election
of
national
officers
what
shall
be
the
qualifications
for
the

how
shall
the
conflicting
interests
of
the
commercial
and
the
planting
states
be
balanced
so
as
to
safeguard
the
essential
rights
of

what
shall
be
the
form
of
the
new

what
powers
shall
be
conferred
on
it
how
shall
the
state
legislatures
be
restrained
from
their
attacks
on
property
rights
such
as
the
issuance
of
paper
money
shall
the
approval
of
all
the
states
be
necessary
as
under
the
articles
for
the
adoption
and
amendment
of
the
constitution
revision
of
the
articles
or  new
government
the
moment
the
first
problem
was
raised
representatives
of
the
small
states
led
by
william
paterson
of
new
jersey
were
on
their
feet
they
feared
that
if
the
articles
were
overthrown
the
equality
and
rights
of
the
states
would
be
put
in
jeopardy
their
protest
was
therefore
vigorous
they
cited
the
call
issued
by
the
congress
in
summoning
the
convention
which
specifically
stated
that
they
were
assembled
for
the
sole
and
express
purpose
of
revising
the
articles
of
confederation
they
cited
also
their
instructions
from
their
state
legislatures
which
authorized
them
to
revise
and
amend
the
existing
scheme
of
government
not
to
make  revolution
in
it
to
depart
from
the
authorization
laid
down
by
the
congress
and
the
legislatures
would
be
to
exceed
their
powers
they
argued
and
to
betray
the
trust
reposed
in
them
by
their
countrymen
to
their
contentions
randolph
of
virginia
replied
when
the
salvation
of
the
republic
is
at
stake
it
would
be
treason
to
our
trust
not
to
propose
what
we
find
necessary
hamilton
reminding
the
delegates
that
their
work
was
still
subject
to
the
approval
of
the
states
frankly
said
that
on
the
point
of
their
powers
he
had
no
scruples
with
the
issue
clear
the
convention
cast
aside
the
articles
as
if
they
did
not
exist
and
proceeded
to
the
work
of
drawing
up  new
constitution
laying
its
foundations
on
such
principles
and
organizing
its
powers
in
such
form
as
to
the
delegates
seemed
most
likely
to
affect
their
safety
and
happiness  government
founded
on
states
or
on
people
the
compromise
defeated
in
their
attempt
to
limit
the
convention
to  mere
revision
of
the
articles
the
spokesmen
of
the
smaller
states
redoubled
their
efforts
to
preserve
the
equality
of
the
states
the
signal
for  radical
departure
from
the
articles
on
this
point
was
given
early
in
the
sessions
when
randolph
presented
the
virginia
plan
he
proposed
that
the
new
national
legislature
consist
of
two
houses
the
members
of
which
were
to
be
apportioned
among
the
states
according
to
their
wealth
or
free
white
population
as
the
convention
might
decide
this
plan
was
vehemently
challenged
paterson
of
new
jersey
flatly
avowed
that
neither
he
nor
his
state
would
ever
bow
to
such
tyranny
as
an
alternative
he
presented
the
new
jersey
plan
calling
for  national
legislature
of
one
house
representing
states
as
such
not
wealth
or
people  legislature
in
which
all
states
large
or
small
would
have
equal
voice
wilson
of
pennsylvania
on
behalf
of
the
more
populous
states
took
up
the
gauntlet
which
paterson
had
thrown
down
it
was
absurd
he
urged
for
men
in
one
state
to
have
the
same
weight
in
national
counsels
as
men
in
another
state
the
gentleman
from
new
jersey
he
said
is
candid
he
declares
his
opinion
boldly  will
be
equally
candid  will
never
confederate
on
his
principles
so
the
bitter
controversy
ran
on
through
many
exciting
sessions
greek
had
met
greek
the
convention
was
hopelessly
deadlocked
and
on
the
verge
of
dissolution
scarce
held
together
by
the
strength
of  hair
as
one
of
the
delegates
remarked  crash
was
averted
only
by  compromise
instead
of  congress
of
one
house
as
provided
by
the
articles
the
convention
agreed
upon  legislature
of
two
houses
in
the
senate
the
aspirations
of
the
small
states
were
to
be
satisfied
for
each
state
was
given
two
members
in
that
body
in
the
formation
of
the
house
of
representatives
the
larger
states
were
placated
for
it
was
agreed
that
the
members
of
that
chamber
were
to
be
apportioned
among
the
states
on
the
basis
of
population
counting
three
fifths
of
the
slaves
the
question
of
popular
election
the
method
of
selecting
federal
officers
and
members
of
congress
also
produced
an
acrimonious
debate
which
revealed
how
deep
seated
was
the
distrust
of
the
capacity
of
the
people
to
govern
themselves
few
there
were
who
believed
that
no
branch
of
the
government
should
be
elected
directly
by
the
voters
still
fewer
were
there
however
who
desired
to
see
all
branches
so
chosen
one
or
two
even
expressed  desire
for  monarchy
the
dangers
of
democracy
were
stressed
by
gerry
of
massachusetts
all
the
evils
we
experience
flow
from
an
excess
of
democracy
the
people
do
not
want
virtue
but
are
the
dupes
of
pretended
patriots  have
been
too
republican
heretofore
but
have
been
taught
by
experience
the
danger
of  leveling
spirit
to
the
democratic
licentiousness
of
the
state
legislatures
randolph
sought
to
oppose  firm
senate
to
check
the
excesses
of
popular
government
charles
pinckney
of
south
carolina
declared
that
no
one
should
be
elected
president
who
was
not
worth
and
that
high
property
qualifications
should
be
placed
on
members
of
congress
and
judges
other
members
of
the
convention
were
stoutly
opposed
to
such
high
toned
notions
of
government
franklin
and
wilson
both
from
pennsylvania
vigorously
championed
popular
election
while
men
like
madison
insisted
that
at
least
one
part
of
the
government
should
rest
on
the
broad
foundation
of
the
people
out
of
this
clash
of
opinion
also
came
compromise
one
branch
the
house
of
representatives
it
was
agreed
was
to
be
elected
directly
by
the
voters
while
the
senators
were
to
be
elected
indirectly
by
the
state
legislatures
the
president
was
to
be
chosen
by
electors
selected
as
the
legislatures
of
the
states
might
determine
and
the
judges
of
the
federal
courts
supreme
and
inferior
by
the
president
and
the
senate
the
question
of
the
suffrage
the
battle
over
the
suffrage
was
sharp
but
brief
gouverneur
morris
proposed
that
only
land
owners
should
be
permitted
to
vote
madison
replied
that
the
state
legislatures
which
had
made
so
much
trouble
with
radical
laws
were
elected
by
freeholders
after
the
debate
the
delegates
unable
to
agree
on
any
property
limitations
on
the
suffrage
decided
that
the
house
of
representatives
should
be
elected
by
voters
having
the
qualifications
requisite
for
electors
of
the
most
numerous
branch
of
the
state
legislature
thus
they
accepted
the
suffrage
provisions
of
the
states
the
balance
between
the
planting
and
the
commercial
states
after
the
debates
had
gone
on
for  few
weeks
madison
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
real
division
in
the
convention
was
not
between
the
large
and
the
small
states
but
between
the
planting
section
founded
on
slave
labor
and
the
commercial
north
thus
he
anticipated
by
nearly
three
quarters
of  century
the
irrepressible
conflict
the
planting
states
had
neither
the
free
white
population
nor
the
wealth
of
the
north
there
were
counting
delaware
six
of
them
as
against
seven
commercial
states
dependent
for
their
prosperity
mainly
upon
the
sale
of
tobacco
rice
and
other
staples
abroad
they
feared
that
congress
might
impose
restraints
upon
their
enterprise
being
weaker
in
numbers
they
were
afraid
that
the
majority
might
lay
an
unfair
burden
of
taxes
upon
them
representation
and
taxation
the
southern
members
of
the
convention
were
therefore
very
anxious
to
secure
for
their
section
the
largest
possible
representation
in
congress
and
at
the
same
time
to
restrain
the
taxing
power
of
that
body
two
devices
were
thought
adapted
to
these
ends
one
was
to
count
the
slaves
as
people
when
apportioning
representatives
among
the
states
according
to
their
respective
populations
the
other
was
to
provide
that
direct
taxes
should
be
apportioned
among
the
states
in
proportion
not
to
their
wealth
but
to
the
number
of
their
free
white
inhabitants
for
obvious
reasons
the
northern
delegates
objected
to
these
proposals
once
more  compromise
proved
to
be
the
solution
it
was
agreed
that
not
all
the
slaves
but
three
fifths
of
them
should
be
counted
for
both
purposes
representation
and
direct
taxation
commerce
and
the
slave
trade
southern
interests
were
also
involved
in
the
project
to
confer
upon
congress
the
power
to
regulate
interstate
and
foreign
commerce
to
the
manufacturing
and
trading
states
this
was
essential
it
would
prevent
interstate
tariffs
and
trade
jealousies
it
would
enable
congress
to
protect
american
manufactures
and
to
break
down
by
appropriate
retaliations
foreign
discriminations
against
american
commerce
to
the
south
the
proposal
was
menacing
because
tariffs
might
interfere
with
the
free
exchange
of
the
produce
of
plantations
in
european
markets
and
navigation
acts
might
confine
the
carrying
trade
to
american
that
is
northern
ships
the
importation
of
slaves
moreover
it
was
feared
might
be
heavily
taxed
or
immediately
prohibited
altogether
the
result
of
this
and
related
controversies
was  debate
on
the
merits
of
slavery
gouverneur
morris
delivered
his
mind
and
heart
on
that
subject
denouncing
slavery
as  nefarious
institution
and
the
curse
of
heaven
on
the
states
in
which
it
prevailed
mason
of
virginia  slaveholder
himself
was
hardly
less
outspoken
saying
slavery
discourages
arts
and
manufactures
the
poor
despise
labor
when
performed
by
slaves
they
prevent
the
migration
of
whites
who
really
strengthen
and
enrich  country
the
system
however
had
its
defenders
representatives
from
south
carolina
argued
that
their
entire
economic
life
rested
on
slave
labor
and
that
the
high
death
rate
in
the
rice
swamps
made
continuous
importation
necessary
ellsworth
of
connecticut
took
the
ground
that
the
convention
should
not
meddle
with
slavery
the
morality
or
wisdom
of
slavery
he
said
are
considerations
belonging
to
the
states
what
enriches  part
enriches
the
whole
to
the
future
he
turned
an
untroubled
face
as
population
increases
poor
laborers
will
be
so
plenty
as
to
render
slaves
useless
slavery
in
time
will
not
be  speck
in
our
country
virginia
and
north
carolina
already
overstocked
with
slaves
favored
prohibiting
the
traffic
in
them
but
south
carolina
was
adamant
she
must
have
fresh
supplies
of
slaves
or
she
would
not
federate
so
it
was
agreed
that
while
congress
might
regulate
foreign
trade
by
majority
vote
the
importation
of
slaves
should
not
be
forbidden
before
the
lapse
of
twenty
years
and
that
any
import
tax
should
not
exceed  head
at
the
same
time
in
connection
with
the
regulation
of
foreign
trade
it
was
stipulated
that  two
thirds
vote
in
the
senate
should
be
necessary
in
the
ratification
of
treaties  further
concession
to
the
south
was
made
in
the
provision
for
the
return
of
runaway
slaves  provision
also
useful
in
the
north
where
indentured
servants
were
about
as
troublesome
as
slaves
in
escaping
from
their
masters
the
form
of
the
government
as
to
the
details
of
the
frame
of
government
and
the
grand
principles
involved
the
opinion
of
the
convention
ebbed
and
flowed
decisions
being
taken
in
the
heat
of
debate
only
to
be
revoked
and
taken
again
the
executive
there
was
general
agreement
that
there
should
be
an
executive
branch
for
reliance
upon
congress
to
enforce
its
own
laws
and
treaties
had
been  broken
reed
on
the
character
and
functions
of
the
executive
however
there
were
many
views
the
new
jersey
plan
called
for  council
selected
by
the
congress
the
virginia
plan
provided
that
the
executive
branch
should
be
chosen
by
the
congress
but
did
not
state
whether
it
should
be
composed
of
one
or
several
persons
on
this
matter
the
convention
voted
first
one
way
and
then
another
finally
it
agreed
on  single
executive
chosen
indirectly
by
electors
selected
as
the
state
legislatures
might
decide
serving
for
four
years
subject
to
impeachment
and
endowed
with
regal
powers
in
the
command
of
the
army
and
the
navy
and
in
the
enforcement
of
the
laws
the
legislative
branch
congress
after
the
convention
had
made
the
great
compromise
between
the
large
and
small
commonwealths
by
giving
representation
to
states
in
the
senate
and
to
population
in
the
house
the
question
of
methods
of
election
had
to
be
decided
as
to
the
house
of
representatives
it
was
readily
agreed
that
the
members
should
be
elected
by
direct
popular
vote
there
was
also
easy
agreement
on
the
proposition
that  strong
senate
was
needed
to
check
the
turbulence
of
the
lower
house
four
devices
were
finally
selected
to
accomplish
this
purpose
in
the
first
place
the
senators
were
not
to
be
chosen
directly
by
the
voters
but
by
the
legislatures
of
the
states
thus
removing
their
election
one
degree
from
the
populace
in
the
second
place
their
term
was
fixed
at
six
years
instead
of
two
as
in
the
case
of
the
house
in
the
third
place
provision
was
made
for
continuity
by
having
only
one
third
of
the
members
go
out
at  time
while
two
thirds
remained
in
service
finally
it
was
provided
that
senators
must
be
at
least
thirty
years
old
while
representatives
need
be
only
twenty
five
the
judiciary
the
need
for
federal
courts
to
carry
out
the
law
was
hardly
open
to
debate
the
feebleness
of
the
articles
of
confederation
was
in  large
measure
attributed
to
the
want
of  judiciary
to
hold
states
and
individuals
in
obedience
to
the
laws
and
treaties
of
the
union
nevertheless
on
this
point
the
advocates
of
states
rights
were
extremely
sensitive
they
looked
with
distrust
upon
judges
appointed
at
the
national
capital
and
emancipated
from
local
interests
and
traditions
they
remembered
with
what
insistence
they
had
claimed
against
britain
the
right
of
local
trial
by
jury
and
with
what
consternation
they
had
viewed
the
proposal
to
make
colonial
judges
independent
of
the
assemblies
in
the
matter
of
their
salaries
reluctantly
they
yielded
to
the
demand
for
federal
courts
consenting
at
first
only
to  supreme
court
to
review
cases
heard
in
lower
state
courts
and
finally
to
such
additional
inferior
courts
as
congress
might
deem
necessary
the
system
of
checks
and
balances
it
is
thus
apparent
that
the
framers
of
the
constitution
in
shaping
the
form
of
government
arranged
for  distribution
of
power
among
three
branches
executive
legislative
and
judicial
strictly
speaking
we
might
say
four
branches
for
the
legislature
or
congress
was
composed
of
two
houses
elected
in
different
ways
and
one
of
them
the
senate
was
made  check
on
the
president
through
its
power
of
ratifying
treaties
and
appointments
the
accumulation
of
all
powers
legislative
executive
and
judicial
in
the
same
hands
wrote
madison
whether
of
one  few
or
many
and
whether
hereditary
self
appointed
or
elective
may
justly
be
pronounced
the
very
definition
of
tyranny
the
devices
which
the
convention
adopted
to
prevent
such  centralization
of
authority
were
exceedingly
ingenious
and
well
calculated
to
accomplish
the
purposes
of
the
authors
the
legislature
consisted
of
two
houses
the
members
of
which
were
to
be
apportioned
on  different
basis
elected
in
different
ways
and
to
serve
for
different
terms  veto
on
all
its
acts
was
vested
in  president
elected
in  manner
not
employed
in
the
choice
of
either
branch
of
the
legislature
serving
for
four
years
and
subject
to
removal
only
by
the
difficult
process
of
impeachment
after  law
had
run
the
gantlet
of
both
houses
and
the
executive
it
was
subject
to
interpretation
and
annulment
by
the
judiciary
appointed
by
the
president
with
the
consent
of
the
senate
and
serving
for
life
thus
it
was
made
almost
impossible
for
any
political
party
to
get
possession
of
all
branches
of
the
government
at  single
popular
election
as
hamilton
remarked
the
friends
of
good
government
considered
every
institution
calculated
to
restrain
the
excess
of
law
making
and
to
keep
things
in
the
same
state
in
which
they
happen
to
be
at
any
given
period
as
more
likely
to
do
good
than
harm
the
powers
of
the
federal
government
on
the
question
of
the
powers
to
be
conferred
upon
the
new
government
there
was
less
occasion
for  serious
dispute
even
the
delegates
from
the
small
states
agreed
with
those
from
massachusetts
pennsylvania
and
virginia
that
new
powers
should
be
added
to
those
intrusted
to
congress
by
the
articles
of
confederation
the
new
jersey
plan
as
well
as
the
virginia
plan
recognized
this
fact
some
of
the
delegates
like
hamilton
and
madison
even
proposed
to
give
congress  general
legislative
authority
covering
all
national
matters
but
others
frightened
by
the
specter
of
nationalism
insisted
on
specifying
each
power
to
be
conferred
and
finally
carried
the
day
taxation
and
commerce
there
were
none
bold
enough
to
dissent
from
the
proposition
that
revenue
must
be
provided
to
pay
current
expenses
and
discharge
the
public
debt
when
once
the
dispute
over
the
apportionment
of
direct
taxes
among
the
slave
states
was
settled
it
was
an
easy
matter
to
decide
that
congress
should
have
power
to
lay
and
collect
taxes
duties
imposts
and
excises
in
this
way
the
national
government
was
freed
from
dependence
upon
stubborn
and
tardy
legislatures
and
enabled
to
collect
funds
directly
from
citizens
there
were
likewise
none
bold
enough
to
contend
that
the
anarchy
of
state
tariffs
and
trade
discriminations
should
be
longer
endured
when
the
fears
of
the
planting
states
were
allayed
and
the
bargain
over
the
importation
of
slaves
was
reached
the
convention
vested
in
congress
the
power
to
regulate
foreign
and
interstate
commerce
national
defense
the
necessity
for
national
defense
was
realized
though
the
fear
of
huge
military
establishments
was
equally
present
the
old
practice
of
relying
on
quotas
furnished
by
the
state
legislatures
was
completely
discredited
as
in
the
case
of
taxes  direct
authority
over
citizens
was
demanded
congress
was
therefore
given
full
power
to
raise
and
support
armies
and  navy
it
could
employ
the
state
militia
when
desirable
but
it
could
at
the
same
time
maintain  regular
army
and
call
directly
upon
all
able
bodied
males
if
the
nature
of  crisis
was
thought
to
require
it
the
necessary
and
proper
clause
to
the
specified
power
vested
in
congress
by
the
constitution
the
advocates
of  strong
national
government
added  general
clause
authorizing
it
to
make
all
laws
necessary
and
proper
for
carrying
into
effect
any
and
all
of
the
enumerated
powers
this
clause
interpreted
by
that
master
mind
chief
justice
marshall
was
later
construed
to
confer
powers
as
wide
as
the
requirements
of  vast
country
spanning  continent
and
taking
its
place
among
the
mighty
nations
of
the
earth
restraints
on
the
states
framing  government
and
endowing
it
with
large
powers
were
by
no
means
the
sole
concern
of
the
convention
its
very
existence
had
been
due
quite
as
much
to
the
conduct
of
the
state
legislatures
as
to
the
futilities
of  paralyzed
continental
congress
in
every
state
explains
marshall
in
his
life
of
washington
there
was  party
of
men
who
had
marked
out
for
themselves  more
indulgent
course
viewing
with
extreme
tenderness
the
case
of
the
debtor
their
efforts
were
unceasingly
directed
to
his
relief
to
exact  faithful
compliance
with
contracts
was
in
their
opinion  harsh
measure
which
the
people
could
not
bear
they
were
uniformly
in
favor
of
relaxing
the
administration
of
justice
of
affording
facilities
for
the
payment
of
debts
or
of
suspending
their
collection
and
remitting
taxes
the
legislatures
under
the
dominance
of
these
men
had
enacted
paper
money
laws
enabling
debtors
to
discharge
their
obligations
more
easily
the
convention
put
an
end
to
such
practices
by
providing
that
no
state
should
emit
bills
of
credit
or
make
anything
but
gold
or
silver
legal
tender
in
the
payment
of
debts
the
state
legislatures
had
enacted
laws
allowing
men
to
pay
their
debts
by
turning
over
to
creditors
land
or

answered
by  brief
sentence
to
the
effect
that
the
president
of
the
united
states
to
be
equipped
with  regular
army
would
send
troops
to
suppress
domestic
insurrections
whenever
called

by

or
if
it
was
not

provisions
for
ratification
and
amendment
when
the
frame
of
government
had
been
determined
the
powers
to
be
vested
in
it
had
been
enumerated
and
the
restrictions
upon
the
states
had
been
written
into
the
bond
there
remained
three
final
questions
how
shall
the
constitution
be
ratified
what
number
of
states
shall
be
necessary
to
put
it
into
effect
how
shall
it
be
amended
in
the
future
on
the
first
point
the
mandate
under
which
the
convention
was
sitting
seemed
positive
the
articles
of
confederation
were
still
in
effect
they
provided
that
amendments
could
be
made
only
by
unanimous
adoption
in
congress
and
the
approval
of
all
the
states
as
if
to
give
force
to
this
provision
of
law
the
call
for
the
convention
had
expressly
stated
that
all
alterations
and
revisions
should
be
reported
to
congress
for
adoption
or
rejection
congress
itself
to
transmit
the
document
thereafter
to
the
states
for
their
review
to
have
observed
the
strict
letter
of
the
law
would
have
defeated
the
purposes
of
the
delegates
because
congress
and
the
state
legislatures
were
openly
hostile
to
such
drastic
changes
as
had
been
made
unanimous
ratification
as
events
proved
would
have
been
impossible
therefore
the
delegates
decided
that
the
constitution
should
be
sent
to
congress
with
the
recommendation
that
it
in
turn
transmit
the
document
not
to
the
state
legislatures
but
to
conventions
held
in
the
states
for
the
special
object
of
deciding
upon
ratification
this
process
was
followed
it
was
their
belief
that
special
conventions
would
be
more
friendly
than
the
state
legislatures
the
convention
was
equally
positive
in
dealing
with
the
problem
of
the
number
of
states
necessary
to
establish
the
new
constitution
attempts
to
change
the
articles
had
failed
because
amendment
required
the
approval
of
every
state
and
there
was
always
at
least
one
recalcitrant
member
of
the
union
the
opposition
to  new
constitution
was
undoubtedly
formidable
rhode
island
had
even
refused
to
take
part
in
framing
it
and
her
hostility
was
deep
and
open
so
the
convention
cast
aside
the
provision
of
the
articles
of
confederation
which
required
unanimous
approval
for
any
change
in
the
plan
of
government
it
decreed
that
the
new
constitution
should
go
into
effect
when
ratified
by
nine
states
in
providing
for
future
changes
in
the
constitution
itself
the
convention
also
thrust
aside
the
old
rule
of
unanimous
approval
and
decided
that
an
amendment
could
be
made
on  two
thirds
vote
in
both
houses
of
congress
and
ratification
by
three
fourths
of
the
states
this
change
was
of
profound
significance
every
state
agreed
to
be
bound
in
the
future
by
amendments
duly
adopted
even
in
case
it
did
not
approve
them
itself
america
in
this
way
set
out
upon
the
high
road
that
led
from  league
of
states
to  nation
the
struggle
over
ratification
on
september
the
constitution
having
been
finally
drafted
in

the

urged

who
had
been

to

several
members
of
the
house
of
representatives
headed
by
james
madison
had
also
been

strengthened

selection
of
officials

thomas

the

was
reckoned
as  doubter
in
the
house
of
the
faithful
he
had
expressed
opinions
both
for
and
against
the
constitution
but
he
had
been
out
of
the
country
acting
as
the
minister
at
paris
when
the
constitution
was
drafted
and
ratified
an
opposition
to
conciliate
the
inauguration
of
washington
amid
the
plaudits
of
his
countrymen
did
not
set
at
rest
all
the
political
turmoil
which
had
been
aroused
by
the
angry
contest
over
ratification
the
interesting
nature
of
the
question
wrote
john
marshall
the
equality
of
the
parties
the
animation
produced
inevitably
by
ardent
debate
had  necessary
tendency
to
embitter
the
dispositions
of
the
vanquished
and
to
fix
more
deeply
in
many
bosoms
their
prejudices
against  plan
of
government
in
opposition
to
which
all
their
passions
were
enlisted
the
leaders
gathered
around
washington
were
well
aware
of
the
excited
state
of
the
country
they
saw
rhode
island
and
north
carolina
still
outside
of
the
union
they
knew
by
what
small
margins
the
constitution
had
been
approved
in
the
great
states
of
massachusetts
virginia
and
new
york
they
were
equally
aware
that  majority
of
the
state
conventions
in
yielding
reluctant
approval
to
the
constitution
had
drawn  number
of
amendments
for
immediate
submission
to
the
states
the
first
amendments  bill
of
rights
to
meet
the
opposition
madison
proposed
and
the
first
congress
adopted  series
of
amendments
to
the
constitution
ten
of
them
were
soon
ratified
and
became
in  part
of
the
law
of
the
land
these
amendments
provided
among
other
things
that
congress
could
make
no
law
respecting
the
establishment
of
religion
abridging
the
freedom
of
speech
or
of
the
press
or
the
right
of
the
people
peaceably
to
assemble
and
petition
the
government
for  redress
of
grievances
they
also
guaranteed
indictment
by
grand
jury
and
trial
by
jury
for
all
persons
charged
by
federal
officers
with
serious
crimes
to
reassure
those
who
still
feared
that
local
rights
might
be
invaded
by
the
federal
government
the
tenth
amendment
expressly
provided
that
the
powers
not
delegated
to
the
united
states
by
the
constitution
nor
prohibited
by
it
to
the
states
are
reserved
to
the
states
respectively
or
to
the
people
seven
years
later
the
eleventh
amendment
was
written
in
the
same
spirit
as
the
first
ten
after  heated
debate
over
the
action
of
the
supreme
court
in
permitting  citizen
to
bring  suit
against
the
sovereign
state
of
georgia
the
new
amendment
was
designed
to
protect
states
against
the
federal
judiciary
by
forbidding
it
to
hear
any
case
in
which  state
was
sued
by  citizen
funding

debt
paper
declarations
of
rights
however
paid
no
bills
to
this
task
hamilton
turned
all
his
splendid
genius
at
the
very
outset
he
addressed
himself
to
the
problem
of
the
huge
public
debt
daily
mounting
as
the
unpaid
interest
accumulated
in  report
on
public
credit
under
date
of
january
one
of
the
first
and
greatest
of
american
state
papers
he
laid
before
congress
the
outlines
of
his
plan
he
proposed
that
the
federal
government
should
call
in
all
the
old
bonds
certificates
of
indebtedness
and
other
promises
to
pay
which
had
been
issued
by
the
congress
since
the
beginning
of
the
revolution
these
national
obligations
he
urged
should
be
put
into
one
consolidated
debt
resting
on
the
credit
of
the
united
states
to
the
holders
of
the
old
paper
should
be
issued
new
bonds
drawing
interest
at
fixed
rates
this
process
was
called
funding
the
debt
such  provision
for
the
support
of
public
credit
hamilton
insisted
would
satisfy
creditors
restore
landed
property
to
its
former
value
and
furnish
new
resources
to
agriculture
and
commerce
in
the
form
of
credit
and
capital
assumption
and
funding
of
state
debts
hamilton
then
turned
to
the
obligations
incurred
by
the
several
states
in
support
of
the
revolution
these
debts
he
proposed
to
add
to
the
national
debt
they
were
to
be
assumed
by
the
united
states
government
and
placed
on
the
same
secure
foundation
as
the
continental
debt
this
measure
he
defended
not
merely
on
grounds
of
national
honor
it
would
as
he
foresaw
give
strength
to
the
new
national
government
by
making
all
public
creditors
men
of
substance
in
their
several
communities
look
to
the
federal
rather
than
the
state
government
for
the
satisfaction
of
their
claims
funding
at
face
value
on
the
question
of
the
terms
of
consolidation
assumption
and
funding
hamilton
had  firm
conviction
that
millions
of
dollars
worth
of
the
continental
and
state
bonds
had
passed
out
of
the
hands
of
those
who
had
originally
subscribed
their
funds
to
the
support
of
the
government
or
had
sold
supplies
for
the
revolutionary
army
was
well
known
it
was
also  matter
of
common
knowledge
that  very
large
part
of
these
bonds
had
been
bought
by
speculators
at
ruinous
figures
ten
twenty
and
thirty
cents
on
the
dollar
accordingly
it
had
been
suggested
even
in
very
respectable
quarters
that  discrimination
should
be
made
between
original
holders
and
speculative
purchasers
some
who
held
this
opinion
urged
that
the
speculators
who
had
paid
nominal
sums
for
their
bonds
should
be
reimbursed
for
their
outlays
and
the
original
holders
paid
the
difference
others
said
that
the
government
should
scale
the
debt
by
redeeming
not
at
full
value
but
at  figure
reasonably
above
the
market
price
against
the
proposition
hamilton
set
his
face
like
flint
he
maintained
that
the
government
was
honestly
bound
to
redeem
every
bond
at
its
face
value
although
the
difficulty
of
securing
revenue
made
necessary  lower
rate
of
interest
on  part
of
the
bonds
and
the
deferring
of
interest
on
another
part
funding
and
assumption
carried
there
was
little
difficulty
in
securing
the
approval
of
both
houses
of
congress
for
the
funding
of
the
national
debt
at
full
value
the
bill
for
the
assumption
of
state
debts
however
brought
the
sharpest
division
of
opinions
to
the
southern
members
of
congress
assumption
was  gross
violation
of
states
rights
without
any
warrant
in
the
constitution
and
devised
in
the
interest
of
northern
speculators
who
anticipating
assumption
and
funding
had
bought
up
at
low
prices
the
southern
bonds
and
other
promises
to
pay
new
england
on
the
other
hand
was
strongly
in
favor
of
assumption
several
representatives
from
that
section
were
rash
enough
to
threaten  dissolution
of
the
union
if
the
bill
was
defeated
to
this
dispute
was
added
an
equally
bitter
quarrel
over
the
location
of
the
national
capital
then
temporarily
at
new
york
city
illustration
first
united
states
bank
at
philadelphia  deadlock
accompanied
by
the
most
surly
feelings
on
both
sides
threatened
the
very
existence
of
the
young
government
washington
and
hamilton
were
thoroughly
alarmed
hearing
of
the
extremity
to
which
the
contest
had
been
carried
and
acting
on
the
appeal
from
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
jefferson
intervened
at
this
point
by
skillful
management
at  good
dinner
he
brought
the
opposing
leaders
together
and
thus
once
more
as
on
many
other
occasions
peace
was
purchased
and
the
union
saved
by
compromise
the
bargain
this
time
consisted
of
an
exchange
of
votes
for
assumption
in
return
for
votes
for
the
capital
enough
southern
members
voted
for
assumption
to
pass
the
bill
and  majority
was
mustered
in
favor
of
building
the
capital
on
the
banks
of
the
potomac
after
locating
it
for  ten
year
period
at
philadelphia
to
satisfy
pennsylvania
members
the
united
states
bank
encouraged
by
the
success
of
his
funding
and
assumption
measures
hamilton
laid
before
congress  project
for  great
united
states
bank
he
proposed
that  private
corporation
be
chartered
by
congress
authorized
to
raise  capital
stock
of
three
fourths
in
new
six
per
cent
federal
bonds
and
one
fourth
in
specie
and
empowered
to
issue
paper
currency
under
proper
safeguards
many
advantages
hamilton
contended
would
accrue
to
the
government
from
this
institution
the
price
of
the
government
bonds
would
be
increased
thus
enhancing
public
credit  national
currency
would
be
created
of
uniform
value
from
one
end
of
the
land
to
the
other
the
branches
of
the
bank
in
various
cities
would
make
easy
the
exchange
of
funds
so
vital
to
commercial
transactions
on  national
scale
finally
through
the
issue
of
bank
notes
the
money
capital
available
for
agriculture
and
industry
would
be
increased
thus
stimulating
business
enterprise
jefferson
hotly
attacked
the
bank
on
the
ground
that
congress
had
no
power
whatever
under
the
constitution
to
charter
such  private
corporation
hamilton
defended
it
with
great
cogency
washington
after
weighing
all
opinions
decided
in
favor
of
the
proposal
in
the
bill
establishing
the
first
united
states
bank
for  period
of
twenty
years
became  law
the
protective
tariff  third
part
of
hamilton  program
was
the
protection
of
american
industries
the
first
revenue
act
of
though
designed
primarily
to
bring
money
into
the
empty
treasury
declared
in
favor
of
the
principle
the
following
year
washington
referred
to
the
subject
in
his
address
to
congress
thereupon
hamilton
was
instructed
to
prepare
recommendations
for
legislative
action
the
result
after  delay
of
more
than  year
was
his
report
on
manufactures
another
state
paper
worthy
in
closeness
of
reasoning
and
keenness
of
understanding
of  place
beside
his
report
on
public
credit
hamilton
based
his
argument
on
the
broadest
national
grounds
the
protective
tariff
would
by
encouraging
the
building
of
factories
create  home
market
for
the
produce
of
farms
and
plantations
by
making
the
united
states
independent
of
other
countries
in
times
of
peace
it
would
double
its
security
in
time
of
war
by
making
use
of
the
labor
of
women
and
children
it
would
turn
to
the
production
of
goods
persons
otherwise
idle
or
only
partly
employed
by
increasing
the
trade
between
the
north
and
south
it
would
strengthen
the
links
of
union
and
add
to
political
ties
those
of
commerce
and
intercourse
the
revenue
measure
of
bore
the
impress
of
these
arguments
the
rise
of
political
parties
dissensions
over
hamilton  measures
hamilton  plans
touching
deeply
as
they
did
the
resources
of
individuals
and
the
interests
of
the
states
awakened
alarm
and
opposition
funding
at
face
value
said
his
critics
was  government
favor
to
speculators
the
assumption
of
state
debts
was  deep
design
to
undermine
the
state
governments
congress
had
no
constitutional
power
to
create  bank
the
law
creating
the
bank
merely
allowed  private
corporation
to
make
paper
money
and
lend
it
at  high
rate
of
interest
and
the
tariff
was  tax
on
land
and
labor
for
the
benefit
of
manufacturers
hamilton  reply
to
this
bill
of
indictment
was
simple
and
straightforward
some
rascally
speculators
had
profited
from
the
funding
of
the
debt
at
face
value
but
that
was
only
an
incident
in
the
restoration
of
public
credit
in
view
of
the
jealousies
of
the
states
it
was  good
thing
to
reduce
their
powers
and
pretensions
the
constitution
was
not
to
be
interpreted
narrowly
but
in
the
full
light
of
national
needs
the
bank
would
enlarge
the
amount
of
capital
so
sorely
needed
to
start
up
american
industries
giving
markets
to
farmers
and
planters
the
tariff
by
creating  home
market
and
increasing
opportunities
for
employment
would
benefit
both
land
and
labor
out
of
such
wise
policies
firmly
pursued
by
the
government
he
concluded
were
bound
to
come
strength
and
prosperity
for
the
new
government
at
home
credit
and
power
abroad
this
view
washington
fully
indorsed
adding
the
weight
of
his
great
name
to
the
inherent
merits
of
the
measures
adopted
under
his
administration
the
sharpness
of
the
partisan
conflict
as  result
of
the
clash
of
opinion
the
people
of
the
country
gradually
divided
into
two
parties
federalists
and
anti
federalists
the
former
led
by
hamilton
the
latter
by
jefferson
the
strength
of
the
federalists
lay
in
the
cities
boston
providence
hartford
new
york
philadelphia
charleston
among
the
manufacturing
financial
and
commercial
groups
of
the
population
who
were
eager
to
extend
their
business
operations
the
strength
of
the
anti
federalists
lay
mainly
among
the
debt
burdened
farmers
who
feared
the
growth
of
what
they
called  money
power
and
planters
in
all
sections
who
feared
the
dominance
of
commercial
and
manufacturing
interests
the
farming
and
planting
south
outside
of
the
few
towns
finally
presented
an
almost
solid
front
against
assumption
the
bank
and
the
tariff
the
conflict
between
the
parties
grew
steadily
in
bitterness
despite
the
conciliatory
and
engaging
manner
in
which
hamilton
presented
his
cause
in
his
state
papers
and
despite
the
constant
efforts
of
washington
to
soften
the
asperity
of
the
contestants
the
leadership
and
doctrines
of
jefferson
the
party
dispute
had
not
gone
far
before
the
opponents
of
the
administration
began
to
look
to
jefferson
as
their
leader
some
of
hamilton  measures
he
had
approved
declaring
afterward
that
he
did
not
at
the
time
understand
their
significance
others
particularly
the
bank
he
fiercely
assailed
more
than
once
he
and
hamilton
shaking
violently
with
anger
attacked
each
other
at
cabinet
meetings
and
nothing
short
of
the
grave
and
dignified
pleas
of
washington
prevented
an
early
and
open
break
between
them
in
it
finally
came
jefferson
resigned
as
secretary
of
state
and
retired
to
his
home
in
virginia
to
assume
through
correspondence
and
negotiation
the
leadership
of
the
steadily
growing
party
of
opposition
shy
and
modest
in
manner
halting
in
speech
disliking
the
turmoil
of
public
debate
and
deeply
interested
in
science
and
philosophy
jefferson
was
not
very
well
fitted
for
the
strenuous
life
of
political
contest
nevertheless
he
was
an
ambitious
and
shrewd
negotiator
he
was
also
by
honest
opinion
and
matured
conviction
the
exact
opposite
of
hamilton
the
latter
believed
in  strong
active
high
toned
government
vigorously
compelling
in
all
its
branches
jefferson
looked
upon
such
government
as
dangerous
to
the
liberties
of
citizens
and
openly
avowed
his
faith
in
the
desirability
of
occasional
popular
uprisings
hamilton
distrusted
the
people
your
people
is  great
beast
he
is
reported
to
have
said
jefferson
professed
his
faith
in
the
people
with
an
abandon
that
was
considered
reckless
in
his
time
on
economic
matters
the
opinions
of
the
two
leaders
were
also
hopelessly
at
variance
hamilton
while
cherishing
agriculture
desired
to
see
america  great
commercial
and
industrial
nation
jefferson
was
equally
set
against
this
course
for
his
country
he
feared
the
accumulation
of
riches
and
the
growth
of  large
urban
working
class
the
mobs
of
great
cities
he
said
are
sores
on
the
body
politic
artisans
are
usually
the
dangerous
element
that
make
revolutions
workshops
should
be
kept
in
europe
and
with
them
the
artisans
with
their
insidious
morals
and
manners
the
only
substantial
foundation
for  republic
jefferson
believed
to
be
agriculture
the
spirit
of
independence
could
be
kept
alive
only
by
free
farmers
owning
the
land
they
tilled
and
looking
to
the
sun
in
heaven
and
the
labor
of
their
hands
for
their
sustenance
trusting
as
he
did
in
the
innate
goodness
of
human
nature
when
nourished
on  free
soil
jefferson
advocated
those
measures
calculated
to
favor
agriculture
and
to
enlarge
the
rights
of
persons
rather
than
the
powers
of
government
thus
he
became
the
champion
of
the
individual
against
the
interference
of
the
government
and
an
ardent
advocate
of
freedom
of
the
press
freedom
of
speech
and
freedom
of
scientific
inquiry
it
was
accordingly
no
mere
factious
spirit
that
drove
him
into
opposition
to
hamilton
the
whisky
rebellion
the
political
agitation
of
the
anti
federalists
was
accompanied
by
an
armed
revolt
against
the
government
in
the
occasion
for
this
uprising
was
another
of
hamilton  measures  law
laying
an
excise
tax
on
distilled
spirits
for
the
purpose
of
increasing
the
revenue
needed
to
pay
the
interest
on
the
funded
debt
it
so
happened
that  very
considerable
part
of
the
whisky
manufactured
in
the
country
was
made
by
the
farmers
especially
on
the
frontier
in
their
own
stills
the
new
revenue
law
meant
that
federal
officers
would
now
come
into
the
homes
of
the
people
measure
their
liquor
and
take
the
tax
out
of
their
pockets
all
the
bitterness
which
farmers
felt
against
the
fiscal
measures
of
the
government
was
redoubled
in
the
western
districts
of
pennsylvania
virginia
and
north
carolina
they
refused
to
pay
the
tax
in
pennsylvania
some
of
them
sacked
and
burned
the
houses
of
the
tax
collectors
as
the
revolutionists
thirty
years
before
had
mobbed
the
agents
of
king
george
sent
over
to
sell
stamps
they
were
in  fair
way
to
nullify
the
law
in
whole
districts
when
washington
called
out
the
troops
to
suppress
the
whisky
rebellion
then
the
movement
collapsed
but
it
left
behind  deep
seated
resentment
which
flared
up
in
the
election
of
several
obdurate
anti
federalist
congressmen
from
the
disaffected
regions
foreign
influences
and
domestic
politics
the
french
revolution
in
this
exciting
period
when
all
america
was
distracted
by
partisan
disputes  storm
broke
in
europe
the
epoch
making
french
revolution
which
not
only
shook
the
thrones
of
the
old
world
but
stirred
to
its
depths
the
young
republic
of
the
new
world
the
first
scene
in
this
dramatic
affair
occurred
in
the
spring
of  few
days
after
washington
was
inaugurated
the
king
of
france
louis
xvi
driven
into
bankruptcy
by
extravagance
and
costly
wars
was
forced
to
resort
to
his
people
for
financial
help
accordingly
he
called
for
the
first
time
in
more
than
one
hundred
fifty
years  meeting
of
the
national
parliament
the
estates
general
composed
of
representatives
of
the
three
estates
the
clergy
nobility
and
commoners
acting
under
powerful
leaders
the
commoners
or
third
estate
swept
aside
the
clergy
and
nobility
and
resolved
themselves
into  national
assembly
this
stirred
the
country
to
its
depths

replied
to

in
another
of
his
famous
tracts
the

which
was
given
to
the
american
public
in
an

burke
said
paine
had
been
mourning
about
the
glories
of
the
french

but
had
forgotten
the
starving

and
the

had
wept
over

and
neglected
the
dying

burke
had
denied
the
right
of
the
french
people
to
choose
their
own
governors
blandly
forgetting
that
the
english
government
in
which
he
saw
final
perfection
itself
rested
on

he
had
boasted
that

that
the

replied
that
the
question
was
not
whether
they
were
new
or
old
but
whether
they
were
right
or
wrong
as
to
the
french
disorders
and
difficulties
he
bade
the

wait
to
see
what
would
be
brought
forth
in

the
effect
of
the
french
revolution
on
american
politics
the
course
of
the
french

and
the
controversies
accompanying
it
exercised  profound
influence
on
the

of

the

of

of

drew
back
in
fright
as
they
heard
of
the
cruel
deeds
committed
during
the
reign
of

they
turned
savagely
upon
the
revolutionists
and
their
friends

as

who
did
not
condemn

enough

assailed
the

of

he
then
proceeded
with
equal
passion
to
attack

they

this

have
gone
on

the

at
the
same
time
the
french
republic
turned
to
the
united
states
for
aid
in
its
war
on
england
and
sent
over
as
its
diplomatic
representative
citizen
genet
an
ardent
supporter
of
the
new
order
on
his
arrival
at
charleston
he
was
greeted
with
fervor
by
the
anti
federalists
as
he
made
his
way
north
he
was
wined
and
dined
and
given
popular
ovations
that
turned
his
head
he
thought
the
whole
country
was
ready
to
join
the
french
republic
in
its
contest
with
england
genet
therefore
attempted
to
use
the
american
ports
as
the
base
of
operations
for
french
privateers
preying
on
british
merchant
ships
and
he
insisted
that
the
united
states
was
in
honor
bound
to
help
france
under
the
treaty
of
the
proclamation
of
neutrality
and
the
jay
treaty
unmoved
by
the
rising
tide
of
popular
sympathy
for
france
washington
took  firm
course
he
received
genet
coldly
the
demand
that
the
united
states
aid
france
under
the
old
treaty
of
alliance
he
answered
by
proclaiming
the
neutrality
of
america
and
warning
american
citizens
against
hostile
acts
toward
either
france
or
england
when
genet
continued
to
hold
meetings
issue
manifestoes
and
stir
up
the
people
against
england
washington
asked
the
french
government
to
recall
him
this
act
he
followed
up
by
sending
the
chief
justice
john
jay
on  pacific
mission
to
england
the
result
was
the
celebrated
jay
treaty
of
by
its
terms
great
britain
agreed
to
withdraw
her
troops
from
the
western
forts
where
they
had
been
since
the
war
for
independence
and
to
grant
certain
slight
trade
concessions
the
chief
sources
of
bitterness
the
failure
of
the
british
to
return
slaves
carried
off
during
the
revolution
the
seizure
of
american
ships
and
the
impressment
of
sailors
were
not
touched
much
to
the
distress
of
everybody
in
america
including
loyal
federalists
nevertheless
washington
dreading
an
armed
conflict
with
england
urged
the
senate
to
ratify
the
treaty
the
weight
of
his
influence
carried
the
day
at
this
the
hostility
of
the
anti
federalists
knew
no
bounds
jefferson
declared
the
jay
treaty
an
infamous
act
which
is
really
nothing
more
than
an
alliance
between
england
and
the
anglo
men
of
this
country
against
the
legislature
and
the
people
of
the
united
states
hamilton
defending
it
with
his
usual
courage
was
stoned
by  mob
in
new
york
and
driven
from
the
platform
with
blood
streaming
from
his
face
jay
was
burned
in
effigy
even
washington
was
not
spared
the
house
of
representatives
was
openly
hostile
to
display
its
feelings
it
called
upon
the
president
for
the
papers
relative
to
the
treaty
negotiations
only
to
be
more
highly
incensed
by
his
flat
refusal
to
present
them
on
the
ground
that
the
house
did
not
share
in
the
treaty
making
power
washington
retires
from
politics
such
angry
contests
confirmed
the
president
in
his
slowly
maturing
determination
to
retire
at
the
end
of
his
second
term
in
office
he
did
not
believe
that  third
term
was
unconstitutional
or
improper
but
worn
out
by
his
long
and
arduous
labors
in
war
and
in
peace
and
wounded
by
harsh
attacks
from
former
friends
he
longed
for
the
quiet
of
his
beautiful
estate
at
mount
vernon
in
september
on
the
eve
of
the
presidential
election
washington
issued
his
farewell
address
another
state
paper
to
be
treasured
and
read
by
generations
of
americans
to
come
in
this
address
he
directed
the
attention
of
the
people
to
three
subjects
of
lasting
interest
he
warned
them
against
sectional
jealousies
he
remonstrated
against
the
spirit
of
partisanship
saying
that
in
government
of
the
popular
character
in
government
purely
elective
it
is  spirit
not
to
be
encouraged
he
likewise
cautioned
the
people
against
the
insidious
wiles
of
foreign
influence
saying
europe
has  set
of
primary
interests
which
to
us
have
none
or  very
remote
relation
hence
she
must
be
engaged
in
frequent
controversies
the
causes
of
which
are
essentially
foreign
to
our
concerns
hence
therefore
it
would
be
unwise
in
us
to
implicate
ourselves
by
artificial
ties
in
the
ordinary
vicissitudes
of
her
politics
or
the
ordinary
combinations
and
collisions
of
her
friendships
or
enmities
why
forego
the
advantages
of
so
peculiar  situation
it
is
our
true
policy
to
steer
clear
of
permanent
alliances
with
any
portion
of
the
foreign
world
taking
care
always
to
keep
ourselves
by
suitable
establishments
on  respectable
defensive
posture
we
may
safely
trust
to
temporary
alliances
for
extraordinary
emergencies
the
campaign
of
adams
elected
on
hearing
of
the
retirement
of
washington
the
anti
federalists
cast
off
all
restraints
in
honor
of
france
and
in
opposition
to
what
they
were
pleased
to
call
the
monarchical
tendencies
of
the
federalists
they
boldly
assumed
the
name
republican
the
term
democrat
then
applied
only
to
obscure
and
despised
radicals
had
not
come
into
general
use
they
selected
jefferson
as
their
candidate
for
president
against
john
adams
the
federalist
nominee
and
carried
on
such  spirited
campaign
that
they
came
within
four
votes
of
electing
him
the
successful
candidate
adams
was
not
fitted
by
training
or
opinion
for
conciliating  determined
opposition
he
was  reserved
and
studious
man
he
was
neither  good
speaker
nor  skillful
negotiator
in
one
of
his
books
he
had
declared
himself
in
favor
of
government
by
an
aristocracy
of
talents
and
wealth
an
offense
which
the
republicans
never
forgave
while
john
marshall
found
him  sensible
plain
candid
good
tempered
man
jefferson
could
see
in
him
nothing
but  monocrat
and
anglo
man
had
it
not
been
for
the
conduct
of
the
french
government
adams
would
hardly
have
enjoyed  moment  genuine
popularity
during
his
administration
the
quarrel
with
france
the
french
directory
the
executive
department
established
under
the
constitution
of
managed
however
to
stir
the
anger
of
republicans
and
federalists
alike
it
regarded
the
jay
treaty
as  rebuke
to
france
and  flagrant
violation
of
obligations
solemnly
registered
in
the
treaty
of
accordingly
it
refused
to
receive
the
american
minister
treated
him
in  humiliating
way
and
finally
told
him
to
leave
the
country
overlooking
this
affront
in
his
anxiety
to
maintain
peace
adams
dispatched
to
france  commission
of
eminent
men
with
instructions
to
reach
an
understanding
with
the
french
republic
on
their
arrival
they
were
chagrined
to
find
instead
of  decent
reception
an
indirect
demand
for
an
apology
respecting
the
past
conduct
of
the
american
government  payment
in
cash
and
an
annual
tribute
as
the
price
of
continued
friendship
when
the
news
of
this
affair
reached
president
adams
he
promptly
laid
it
before
congress
referring
to
the
frenchmen
who
had
made
the
demands
as
mr  mr  and
mr  this
insult
coupled
with
the
fact
that
french
privateers
like
the
british
were
preying
upon
american
commerce
enraged
even
the
republicans
who
had
been
loudest
in
the
profession
of
their
french
sympathies
they
forgot
their
wrath
over
the
jay
treaty
and
joined
with
the
federalists
in
shouting
millions
for
defense
not  cent
for
tribute
preparations
for
war
were
made
on
every
hand
washington
was
once
more
called
from
mount
vernon
to
take
his
old
position
at
the
head
of
the
army
indeed
fighting
actually
began
upon
the
high
seas
and
went
on
without  formal
declaration
of
war
until
the
year
by
that
time
the
directory
had
been
overthrown  treaty
was
readily
made
with
napoleon
the
first
consul
who
was
beginning
his
remarkable
career
as
chief
of
the
french
republic
soon
to
be
turned
into
an
empire
alien
and
sedition
laws
flushed
with
success
the
federalists
determined
if
possible
to
put
an
end
to
radical
french
influence
in
america
and
to
silence
republican
opposition
they
therefore
passed
two
drastic
laws
in
the
summer
of
the
alien
and
sedition
acts
the
first
of
these
measures
empowered
the
president
to
expel
from
the
country
or
to
imprison
any
alien
whom
he
regarded
as
dangerous
or
had
reasonable
grounds
to
suspect
of
any
treasonable
or
secret
machinations
against
the
government
the
second
of
the
measures
the
sedition
act
penalized
not
only
those
who
attempted
to
stir
up
unlawful
combinations
against
the
government
but
also
every
one
who
wrote
uttered
or
published
any
false
scandalous
and
malicious
writing
against
the
government
of
the
united
states
or
either
house
of
congress
or
the
president
of
the
united
states
with
intent
to
defame
said
government
or
to
bring
them
or
either
of
them
into
contempt
or
disrepute
this
measure
was
hurried
through
congress
in
spite
of
the
opposition
and
the
clear
provision
in
the
constitution
that
congress
shall
make
no
law
abridging
the
freedom
of
speech
or
of
the
press
even
many
federalists
feared
the
consequences
of
the
action
hamilton
was
alarmed
when
he
read
the
bill
exclaiming
let
us
not
establish  tyranny
energy
is  very
different
thing
from
violence
john
marshall
told
his
friends
in
virginia
that
had
he
been
in
congress
he
would
have
opposed
the
two
bills
because
he
thought
them
useless
and
calculated
to
create
unnecessary
discontents
and
jealousies
the
alien
law
was
not
enforced
but
it
gave
great
offense
to
the
irish
and
french
whose
activities
against
the
american
government  policy
respecting
great
britain
put
them
in
danger
of
prison
the
sedition
law
on
the
other
hand
was
vigorously
applied
several
editors
of
republican
newspapers
soon
found
themselves
in
jail
or
broken
by
ruinous
fines
for
their
caustic
criticisms
of
the
federalist
president
and
his
policies
bystanders
at
political
meetings
who
uttered
sentiments
which
though
ungenerous
and
severe
seem
harmless
enough
now
were
hurried
before
federalist
judges
and
promptly
fined
and
imprisoned
although
the
prosecutions
were
not
numerous
they
aroused  keen
resentment
the
republicans
were
convinced
that
their
political
opponents
having
saddled
upon
the
country
hamilton  fiscal
system
and
the
british
treaty
were
bent
on
silencing
all
censure
the
measures
therefore
had
exactly
the
opposite
effect
from
that
which
their
authors
intended
instead
of
helping
the
federalist
party
they
made
criticism
of
it
more
bitter
than
ever
the
kentucky
and
virginia
resolutions
jefferson
was
quick
to
take
advantage
of
the
discontent
he
drafted  set
of
resolutions
declaring
the
sedition
law
null
and
void
as
violating
the
federal
constitution
his
resolutions
were
passed
by
the
kentucky
legislature
late
in
signed
by
the
governor
and
transmitted
to
the
other
states
for
their
consideration
though
receiving
unfavorable
replies
from  number
of
northern
states
kentucky
the
following
year
reaffirmed
its
position
and
declared
that
the
nullification
of
all
unconstitutional
acts
of
congress
was
the
rightful
remedy
to
be
used
by
the
states
in
the
redress
of
grievances
it
thus
defied
the
federal
government
and
announced  doctrine
hostile
to
nationality
and
fraught
with
terrible
meaning
for
the
future
in
the
neighboring
state
of
virginia
madison
led  movement
against
the
alien
and
sedition
laws
he
induced
the
legislature
to
pass
resolutions
condemning
the
acts
as
unconstitutional
and
calling
upon
the
other
states
to
take
proper
means
to
preserve
their
rights
and
the
rights
of
the
people
the
republican
triumph
in
thus
the
way
was
prepared
for
the
election
of
the
republicans
left
no
stone
unturned
in
their
efforts
to
place
on
the
federalist
candidate
president
adams
all
the
odium
of
the
alien
and
sedition
laws
in
addition
to
responsibility
for
approving
hamilton  measures
and
policies
the
federalists
divided
in
councils
and
cold
in
their
affection
for
adams
made  poor
campaign
they
tried
to
discredit
their
opponents
with
epithets
of
jacobins
and
anarchists
terms
which
had
been
weakened
by
excessive
use
when
the
vote
was
counted
it
was
found
that
adams
had
been
defeated
while
the
republicans
had
carried
the
entire
south
and
new
york
also
and
secured
eight
of
the
fifteen
electoral
votes
cast
by
pennsylvania

beloved

lamented  federalist

of

now
you
have
cause
to
triumph
illustration
an
old
cartoon  quarrel
between  federalist
and  republican
in
the
house
of
representatives
jefferson  election
however
was
still
uncertain
by  curious
provision
in
the
constitution
presidential
electors
were
required
to
vote
for
two
persons
without
indicating
which
office
each
was
to
fill
the
one
receiving
the
highest
number
of
votes
to
be
president
and
the
candidate
standing
next
to
be
vice
president
it
so
happened
that
aaron
burr
the
republican
candidate
for
vice
president
had
received
the
same
number
of
votes
as
jefferson
as
neither
had  majority
the
election
was
thrown
into
the
house
of
representatives
where
the
federalists
held
the
balance
of
power
although
it
was
well
known
that
burr
was
not
even  candidate
for
president
his
friends
and
many
federalists
began
intriguing
for
his
election
to
that
high
office
had
it
not
been
for
the
vigorous
action
of
hamilton
the
prize
might
have
been
snatched
out
of
jefferson  hands
not
until
the

sixth
ballot
on

was
the
great
issue
decided

republican
principles

opposition
to

cherishing
especially
the
agricultural
interest
as
jefferson
said
the
republicans
were
in
the
beginning
provincial
in
their
concern
and
outlook
their
attachment
to
america
was
certainly
as
strong
as
that
of
hamilton
but
they
regarded
the
state
rather
than
the
national
government
as
the
proper
center
of
power
and
affection
indeed  large
part
of
the
rank
and
file
had
been
among
the
opponents
of
the
constitution
in
the
days
of
its
adoption
jefferson
had
entertained
doubts
about
it
and
monroe
destined
to
be
the
fifth
president
had
been
one
of
the
bitter
foes
of
ratification
the
former
went
so
far
in
the
direction
of
local
autonomy
that
he
exalted
the
state
above
the
nation
in
the
kentucky
resolutions
of
declaring
the
constitution
to
be  mere
compact
and
the
states
competent
to
interpret
and
nullify
federal
law
this
was
provincialism
with  vengeance
it
is
jealousy
not
confidence
which
prescribes
limited
constitutions
wrote
jefferson
for
the
kentucky
legislature
jealousy
of
the
national
government
not
confidence
in
it
this
is
the
ideal
that
reflected
the
provincial
and
agricultural
interest
republican
simplicity
every
act
of
the
jeffersonian
party
during
its
early
days
of
power
was
in
accord
with
the
ideals
of
government
which
it
professed
it
had
opposed
all
pomp
and
ceremony
calculated
to
give
weight
and
dignity
to
the
chief
executive
of
the
nation
as
symbols
of
monarchy
and
high
prerogative
appropriately
therefore
jefferson  inauguration
on
march
the
first
at
the
new
capital
at
washington
was
marked
by
extreme
simplicity
in
keeping
with
this
procedure
he
quit
the
practice
followed
by
washington
and
adams
of
reading
presidential
addresses
to
congress
in
joint
assembly
and
adopted
in
its
stead
the
plan
of
sending
his
messages
in
writing  custom
that
was
continued
unbroken
until
when
president
wilson
returned
to
the
example
set
by
the
first
chief
magistrate
republican
measures
the
republicans
had
complained
of  great
national
debt
as
the
source
of  dangerous
money
power
giving
strength
to
the
federal
government
accordingly
they
began
to
pay
it
off
as
rapidly
as
possible
they
had
held
commerce
in
low
esteem
and
looked
upon  large
navy
as  mere
device
to
protect
it
consequently
they
reduced
the
number
of
warships
they
had
objected
to
excise
taxes
particularly
on
whisky
these
they
quickly
abolished
to
the
intense
satisfaction
of
the
farmers
they
had
protested
against
the
heavy
cost
of
the
federal
government
they
reduced
expenses
by
discharging
hundreds
of
men
from
the
army
and
abolishing
many
offices
they
had
savagely
criticized
the
sedition
law
and
jefferson
refused
to
enforce
it
they
had
been
deeply
offended
by
the
assault
on
freedom
of
speech
and
press
and
they
promptly
impeached
samuel
chase  justice
of
the
supreme
court
who
had
been
especially
severe
in
his
attacks
upon
offenders
under
the
sedition
act
their
failure
to
convict
justice
chase
by  narrow
margin
was
due
to
no
lack
of
zeal
on
their
part
but
to
the
federalist
strength
in
the
senate
where
the
trial
was
held
they
had
regarded
the
appointment
of  large
number
of
federal
judges
during
the
last
hours
of
adams
administration
as
an
attempt
to
intrench
federalists
in
the
judiciary
and
to
enlarge
the
sphere
of
the
national
government
accordingly
they
at
once
repealed
the
act
creating
the
new
judgeships
thus
depriving
the
midnight
appointees
of
their
posts
they
had
considered
the
federal
offices
civil
and
military
as
sources
of
great
strength
to
the
federalists
and
jefferson
though
committed
to
the
principle
that
offices
should
be
open
to
all
and
distributed
according
to
merit
was
careful
to
fill
most
of
the
vacancies
as
they
occurred
with
trusted
republicans
to
his
credit
however
it
must
be
said
that
he
did
not
make
wholesale
removals
to
find
room
for
party
workers
the
republicans
thus
hewed
to
the
line
of
their
general
policy
of
restricting
the
weight
dignity
and
activity
of
the
national
government
yet
there
were
no
republicans
as
the
federalists
asserted
prepared
to
urge
serious
modifications
in
the
constitution
if
there
be
any
among
us
who
wish
to
dissolve
this
union
or
to
change
its
republican
form
wrote
jefferson
in
his
first
inaugural
let
them
stand
undisturbed
as
monuments
of
the
safety
with
which
error
of
opinion
may
be
tolerated
where
reason
is
left
free
to
combat
it
after
reciting
the
fortunate
circumstances
of
climate
soil
and
isolation
which
made
the
future
of
america
so
full
of
promise
jefferson
concluded  wise
and
frugal
government
which
shall
restrain
men
from
injuring
one
another
shall
leave
them
otherwise
free
to
regulate
their
own
pursuits
of
industry
and
improvement
and
shall
not
take
from
the
mouth
of
labour
the
bread
it
has
earned
this
is
the
sum
of
good
government
and
this
is
necessary
to
close
the
circle
of
our
felicities
in
all
this
the
republicans
had
not
reckoned
with
destiny
in  few
short
years
that
lay
ahead
it
was
their
fate
to
double
the
territory
of
the
country
making
inevitable  continental
nation
to
give
the
constitution  generous
interpretation
that
shocked
many  federalist
to
wage
war
on
behalf
of
american
commerce
to
reestablish
the
hated
united
states
bank
to
enact  high
protective
tariff
to
see
their
federalist
opponents
in
their
turn
discredited
as
nullifiers
and
provincials
to
announce
high
national
doctrines
in
foreign
affairs
and
to
behold
the
constitution
exalted
and
defended
against
the
pretensions
of
states
by  son
of
old
virginia
john
marshall
chief
justice
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
the
republicans
and
the
great
west
expansion
and
land
hunger
the
first
of
the
great
measures
which
drove
the
republicans
out
upon
this
new
national
course
the
purchase
of
the
louisiana
territory
was
the
product
of
circumstances
rather
than
of
their
deliberate
choosing
it
was
not
the
lack
of
land
for
his
cherished
farmers
that
led
jefferson
to
add
such
an
immense
domain
to
the
original
possessions
of
the
united
states
in
the
northwest
territory
now
embracing
ohio
indiana
illinois
michigan
wisconsin
and  portion
of
minnesota
settlements
were
mainly
confined
to
the
north
bank
of
the
ohio
river
to
the
south
in
kentucky
and
tennessee
where
there
were
more
than
one
hundred
thousand
white
people
who
had
pushed
over
the
mountains
from
virginia
and
the
carolinas
there
were
still
wide
reaches
of
untilled
soil
the
alabama
and
mississippi
regions
were
vast
indian
frontiers
of
the
state
of
georgia
unsettled
and
almost
unexplored
even
to
the
wildest
imagination
there
seemed
to
be
territory
enough
to
satisfy
the
land
hunger
of
the
american
people
for  century
to
come
the
significance
of
the
mississippi
river
at
all
events
the
east
then
the
center
of
power
saw
no
good
reason
for
expansion
the
planters
of
the
carolinas
the
manufacturers
of
pennsylvania
the
importers
of
new
york
the
shipbuilders
of
new
england
looking
to
the
seaboard
and
to
europe
for
trade
refinements
and
sometimes
their
ideas
of
government
were
slow
to
appreciate
the
place
of
the
west
in
national
economy
the
better
educated
the
easterners
were
the
less
it
seems
they
comprehended
the
destiny
of
the
nation
sons
of
federalist
fathers
at
williams
college
after  long
debate
decided
by  vote
of
fifteen
to
one
that
the
purchase
of
louisiana
was
undesirable
on
the
other
hand
the
pioneers
of
kentucky
ohio
and
tennessee
unlearned
in
books
saw
with
their
own
eyes
the
resources
of
the
wilderness
many
of
them
had
been
across
the
mississippi
and
had
beheld
the
rich
lands
awaiting
the
plow
of
the
white
man
down
the
great
river
they
floated
their
wheat
corn
and
bacon
to
ocean
going
ships
bound
for
the
ports
of
the
seaboard
or
for
europe
the
land
journeys
over
the
mountain
barriers
with
bulky
farm
produce
they
knew
from
experience
were
almost
impossible
and
costly
at
best
nails
bolts
of
cloth
tea
and
coffee
could
go
or
come
that
way
but
not
corn
and
bacon  free
outlet
to
the
sea
by
the
mississippi
was
as
essential
to
the
pioneers
of
the
kentucky
region
as
the
harbor
of
boston
to
the
merchant
princes
of
that
metropolis
louisiana
under
spanish
rule
for
this
reason
they
watched
with
deep
solicitude
the
fortunes
of
the
spanish
king
to
whom
at
the
close
of
the
seven
years
war
had
fallen
the
louisiana
territory
stretching
from
new
orleans
to
the
rocky
mountains
while
he
controlled
the
mouth
of
the
mississippi
there
was
little
to
fear
for
he
had
neither
the
army
nor
the
navy
necessary
to
resist
any
invasion
of
american
trade
moreover
washington
had
been
able
by
the
exercise
of
great
tact
to
secure
from
spain
in  trading
privilege
through
new
orleans
which
satisfied
the
present
requirements
of
the
frontiersmen
even
if
it
did
not
allay
their
fears
for
the
future
so
things
stood
when  swift
succession
of
events
altered
the
whole
situation
louisiana
transferred
to
france
in
july  royal
order
from
spain
instructed
the
officials
at
new
orleans
to
close
the
port
to
american
produce
about
the
same
time  disturbing
rumor
long
current
was
confirmed
napoleon
had
coerced
spain
into
returning
louisiana
to
france
by  secret
treaty
signed
in
the
scalers
of
the
alps
and
conquerors
of
venice
now
looked
across
the
sea
for
new
scenes
of
adventure
the
west
was
ablaze
with
excitement  call
for
war
ran
through
the
frontier
expeditions
were
organized
to
prevent
the
landing
of
the
french
and
petitions
for
instant
action
flooded
in
upon
jefferson
jefferson
sees
the
danger
jefferson
the
friend
of
france
and
sworn
enemy
of
england
compelled
to
choose
in
the
interest
of
america
never
winced
the
cession
of
louisiana
and
the
floridas
by
spain
to
france
he
wrote
to
livingston
the
american
minister
in
paris
works
sorely
on
the
united
states
it
completely
reverses
all
the
political
relations
of
the
united
states
and
will
form  new
epoch
in
our
political
course
there
is
on
the
globe
one
single
spot
the
possessor
of
which
is
our
natural
and
habitual
enemy
it
is
new
orleans
through
which
the
produce
of
three
eighths
of
our
territory
must
pass
to
market
france
placing
herself
in
that
door
assumes
to
us
an
attitude
of
defiance
spain
might
have
retained
it
quietly
for
years
her
pacific
dispositions
her
feeble
state
would
induce
her
to
increase
our
facilities
there
not
so
can
it
ever
be
in
the
hands
of
france
the
day
that
france
takes
possession
of
new
orleans
fixes
the
sentence
which
is
to
restrain
her
forever
within
her
low
water
mark
it
seals
the
union
of
the
two
nations
who
in
conjunction
can
maintain
exclusive
possession
of
the
ocean
from
that
moment
we
must
marry
ourselves
to
the
british
fleet
and
nation
this
is
not  state
of
things
we
seek
or
desire
it
is
one
which
this
measure
if
adopted
by
france
forces
on
us
as
necessarily
as
any
other
cause
by
the
laws
of
nature
brings
on
its
necessary
effect
louisiana
purchased
acting
on
this
belief
but
apparently
seeing
only
the
mississippi
outlet
at
stake
jefferson
sent
his
friend
james
monroe
to
france
with
the
power
to
buy
new
orleans
and
west
florida
before
monroe
arrived
the
regular
minister
livingston
had
already
convinced
napoleon
that
it
would
be
well
to
sell
territory
which
might
be
wrested
from
him
at
any
moment
by
the
british
sea
power
especially
as
the
war
temporarily
stopped
by
the
peace
of
amiens
was
once
more
raging
in
europe
wise
as
he
was
in
his
day
livingston
had
at
first
no
thought
of
buying
the
whole
louisiana
country
he
was
simply
dazed
when
napoleon
offered
to
sell
the
entire
domain
and
get
rid
of
the
business
altogether
though
staggered
by
the
proposal
he
and
monroe
decided
to
accept
on
april
they
signed
the
treaty
of
cession
agreeing
to
pay
in
six
per
cent
bonds
and
to
discharge
certain
debts
due
french
citizens
making
in
all
approximately
fifteen
millions
spain
protested
napoleon  brother
fumed
french
newspapers
objected
but
the
deed
was
done
jefferson
and
his
constitutional
scruples
when
the
news
of
this
extraordinary
event
reached
the
united
states
the
people
were
filled
with
astonishment
and
no
one
was
more
surprised
than
jefferson
himself
he
had
thought
of
buying
new
orleans
and
west
florida
for  small
sum
and
now  vast
domain
had
been
dumped
into
the
lap
of
the
nation
he
was
puzzled
on
looking
into
the
constitution
he
found
not  line
authorizing
the
purchase
of
more
territory
and
so
he
drafted
an
amendment
declaring
louisiana
as
ceded
by
france  part
of
the
united
states
he
had
belabored
the
federalists
for
piling
up  big
national
debt
and
he
could
hardly
endure
the
thought
of
issuing
more
bonds
himself
in
the
midst
of
his
doubts
came
the
news
that
napoleon
might
withdraw
from
the
bargain
thoroughly
alarmed
by
that
jefferson
pressed
the
senate
for  ratification
of
the
treaty
he
still
clung
to
his
original
idea
that
the
constitution
did
not
warrant
the
purchase
but
he
lamely
concluded
if
our
friends
shall
think
differently  shall
certainly
acquiesce
with
satisfaction
confident
that
the
good
sense
of
our
country
will
correct
the
evil
of
construction
when
it
shall
produce
ill
effects
thus
the
stanch
advocate
of
strict
interpretation
cut
loose
from
his
own
doctrine
and
intrusted
the
construction
of
the
constitution
to
the
good

great
britain
countered
with  still
more
irritating
decree
the
orders
in

it
modified
its

in
so
doing
merely
authorized
american

to
complete
their
voyage
to
the

on
condition
of
their
stopping
at  british
port

and
paying  tax
this
responded
napoleon
was
the
height
of
insolence
and
he
denounced
it
as  gross
violation
of
international
law
he
then
closed
the
circle
of
american
troubles
by
issuing
his
milan
decree
of
december
this
order
declared
that
any
ship
which
complied
with
the
british
rules
would
be
subject
to
seizure
and
confiscation

french
authorities
the
impressment
of
seamen
that
was
not
all
great
britain
in
dire
need
of
men
for
her
navy
adopted
the
practice
of
stopping
american
ships
searching
them
and
carrying
away
british
born
sailors
found
on
board
british
sailors
were
so
badly
treated
so
cruelly
flogged
for
trivial
causes
and
so
meanly
fed
that
they
fled
in
crowds
to
the
american
marine
in
many
cases
it
was
difficult
to
tell
whether
seamen
were
english
or
american
they
spoke
the
same
language
so
that
language
was
no
test
rovers
on
the
deep
and
stragglers
in
the
ports
of
both
countries
they
frequently
had
no
papers
to
show
their
nativity
moreover
great
britain
held
to
the
old
rule
once
an
englishman
always
an
englishman  doctrine
rejected
by
the
united
states
in
favor
of
the
principle
that  man
could
choose
the
nation
to
which
he
would
give
allegiance
british
sea
captains
sometimes
by
mistake
and
often
enough
with
reckless
indifference
carried
away
into
servitude
in
their
own
navy
genuine
american
citizens
the
process
itself
even
when
executed
with
all
the
civilities
of
law
was
painful
enough
for
it
meant
that
american
ships
were
forced
to
come
to
and
compelled
to
rest
submissively
under
british
guns
until
the
searching
party
had
pried
into
records
questioned
seamen
seized
and
handcuffed
victims
saints
could
not
have
done
this
work
without
raising
angry
passions
and
only
saints
could
have
endured
it
with
patience
and
fortitude
had
the
enactment
of
the
scenes
been
confined
to
the
high
seas
and
knowledge
of
them
to
rumors
and
newspaper
stories
american
resentment
might
not
have
been
so
intense
but
many  search
and
seizure
was
made
in
sight
of
land
british
and
french
vessels
patrolled
the
coasts
firing
on
one
another
and
chasing
one
another
in

waters

to
be
deserters

eighteen
more
an
act
which
even
the
british
ministry
could
hardly
excuse
if
the
french
were
less
frequently
the
offenders
it
was
not
because
of
their
tenderness
about
american
rights
but
because
so
few
of
their

escaped
the
hawk
eyed

operate
in

waters
the
losses
in

commerce
this
high
handed
conduct
on
the
part
of

belligerents
was
very
injurious
to
american
trade
by
their
enterprise
american
shippers
had
become
the
foremost
carriers
on
the
atlantic
ocean
in  decade
they
had
doubled
the
tonnage
of

merchant
ships
under

almost

were

to
be
captured
by

which
in

of

ranged

american
ships
destined
for

if
they
failed
to
stop
at

were
in
great
danger
of

on
both

was
impossible

the

in

adopted
in

the

france

cutting

the
result
of
the

was
pathetic
england

american

lured
by
huge

had
formerly
been

office
was
like

madison
had
been  leader
since
the
days
of

in
legislative
halls
and
council
chambers
not
on
the
field
of

small
in

sensitive
in

studious
in

was
now
as

called
upon
to
apply
in
one
of
the
most
perplexing
moments
in
all
american
history
in
keeping
with
his
own
traditions
and
following
in
the
footsteps
of
jefferson
he
vainly
tried
to
solve
the
foreign
problem
by
negotiation
the
trend
of
events
whatever
difficulties
madison
had
in
making
up
his
mind
on
war
and
peace
were
settled
by
events
beyond
his
own
control
in
the
spring
of  british
frigate
held
up
an
american
ship
near
the
harbor
of
new
york
and
impressed  seaman
alleged
to
be
an
american
citizen
burning
with
resentment
the
captain
of
the
president
an
american
warship
acting
under
orders
poured
several
broadsides
into
the
little
belt  british
sloop
suspected
of
being
the
guilty
party
the
british
also
encouraged
the
indian
chief
tecumseh
who
welded
together
the
indians
of
the
northwest
under
british
protection
and
gave
signs
of
restlessness
presaging  revolt
this
sent  note
of
alarm
along
the
frontier
that
was
not
checked
even
when
in
november
tecumseh  men
were
badly
beaten
at
tippecanoe
by
william
henry
harrison
the
indians
stood
in
the
way
of
the
advancing
frontier
and
it
seemed
to
the
pioneers
that
without
support
from
the
british
in
canada
the
red
men
would
soon
be
subdued
clay
and
calhoun
while
events
were
moving
swiftly
and
rumors
were
flying
thick
and
fast
the
mastery
of
the
government
passed
from
the
uncertain
hands
of
madison
to  party
of
ardent
young
men
in
congress
dubbed
young
republicans
under
the
leadership
of
two
members
destined
to
be
mighty
figures
in
american
history
henry
clay
of
kentucky
and
john  calhoun
of
south
carolina
the
former
contended
in  flair
of
folly
that
the
militia
of
kentucky
alone
are
competent
to
place
montreal
and
upper
canada
at
your
feet
the
latter
with  light
heart
spoke
of
conquering
canada
in  four
weeks
campaign
it
must
not
be
inferred
says
channing
that
in
advocating
conquest
the
westerners
were
actuated
merely
by
desire
for
land
they
welcomed
war
because
they
thought
it
would
be
the
easiest
way
to
abate
indian
troubles
the
savages
were
supported
by
the
fur
trading
interests
that
centred
at
quebec
and
london
the
southerners
on
their
part
wished
for
florida
and
they
thought
that
the
conquest
of
canada
would
obviate
some
northern
opposition
to
this
acquisition
of
slave
territory
while
clay
and
calhoun
spokesmen
of
the
west
and
south
were
not
unmindful
of
what
napoleon
had
done
to
american
commerce
they
knew
that
their
followers
still
remembered
with
deep
gratitude
the
aid
of
the
french
in
the
war
for
independence
and
that
the
embers
of
the
old
hatred
for
george
iii
still
on
the
throne
could
be
readily
blown
into
flame
madison
accepts
war
as
inevitable
the
conduct
of
the
british
ministers
with
whom
madison
had
to
deal
did
little
to
encourage
him
in
adhering
to
the
policy
of
watchful
waiting
one
of
them  high
tory
believed
that
all
americans
were
alike
except
that  few
are
less
knaves
than
others
and
his
methods
were
colored
by
his
belief
on
the
recall
of
this
minister
the
british
government
selected
another
no
less
high
and
mighty
in
his
principles
and
opinions
so
madison
became
thoroughly
discouraged
about
the
outcome
of
pacific
measures
when
the
pressure
from
congress
upon
him
became
too
heavy
he
gave
way
signing
on
june
the
declaration
of
war
on
great
britain
in
proclaiming
hostilities
the
administration
set
forth
the
causes
which
justified
the
declaration
namely
the
british
had
been
encouraging
the
indians
to
attack
american
citizens
on
the
frontier
they
had
ruined
american
trade
by
blockades
they
had
insulted
the
american
flag
by
stopping
and
searching
our
ships
they
had
illegally
seized
american
sailors
and
driven
them
into
the
british
navy
the
course
of
the
war
the
war
lasted
for
nearly
three
years
without
bringing
victory
to
either
side
the
surrender
of
detroit
by
general
hull
to
the
british
and
the
failure
of
the
american
invasion
of
canada
were
offset
by
perry  victory
on
lake
erie
and  decisive
blow
administered
to
british
designs
for
an
invasion
of
new
york
by
way
of
plattsburgh
the
triumph
of
jackson
at
new
orleans
helped
to
atone
for
the
humiliation
suffered
in
the
burning
of
the
capitol
by
the
british
the
stirring
deeds
of
the
constitution
the
united
states
and
the
argus
on
the
seas
the
heroic
death
of
lawrence
and
the
victories
of  hundred
privateers
furnished
consolation
for
those
who
suffered
from
the
iron
blockade
finally
established
by
the
british
government
when
it
came
to
appreciate
the
gravity
of
the
situation
while
men
love
the
annals
of
the
sea
they
will
turn
to
the
running
battles
the
narrow
escapes
and
the
reckless
daring
of
american
sailors
in
that
naval
contest

all
this

it
was
inconclusive
in

never
was  government
less
prepared
than
was
that
of
the

in
it
had
neither
the

great

harassed

embarrassed
by
nearly
twenty
years
of

england
was

to
settle
with

as
that
could
be
done
without
conceding
anything
or
surrendering
any
claims
the
treaty
of
peace
both
countries
were
in
truth
sick
of  war
that
offered
neither
glory
nor
profit
having
indulged
in
the
usual
diplomatic
skirmishing
they
sent
representatives
to

after
long
negotiations
an
agreement
was
reached
on
christmas
eve  few
days
before
jackson  victory
at
new
orleans
when
the
treaty
reached
america
the
people
were
surprised
to
find
that
it
said
nothing
about
the
seizure
of
american
sailors
the
destruction
of
american
trade
the
searching
of
american
ships
or
the
support
of
indians
on

frontier
nevertheless
we
are
told
the
people
passed
from
gloom
to
glory
when
the
news
of
peace
arrived
the
bells
were
rung
schools
were
closed
flags
were
displayed
and
many  rousing
toast
was
drunk
in
tavern
and
private
home
the
rejoicing
could
continue

which
meant
the
completion
of
the
ruin
already
begun
in
the
course
of
the
struggle
the
federalist
leaders
came
perilously
near
to
treason
in
their
efforts
to
hamper
the
government
of
the
united

and
in
their
desperation
they
fell
back
upon
the

them

the
counsels
of

were

but
the
convention
solemnly
went
on
record
to
the
effect
that
acts
of
congress
in
violation
of
the
constitution
are
void
that
in
cases
of
deliberate
dangerous
and
palpable
infractions
the
state
is
duty
bound
to
interpose
its
authority
for
the
protection
of

that
when

occur
the

must
be
their

thus
new

answered
the
challenge
of
calhoun
and
clay
fortunately
its
actions
were
not
as
rash
as
its
words
the

merely
proposed
certain

hopelessly
discredited

lost
all
their

taint
of
provincialism
moreover
in
turning
to
measures
of
reconstruction
called
forth
by

they
resorted

calhoun
dismissed
the
vexed
question
of

with  scant
reference
to
an
ancient
dispute

set

clay

calhoun
defended
it
on
national
principles
for
this
sudden
reversal
of
policy
the
young
republicans
were
taunted
by
some
of
their
older
party
colleagues
with
betraying
the
agricultural
interest
that
jefferson
had
fostered
but
calhoun
refused
to
listen
to
their
criticisms

are

he
said

fell
two
tasks
of
national
importance
adding
to
the
prestige
of
the
whole
country
and
deepening
the
sense
of
patriotism
that
weaned
men
away
from
mere
allegiance
to
states
the
first
of
these
was
the
purchase
of

from
spain
the
acquisition
of
louisiana
let
the
mississippi
flow
unvexed
to
the
sea
but
it
left
all
the
states
east
of
the
river
cut
off
from
the
gulf
affording
them
ground
for
discontent
akin
to
that
which
had
moved
the
pioneers
of

were  basis
for

marauders
who
periodically
swept
into
the
frontier
settlements
and
hiding
places
for
runaway
slaves
thus
the
sanction
of
international
law
was
given
to
punitive
expeditions
into
alien
territory
the
pioneer
leaders
stood
waiting
for
the
signal
it
came
president
monroe
on
the
occasion
of
an
indian
outbreak
ordered
general
jackson
to
seize
the
offenders
in
the
floridas
if
necessary
the
high
spirited
warrior
taking
this
as  hint
that
he
was
to
occupy
the
coveted
region
replied
that
if
possession
was
the
object
of
the
invasion
he
could
occupy
the
floridas
within
sixty
days
without
waiting
for
an
answer
to
this
letter
he
launched
his
expedition
and
in
the
spring
of
was
master
of
the
spanish
king  domain
to
the
south
there
was
nothing
for
the
king
to
do
but
to
make
the
best
of
the
inevitable
by
ceding
the
floridas
to
the
united
states
in
return
for
five
million
dollars
to
be
paid
to
american
citizens
having
claims
against
spain
on
washington  birthday
the
treaty
was
signed
it
ceded
the
floridas
to
the
united
states
and
defined
the
boundary
between
mexico
and
the
united
states
by
drawing  line
from
the
mouth
of
the
sabine
river
in  northwesterly
direction
to
the
pacific
on
this
occasion
even
monroe
former
opponent
of
the
constitution
forgot
to
inquire
whether
new
territory
could
be
constitutionally
acquired
and
incorporated
into
the
american
union
the
republicans
seemed
far
away
from
the
days
of
strict
construction
and
jefferson
still
lived
the
monroe
doctrine
even
more
effective
in
fashioning
the
national
idea
was
monroe  enunciation
of
the
famous
doctrine
that
bears
his
name
the
occasion
was
another
european
crisis
during
the
napoleonic
upheaval
and
the
years
of
dissolution
that
ensued
the
spanish
colonies
in
america
following
the
example
set
by
their
english
neighbors
in
declared
their
independence
unable
to
conquer
them
alone
the
king
of
spain
turned
for
help
to
the
friendly
powers
of
europe
that
looked
upon
revolution
and
republics
with
undisguised
horror
the
holy
alliance
he
found
them
prepared
to
view
his
case
with
sympathy
three
of
them
austria
prussia
and
russia
under
the
leadership
of
the
czar
alexander  in
the
autumn
of
had
entered
into  holy
alliance
to
sustain
by
reciprocal
service
the
autocratic
principle
in
government
although
the
effusive
almost
maudlin
language
of
the
treaty
did
not
express
their
purpose
explicitly
the
alliance
was
later
regarded
as  mere
union
of
monarchs
to
prevent
the
rise
and
growth
of
popular
government
the
american
people
thought
their
worst
fears
confirmed
when
in  conference
of
delegates
from
russia
austria
prussia
and
france
met
at
verona
to
consider
among
other
things
revolutions
that
had
just
broken
out
in
spain
and
italy
the
spirit
of
the
conference
is
reflected
in
the
first
article
of
the
agreement
reached
by
the
delegates
the
high
contracting
powers
being
convinced
that
the
system
of
representative
government
is
equally
incompatible
with
the
monarchical
principle
and
the
maxim
of
the
sovereignty
of
the
people
with
the
divine
right
mutually
engage
in
the
most
solemn
manner
to
use
all
their
efforts
to
put
an
end
to
the
system
of
representative
government
in
whatever
country
it
may
exist
in
europe
and
to
prevent
its
being
introduced
in
those
countries
where
it
is
not
yet
known
the
czar
who
incidentally
coveted
the
west
coast
of
north
america
proposed
to
send
an
army
to
aid
the
king
of
spain
in
his
troubles
at
home
thus
preparing
the
way
for
intervention
in
spanish
america
it
was
material
weakness
not
want
of
spirit
that
prevented
the
grand
union
of
monarchs
from
making
open
war
on
popular
government
the
position
of
england
unfortunately
too
for
the
holy
alliance
england
refused
to
cooperate
english
merchants
had
built
up  large
trade
with
the
independent
latin
american
colonies
and
they
protested
against
the
restoration
of
spanish
sovereignty
which
meant  renewal
of
spain  former
trade
monopoly
moreover
divine
right
doctrines
had
been
laid
to
rest
in
england
and
the
representative
principle
thoroughly
established
already
there
were
signs
of
the
coming
democratic
flood
which
was
soon
to
carry
the
first
reform
bill
of
extending
the
suffrage
and
sweep
on
to
even
greater
achievements
british
statesmen
therefore
had
to
be
cautious
in
such
circumstances
instead
of
cooperating
with
the
autocrats
of
russia
austria
and
prussia
they
turned
to
the
minister
of
the
united
states
in
london
the
british
prime
minister
canning
proposed
that
the
two
countries
join
in
declaring
their
unwillingness
to
see
the
spanish
colonies
transferred
to
any
other
power
jefferson  advice
the
proposal
was
rejected
but
president
monroe
took
up
the
suggestion
with
madison
and
jefferson
as
well
as
with
his
secretary
of
state
john
quincy
adams
they
favored
the
plan
jefferson
said
one
nation
most
of
all
could
disturb
us
in
this
pursuit
of
freedom
she
now
offers
to
lead
aid
and
accompany
us
in
it
by
acceding
to
her
proposition
we
detach
her
from
the
bands
bring
her
mighty
weight
into
the
scale
of
free
government
and
emancipate  continent
at
one
stroke
with
her
on
our
side
we
need
not
fear
the
whole
world
with
her
then
we
should
most
sedulously
cherish  cordial
friendship
monroe  statement
of
the
doctrine
acting
on
the
advice
of
trusted
friends
president
monroe
embodied
in
his
message
to
congress
on
december  statement
of
principles
now
famous
throughout
the
world
as
the
monroe
doctrine
to
the
autocrats
of
europe
he
announced
that
he
would
regard
any
attempt
on
their
part
to
extend
their
system
to
any
portion
of
this
hemisphere
as
dangerous
to
our
peace
and
safety
while
he
did
not
propose
to
interfere
with
existing
colonies
dependent
on
european
powers
he
ranged
himself
squarely
on
the
side
of
those
that
had
declared
their
independence
any
attempt
by  european
power
to
oppress
them
or
control
their
destiny
in
any
manner
he
characterized
as  manifestation
of
an
unfriendly
disposition
toward
the
united
states
referring
in
another
part
of
his
message
to  recent
claim
which
the
czar
had
made
to
the
pacific
coast
president
monroe
warned
the
old
world
that
the
american
continents
by
the
free
and
independent
condition
which
they
have
assumed
and
maintained
are
henceforth
not
to
be
considered
as
subjects
for
future
colonization
by
any
european
powers
the
effect
of
this
declaration
was
immediate
and
profound
men
whose
political
horizon
had
been
limited
to  community
or
state
were
led
to
consider
their
nation
as  great
power
among
the
sovereignties
of
the
earth
taking
its
part
in
shaping
their
international
relations
the
missouri
compromise
respecting
one
other
important
measure
of
this
period
the
republicans
also
took  broad
view
of
their
obligations
under
the
constitution
namely
the
missouri
compromise
it
is
true
they
insisted
on
the
admission
of
missouri
as  slave
state
balanced
against
the
free
state
of
maine
but
at
the
same
time
they
assented
to
the
prohibition
of
slavery
in
the
louisiana
territory
north
of
the
line  during
the
debate
on
the
subject
an
extreme
view
had
been
presented
to
the
effect
that
congress
had
no
constitutional
warrant
for
abolishing
slavery
in
the
territories
the
precedent
of
the
northwest
ordinance
ratified
by
congress
in
seemed  conclusive
answer
from
practice
to
this
contention
but
monroe
submitted
the
issue
to
his
cabinet
which
included
calhoun
of
south
carolina
crawford
of
georgia
and
wirt
of
virginia
all
presumably
adherents
to
the
jeffersonian
principle
of
strict
construction
he
received
in
reply  unanimous
verdict
to
the
effect
that
congress
did
have
the
power
to
prohibit
slavery
in
the
territories
governed
by
it
acting
on
this
advice
he
approved
on
march
the
bill
establishing
freedom
north
of
the
compromise
line
this
generous
interpretation
of
the
powers
of
congress
stood
for
nearly
forty
years
until
repudiated
by
the
supreme
court
in
the
dred

case
the

of

as

of
the

from

lost
no
occasion
to
exalt

above
the
claims
of
the
provinces
no
differences
of
opinion
as
to
his
political
views
have
ever
led
even
his
warmest
opponents
to
deny
his
superb
abilities
or
his
sincere
devotion
to
the
national
idea
all
will
likewise
agree
that
for
talents
native
and
acquired
he
was
an
ornament
to
the
humble
democracy
that
brought
him
forth
his
whole
career
was
american
born
on
the
frontier
of
virginia
reared
in  log
cabin
granted
only
the
barest
rudiments
of
education
inured
to
hardship
and
rough
life
he
rose
by
masterly
efforts
to
the
highest
judicial
honor
america
can
bestow
on
him
the
bitter
experience
of
the
revolution
and
of
later
days
made  lasting
impression
he
was
no
summer
patriot
he
had
been  soldier
in
the
revolutionary
army
he
had
suffered
with
washington
at
valley
forge
he
had
seen
his
comrades
in
arms
starving
and
freezing
because
the
continental
congress
had
neither
the
power
nor
the
inclination
to
force
the
states
to
do
their
full
duty
to
him
the
articles
of
confederation
were
the
symbol
of
futility
into
the
struggle
for
the

he
had
thrown
himself
with
the
ardor
of  soldier
later
as  member
of
congress  representative
to
france
and
secretary
of
state
he
had
aided
the
federalists
in
establishing
the
new
government
when
at
length
they
were
driven
from
power
in
the
executive
and
legislative
branches
of
the
government
he
was
chosen
for
their
last
stronghold
the
supreme
court
by
historic
irony
he
administered
the
oath
of
office
to
his
bitterest
enemy
thomas
jefferson
and
long
after
the
author
of
the
declaration
of
independence
had
retired
to
private
life
the
stern
chief
justice
continued
to
announce
the
old
federalist
principles
from
the
supreme
bench
illustration
john
marshall
marbury
vs
madison
an
act
of
congress
annulled
he
had
been
in
his
high
office
only
two
years
when
he
laid
down
for
the
first
time
in
the
name
of
the
entire
court
the
doctrine
that
the
judges
have
the
power
to
declare
an
act
of
congress
null
and
void
when
in
their
opinion
it
violates
the
constitution
this
power
was
not
expressly
conferred
on
the
court
though
many
able
men
held
that
the
judicial
branch
of
the
government
enjoyed
it
the
principle
was
not
positively
established
until
when
the
case
of
marbury
vs
madison
was
decided
in
rendering
the
opinion
of
the
court
marshall
cited
no
precedents
he
sought
no
foundations
for
his
argument
in
ancient
history
he
rested
it
on
the
general
nature
of
the
american
system
the
constitution
ran
his
reasoning
is
the
supreme
law
of
the
land
it
limits
and
binds
all
who
act
in
the
name
of
the
united
states
it
limits
the
powers
of
congress
and
defines
the
rights
of
citizens
if
congress
can
ignore
its
limitations
and
trespass
upon
the
rights
of
citizens
marshall
argued
then
the
constitution
disappears
and
congress
is
supreme
since
however
the
constitution
is
supreme
and
superior
to
congress
it
is
the
duty
of
judges
under
their
oath
of
office
to
sustain
it
against
measures
which
violate
it
therefore
from
the
nature
of
the
american
constitutional
system
the
courts
must
declare
null
and
void
all
acts
which
are
not
authorized  law
repugnant
to
the
constitution
he
closed
is
void
and
the
courts
as
well
as
other
departments
are
bound
by
that
instrument
from
that
day
to
this
the
practice
of
federal
and
state
courts
in
passing
upon
the
constitutionality
of
laws
has
remained
unshaken
this
doctrine
was
received
by
jefferson
and
many
of
his
followers
with
consternation
if
the
idea
was
sound
he
exclaimed
then
indeed
is
our
constitution  complete
felo
de
se
legally  suicide
for
intending
to
establish
three
departments
coordinate
and
independent
that
they
might
check
and
balance
one
another
it
has
given
according
to
this
opinion
to
one
of
them
alone
the
right
to
prescribe
rules
for
the
government
of
the
others
and
to
that
one
too
which
is
unelected
by
and
independent
of
the
nation
the
constitution
on
this
hypothesis
is  mere
thing
of
wax
in
the
hands
of
the
judiciary
which
they
may
twist
and
shape
into
any
form
they
please
it
should
be
remembered
as
an
axiom
of
eternal
truth
in
politics
that
whatever
power
in
any
government
is
independent
is
absolute
also  judiciary
independent
of  king
or
executive
alone
is  good
thing
but
independence
of
the
will
of
the
nation
is  solecism
at
least
in  republican
government
but
marshall
was
mighty
and
his
view
prevailed
though
from
time
to
time
other
men
clinging
to
jefferson  opinion
likewise
opposed
the
exercise
by
the
courts
of
the
high
power
of
passing
upon
the
constitutionality
of
acts
of
congress
acts
of
state
legislatures
declared
unconstitutional
had
marshall
stopped
with
annulling
an
act
of
congress
he
would
have
heard
less
criticism
from
republican
quarters
but
with
the
same
firmness
he
set
aside
acts
of
state
legislatures
as
well
whenever
in
his
opinion
they
violated
the
federal
constitution
in
in
the
case
of
fletcher
vs
peck
he
annulled
an
act
of
the
georgia
legislature
informing
the
state
that
it
was
not
sovereign
but  part
of  large
empire  member
of
the
american
union
and
that
union
has  constitution
which
imposes
limits
to
the
legislatures
of
the
several
states
in
the
case
of
mcculloch
vs
maryland
decided
in
he
declared
void
an
act
of
the
maryland
legislature
designed
to
paralyze
the
branches
of
the
united
states
bank
established
in
that
state
in
the
same
year
in
the
still
more
memorable
dartmouth
college
case
he
annulled
an
act
of
the
new
hampshire
legislature
which
infringed
upon
the
charter
received
by
the
college
from
king
george
long
before
that
charter
he
declared
was  contract
between
the
state
and
the
college
which
the
legislature
under
the
federal
constitution
could
not
impair
two
years
later
he
stirred
the
wrath
of
virginia
by
summoning
her
to
the
bar
of
the
supreme
court
to
answer
in  case
in
which
the
validity
of
one
of
her
laws
was
involved
and
then
justified
his
action
in  powerful
opinion
rendered
in
the
case
of
cohens
vs
virginia
all
these
decisions
aroused
the
legislatures
of
the
states
they
passed
sheaves
of
resolutions
protesting
and
condemning
but
marshall
never
turned
and
never
stayed
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
he
fairly
thundered
at
them
is
the
supreme
law
of
the
land
the
supreme
court
is
the
proper
tribunal
to
pass
finally
upon
the
validity
of
the
laws
of
the
states
and
those
sovereignties
far
from
possessing
the
right
of
review
and
nullification
are
irrevocably
bound
by
the
decisions
of
that
court
this
was
strong
medicine
for
the
authors
of
the
kentucky
and
virginia
resolutions
and
for
the
members
of
the
hartford
convention
but
they
had
to
take
it
the
doctrine
of
implied
powers
while
restraining
congress
in
the
marbury
case
and
the
state
legislatures
in  score
of
cases
marshall
also
laid
the
judicial
foundation
for  broad
and
liberal
view
of
the
constitution
as
opposed
to
narrow
and
strict
construction
in
mcculloch
vs
maryland
he
construed
generously
the
words
necessary
and
proper
in
such  way
as
to
confer
upon
congress  wide
range
of
implied
powers
in
addition
to
their
express
powers
that
case
involved
among
other
things
the
question
whether
the
act
establishing
the
second
united
states
bank
was
authorized
by
the
constitution
marshall
answered
in
the
affirmative
congress
ran
his
reasoning
has
large
powers
over
taxation
and
the
currency  bank
is
of
appropriate
use
in
the
exercise
of
these
enumerated
powers
and
therefore
though
not
absolutely
necessary  bank
is
entirely
proper
and
constitutional
with
respect
to
the
means
by
which
the
powers
that
the
constitution
confers
are
to
be
carried
into
execution
he
said
congress
must
be
allowed
the
discretion
which
will
enable
that
body
to
perform
the
high
duties
assigned
to
it
in
the
manner
most
beneficial
to
the
people
in
short
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
is
not  strait
jacket
but  flexible
instrument
vesting
in
congress
the
powers
necessary
to
meet
national
problems
as
they
arise
in
delivering
this
opinion
marshall
used
language
almost
identical
with
that
employed
by
lincoln
when
standing
on
the
battle
field
of  war
waged
to
preserve
the
nation
he
said
that  government
of
the
people
by
the
people
for
the

not

during
the
strenuous
period

and
the
advent

the
great

was
under

who
had
launched
it
all
the

had

james

the
chief
author
of

lived
until
this
age
therefore
was
the
age

it
saw
the
threatened
ruin
of
the

the
rise

the
apparent
triumph
of
the
national
spirit
over

the
new

had
hardly
been
started
in
before
its
troubles
began
the
government
could
not
raise
money
to
pay
its
debts
or
running
expenses
it
could
not
protect
american
commerce
and
manufactures
against
european
competition
it
could
not
stop
the
continual
issues
of
paper
money
by
the
states
it
could
not
intervene
to
put
down
domestic
uprisings
that
threatened
the
existence
of
the
state
governments
without
money
without
an
army
without
courts

the
union
under
the
articles
of

was
drifting
into
dissolution
patriots
who
had
risked
their
lives
for

began
to
talk
of
monarchy
again
washington
hamilton
and
madison
insisted
that  new
constitution
alone
could
save
america
from
disaster
by
dint
of
much
labor
the
friends
of  new
form
of
government
induced
the
congress
to
call  national
convention
to
take
into
account
the
state
of
america
in
may
it
assembled
at
philadelphia
and
for
months
it
debated
and
wrangled
over
plans
for  constitution
the
small
states
clamored
for
equal
rights
in
the
union
the
large
states
vowed
that
they
would
never
grant
it  spirit
of
conciliation
fair
play
and
compromise
saved
the
convention
from
breaking
up
in
addition
there
were
jealousies
between
the
planting
states
and
the
commercial
states
here
too
compromises
had
to
be
worked
out
some
of
the
delegates
feared
the
growth
of
democracy
and
others
cherished
it
these
factions
also
had
to
be
placated
at
last  plan
of
government
was
drafted
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
submitted
to
the
states
for
approval
only
after  long
and
acrimonious
debate
did
enough
states
ratify
the
instrument
to
put
it
into

on

hamilton
led
the
way
but
he
had
not
gone
far
before
he
encountered
opposition
he
found  formidable
antagonist
in
jefferson
in
time
two
political
parties
appeared
full
armed
upon
the
scene
the
federalists
and
the
republicans
for
ten
years
they
filled
the
country
with

debate
in
the
federalists
were
utterly
vanquished
by
the
republicans
with
jefferson
in
the
lead
by
their
proclamations
of
faith
the
republicans
favored
the
states
rather
than
the
new

but
in
practice
they
added
immensely
to
the
prestige
and
power
of
the
nation
they
purchased
louisiana

they
waged  war
for
commercial
independence
against

they

zeal

it

the

of

to

it
left
unsolved
many
problems
in
the
first
place
tribes
of
resentful
indians
in
the

region
even
though
british
support
was
withdrawn
at
last
had
to
be
reckoned
with
and
it
was
not
until
after
the
establishment
of
the
federal

that  well
equipped

could
be
provided
to
guarantee

of

twelve
years
later
in

place
virginia
connecticut
and
massachusetts
had
conflicting
claims
to
the
land
in
the
northwest
based
on
old
english
charters
and
indian
treaties
it
was
only
after  bitter
contest
that
the
states
reached
an
agreement
to
transfer
their
rights
to
the
government
of
the
united
states
virginia
executing
her
deed
of
cession
on
march
in
the

titles
to
lands
bought
by
individuals
remained
uncertain
in
the
absence
of
official
maps
and
records
to
meet
this
last
situation
congress
instituted  systematic
survey
of
the
ohio
country
laying
it
out
into
townships
sections
of
acres
each
and
quarter
sections
in
every
township
one
section
of
land
was
set
aside
for
the
support
of
public
schools
the
northwest
ordinance
the
final
problem
which
had
to
be
solved
before
settlement
on  large
scale
could
be
begun
was
that
of
governing
the
territory
pioneers
who
looked
with
hungry
eyes
on
the
fertile
valley
of
the
ohio
could
hardly
restrain
their
impatience
soldiers
of
the
revolution
who
had
been
paid
for
their
services
in
land
warrants
entitling
them
to
make
entries
in
the
west
called
for
action
congress
answered
by
passing
in
the
famous
northwest
ordinance
providing
for
temporary
territorial
government
to
be
followed
by
the
creation
of  popular
assembly
as
soon
as
there
were
five
thousand
free
males
in
any
district
eventual
admission
to
the
union
on
an
equal
footing
with
the
original
states
was
promised
to
the
new
territories
religious
freedom
was
guaranteed
the
safeguards
of
trial
by
jury
regular
judicial
procedure
and
habeas
corpus
were
established
in
order
that
the
methods
of
civilized
life
might
take
the
place
of
the
rough
and
ready
justice
of
lynch
law
during
the
course
of
the
debate
on
the
ordinance
congress
added
the
sixth
article
forbidding
slavery
and
involuntary
servitude
this
charter
of
the
northwest
so
well
planned
by
the
congress
under
the
articles
of
confederation
was
continued
in
force
by
the
first
congress
under
the
constitution
in
the
following
year
its
essential
provisions
except
the
ban
on
slavery
were
applied
to
the
territory
south
of
the
ohio
ceded
by
north
carolina
to
the
national
government
and
in
to
the
mississippi
territory
once
held
by
georgia
thus
it
was
settled
for
all
time
that
the
new
colonies
were
not
to
be
exploited
for
the
benefit
of
the
parent
states
any
more
than
for
the
benefit
of
england
but
were
to
be
autonomous
and
coordinate
commonwealths
this
outcome
bitterly
opposed
by
some
eastern
leaders
who
feared
the
triumph
of
western
states
over
the
seaboard
completed
the
legal
steps
necessary
by
way
of
preparation
for
the
flood
of
settlers
the
land
companies
speculators
and
western
land
tenure
as
in
the
original
settlement
of
america
so
in
the
opening
of
the
west
great
companies
and
single
proprietors
of
large
grants
early
figured
in
the
ohio
land
company  new
england
concern
acquired  million
and  half
acres
on
the
ohio
and
began
operations
by
planting
the
town
of
marietta  professional
land
speculator  c
symmes
secured  million
acres
lower
down
where
the
city
of
cincinnati
was
founded
other
individuals
bought
up
soldiers
claims
and
so
acquired
enormous
holdings
for
speculative
purposes
indeed
there
was
such  rush
to
make
fortunes
quickly
through
the
rise
in
land
values
that
washington
was
moved
to
cry
out
against
the
rage
for
speculating
in
and
forestalling
of
land
on
the
north
west
of
the
ohio
protesting
that
scarce  valuable
spot
within
any
tolerable
distance
of
it
is
left
without  claimant
he
therefore
urged
congress
to
fix  reasonable
price
for
the
land
not
too
exorbitant
and
burdensome
for
real
occupiers
but
high
enough
to
discourage
monopolizers
congress
however
was
not
prepared
to
use
the
public
domain
for
the
sole
purpose
of
developing  body
of
small
freeholders
in
the
west
it
still
looked
upon
the
sale
of
public
lands
as
an
important
source
of
revenue
with
which
to
pay
off
the
public
debt
consequently
it
thought
more
of
instant
income
than
of
ultimate
results
it
placed
no
limit
on
the
amount
which
could
be
bought
when
it
fixed
the
price
at
an
acre
in
and
it
encouraged
the
professional
land
operator
by
making
the
first
installment
only
twenty
cents
an
acre
in
addition
to
the
small
registration
and
survey
fee
on
such
terms  speculator
with  few
thousand
dollars
could
get
possession
of
an
enormous
plot
of
land
if
he
was
fortunate
in
disposing
of
it
he
could
meet
the
installments
which
were
spread
over  period
of
four
years
and
make  handsome
profit
for
himself
even
when
the
credit
or
installment
feature
was
abolished
in
and
the
price
of
the
land
lowered
to  cash
price
of
an
acre
the
opportunity
for
large
speculative
purchases
continued
to
attract
capital
to
land
ventures
the
development
of
the
small
freehold
the
cheapness
of
land
and
the
scarcity
of
labor
nevertheless
made
impossible
the
triumph
of
the
huge
estate
with
its
semi
servile
tenantry
for
about  man
could
get  farm
of
acres
on
the
installment
plan
another
payment
of
was
due
in
forty
days
but  four
year
term
was
allowed
for
the
discharge
of
the
balance
with  capital
of
from
two
to
three
hundred
dollars  family
could
embark
on  land
venture
if
it
had
good
crops
it
could
meet
the
deferred
payments
it
was
however  hard
battle
at
best
many  man
forfeited
his
land
through
failure
to
pay
the
final
installment
yet
in
the
end
in
spite
of
all
the
handicaps
the
small
freehold
of  few
hundred
acres
at
most
became
the
typical
unit
of
western
agriculture
except
in
the
planting
states
of
the
gulf
even
the
lands
of
the
great
companies
were
generally
broken
up
and
sold
in
small
lots
the
tendency
toward
moderate
holdings
so
favored
by
western
conditions
was
also
promoted
by  clause
in
the
northwest
ordinance
declaring
that
the
land
of
any
person
dying
intestate
that
is
without
any
will
disposing
of
it
should
be
divided
equally
among
his
descendants
hildreth
says
of
this
provision
it
established
the
important
republican
principle
not
then
introduced
into
all
the
states
of
the
equal
distribution
of
landed
as
well
as
personal
property
all
these
forces
combined
made
the
wide
dispersion
of
wealth
in
the
early
days
of
the
nineteenth
century
an
american
characteristic
in
marked
contrast
with
the
european
system
of
family
prestige
and
vast
estates
based
on
the
law
of
primogeniture
the
western
migration
and
new
states
the
people
with
government
established
federal
arms
victorious
over
the
indians
and
the
lands
surveyed
for
sale
the
way
was
prepared
for
the
immigrants
they
came
with  rush
young
new
englanders
weary
of
tilling
the
stony
soil
of
their
native
states
poured
through
new
york
and
pennsylvania
some
settling
on
the
northern
bank
of
the
ohio
but
most
of
them
in
the
lake
region
sons
and
daughters
of
german
farmers
in
pennsylvania
and
many  redemptioner
who
had
discharged
his
bond
of
servitude
pressed
out
into
ohio
kentucky
tennessee
or
beyond
from
the
exhausted
fields
and
the
clay
hills
of
the
southern
states
came
pioneers
of
english
and
scotch
irish
descent
the
latter
in
great
numbers
indeed
one
historian
of
high
authority
has
ventured
to
say
that
the
rapid
expansion
of
the
united
states
from  coast
strip
to  continental
area
is
largely  scotch
irish
achievement
while
native
americans
of
mixed
stocks
led
the
way
into
the
west
it
was
not
long
before
immigrants
direct
from
europe
under
the
stimulus
of
company
enterprise
began
to
filter
into
the
new
settlements
in
increasing
numbers
the
types
of
people
were
as
various
as
the
nations
they
represented
timothy
flint
who
published
his
entertaining
recollections
in
found
the
west  strange
mixture
of
all
sorts
and
conditions
of
people
some
of
them
he
relates
had
been
hunters
in
the
upper
world
of
the
mississippi
above
the
falls
of
st
anthony
some
had
been
still
farther
north
in
canada
still
others
had
wandered
from
the
south
the

of
mexico
the
red
river
and
the
spanish
country
french
boatmen
and
trappers
spanish
traders
from
the
southwest
virginia
planters
with
their
droves
of
slaves
mingled
with
english
german
and
scotch
irish
farmers
hunters
forest
rangers
restless
bordermen
and
squatters
like
the
foaming
combers
of
an
advancing
tide
went
first
then
followed
the
farmers
masters
of
the
ax
and
plow
with
their
wives
who
shared
every
burden
and
hardship
and
introduced
some
of
the
features
of
civilized
life
the
hunters
and
rangers
passed
on
to
new
scenes
the
home
makers
built
for
all
time
the
number
of
immigrants
there
were
no
official
stations
on
the
frontier
to
record
the
number
of
immigrants
who
entered
the
west
during
the
decades
following
the
american
revolution
but
travelers
of
the
time
record
that
every
road
was
crowded
with
pioneers
and
their
families
their
wagons
and
cattle
and
that
they
were
seldom
out
of
the
sound
of
the
snapping
whip
of
the
teamster
urging
forward
his
horses
or
the
crack
of
the
hunter  rifle
as
he
brought
down
his
evening
meal
during
the
latter
half
of
says
coman
more
than
nine
hundred
boats
floated
down
the
ohio
carrying
eighteen
thousand
men
women
and
children
and
twelve
thousand
horses
sheep
and
cattle
and
six
hundred
and
fifty
wagons
other
lines
of
travel
were
also
crowded
and
with
the
passing
years
the
flooding
tide
of
home
seekers
rose
higher
and
higher
the
western
routes
four
main
routes
led
into
the
country
beyond
the
appalachians
the
genesee
road
beginning
at
albany
ran
almost
due
west
to
the
present
site
of
buffalo
on
lake
erie
through  level
country
in
the
dry
season
wagons
laden
with
goods
could
easily
pass
along
it
into
northern
ohio  second
route
through
pittsburgh
was
fed
by
three
eastern
branches
one
starting
at
philadelphia
one
at
baltimore
and
another
at
alexandria  third
main
route
wound
through
the
mountains
from
alexandria
to
boonesboro
in
kentucky
and
then
westward
across
the
ohio
to
st
louis  fourth
the
most
famous
of
them
all
passed
through
the
cumberland
gap
and
by
branches
extended
into
the
cumberland
valley
and
the
kentucky
country
of
these
four
lines
of
travel
the
pittsburgh
route
offered
the
most
advantages
pioneers
no
matter
from
what
section
they
came
when
once
they
were
on
the
headwaters
of
the
ohio
and
in
possession
of  flatboat
could
find  quick
and
easy
passage
into
all
parts
of
the
west
and
southwest
whether
they
wanted
to
settle
in
ohio
kentucky
or
western
tennessee
they
could
find
their
way
down
the
drifting
flood
to
their
destination
or
at
least
to
some
spot
near
it
many
people
from
the
south
as
well
as
the
northern
and
middle
states
chose
this
route
so
it
came
about
that
the
sons
and
daughters
of
virginia
and
the
carolinas
mingled
with
those
of
new
york
pennsylvania
and
new
england
in

stories
giving

of

into

early
days

country
was
hardly
opened
before
visitors
from
the
old
world
and
from
the
eastern
states
impelled
by
curiosity
made
their
way
to
the
very
frontier
of
civilization
and
wrote
books
to
inform
or
amuse
the
public
one
of
them
gilbert
imlay
an
english
traveler
has
given
us
an
account
of
the
pittsburgh
route
as
he
found
it
in
if  man
he
writes
has  family
or
goods
of
any
sort
to
remove
his
best
way
then
would
be
to
purchase  waggon
and
team
of
horses
to
carry
his
property
to
redstone
old
fort
or
to
pittsburgh
according
as
he
may
come
from
the
northern
or
southern
states  good
waggon
will
cost
at
philadelphia
about
and
the
horses
about
each
they
would
cost
something
more
both
at
baltimore
and
alexandria
the
waggon
may
be
covered
with
canvass
and
if
it
is
the
choice
of
the
people
they
may
sleep
in
it
of
nights
with
the
greatest
safety
but
if
they
dislike
that
there
are
inns
of
accommodation
the
whole
distance
on
the
different
roads
the
provisions  would
purchase
in
the
same
manner
that
is
from
the
farmers
along
the
road
and
by
having
two
or
three
camp
kettles
and
stopping
every
evening
when
the
weather
is
fine
upon
the
brink
of
some
rivulet
and
by
kindling  fire
they
may
soon
dress
their
own
food
this
manner
of
journeying
is
so
far
from
being
disagreeable
that
in  fine
season
it
is
extremely
pleasant
the
immigrant
once
at
pittsburgh
or

resented

the
little

declared
that

undoubted
right
to

there
to
form
their
constitution

that
from

not

to
forbid

this
grand
convention
was
never

jacksonian

the
new
england
federalists
at
the
hartford
convention
prophesied
that
in
time
the
west
would
dominate
the
east
at
the
adoption
of
the
constitution
they
said  certain
balance
of
power
among
the
original
states
was
considered
to
exist
and
there
was
at
that
time
and
yet
is
among
those
parties  strong
affinity
between
their
great
and
general
interests
by
the
admission
of
these
new
states
that
balance
has
been
materially
affected
and
unless
the
practice
be
modified
must
ultimately
be
destroyed
the
southern
states
will
first
avail
themselves
of
their
new
confederates
to
govern
the
east
and
finally
the
western
states
multiplied
in
number
and
augmented
in
population
will
control
the
interests
of
the
whole
strangely
enough
the
fulfillment
of
this
prophecy
was
being
prepared
even
in
federalist
strongholds
by
the
rise
of  new
urban
democracy
that
was
to
make
common
cause
with
the
farmers
beyond
the
mountains
the
democratic
movement
in
the
east
the
aristocratic
features
of
the
old
order
the
revolutionary
fathers
in
setting
up
their
first
state
constitutions
although
they
often
spoke
of
government
as
founded
on
the
consent
of
the
governed
did
not
think
that
consistency
required
giving
the
vote
to
all
adult
males
on
the
contrary
they
looked
upon
property
owners
as
the
only
safe
depositary
of
political
power
they
went
back
to
the
colonial
tradition
that
related
taxation
and
representation
this
they
argued
was
not
only
just
but  safeguard
against
the
excesses
of
democracy
in
carrying
their
theory
into
execution
they
placed
taxpaying
or
property
qualifications
on
the
right
to
vote
broadly
speaking
these
limitations
fell
into
three
classes
three
states
pennsylvania
new
hampshire
and
georgia
gave
the
ballot
to
all
who
paid
taxes
without
reference
to
the
value
of
their
property
three
virginia
delaware
and
rhode
island
clung
firmly
to
the
ancient
principles
that
only
freeholders
could
be
intrusted
with
electoral
rights
still
other
states
while
closely
restricting
the
suffrage
accepted
the
ownership
of
other
things
as
well
as
land
in
fulfillment
of
the
requirements
in
massachusetts
for
instance
the
vote
was
granted
to
all
men
who
held
land
yielding
an
annual
income
of
three
pounds
or
possessed
other
property
worth
sixty
pounds
the
electors
thus
enfranchised
numerous
as
they
were
owing
to
the
wide
distribution
of
land
often
suffered
from  very
onerous
disability
in
many
states
they
were
able
to
vote
only
for
persons
of
wealth
because
heavy
property
qualifications
were
imposed
on
public
officers
in

were

of
the
states
the
suffrage

office
holding
or
both
were
further
restricted
by
religious
provisions
no
single
sect
was
powerful
enough
to
dominate
after
the
revolution
but
for
the
most
part
catholics
and
jews
were
either
disfranchised
or
excluded
from
office
north
carolina
and
georgia
denied
the
ballot
to
any
one
who
was
not  protestant
delaware
withheld
it
from
all
who
did
not
believe
in
the

not
be

property
qualifications
were
thoughtlessly
imposed
at
the
outset
or
considered
of
little
consequence
in

in
the
beginning
they
were
viewed
as
fundamental
as

grew

the
number
of

increased

were

of

it
is
entirely
just
that

jefferson
himself
had
first
believed
in
property
qualifications
and
had
feared
with
genuine
alarm
the
mobs
of
the
great
cities
it
was
near
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
century
before
he
accepted
the
idea
of
manhood
suffrage
even
then
he
was
unable
to
convince
the
constitution
makers
of
his
own
state
it
is
not
an
idle
chimera
of
the
brain
urged
one
of
them
that
the
possession
of
land
furnishes
the
strongest
evidence
of
permanent
common
interest
with
and
attachment
to
the
community
it
is
upon
this
foundation  wish
to
place
the
right
of
suffrage
this
is
the
best
general
standard
which
can
be
resorted
to
for
the
purpose
of
determining
whether
the
persons
to
be
invested
with
the
right
of
suffrage
are
such
persons
as
could
be
consistently
with
the
safety
and
well
being
of
the
community
intrusted
with
the
exercise
of
that
right
attacks
on
the
restricted
suffrage
the
changing
circumstances
of
american
life
however
soon
challenged
the
rule
of
those
with
property
prominent
among
the
new
forces
were
the
rising
mercantile
and
business
interests
where
the
freehold
qualification
was
applied
business
men
who
did
not
own
land
were
deprived
of
the
vote
and
excluded
from
office
in
new
york
for
example
the
most
illiterate
farmer
who
had
one
hundred
pounds
worth
of
land
could
vote
for
state
senator
and
governor
while
the
landless
banker
or
merchant
could
not
it
is
not
surprising
therefore
to
find
business
men
taking
the
lead
in
breaking
down
freehold
limitations
on
the
suffrage
the
professional
classes
also
were
interested
in
removing
the
barriers
which
excluded
many
of
them
from
public
affairs
it
was  schoolmaster
thomas
dorr
who
led
the
popular
uprising
in
rhode
island
which
brought
the
exclusive
rule
by
freeholders
to
an
end
in
addition
to
the
business
and
professional
classes
the
mechanics
of
the
towns
showed  growing
hostility
to  system
of
government
that
generally
barred
them
from
voting
or
holding
office
though
not
numerous
they
had
early
begun
to
exercise
an
influence
on
the
course
of
public
affairs
they
had
led
the
riots
against
the
stamp
act
overturned
king
george  statue
and
crammed
stamps
down
the
throats
of
collectors
when
the
state
constitutions
were
framed
they
took  lively
interest
particularly
in
new
york
city
and
philadelphia
in
june
the
mechanicks
in
union
in
new
york
protested
against
putting
the
new
state
constitution
into
effect
without
their
approval
declaring
that
the
right
to
vote
on
the
acceptance
or
rejection
of  fundamental
law
is
the
birthright
of
every
man
to
whatever
state
he
may
belong
though
their
petition
was
rejected
their
spirit
remained
when  few
years
later
the
federal
constitution
was
being
framed
the
mechanics
watched
the
process
with
deep
concern
they
knew
that
one
of
its
main
objects
was
to
promote
trade
and
commerce
affecting
directly
their
daily
bread
during
the
struggle
over
ratification
they
passed
resolutions
approving
its
provisions
and
they
often
joined
in
parades
organized
to
stir
up
sentiment
for
the
constitution
even
though
they
could
not
vote
for
members
of
the
state
conventions
and
so
express
their
will
directly
after
the
organization
of
trade
unions
they
collided
with
the
courts
of
law
and
thus
became
interested
in
the
election
of
judges
and
lawmakers
those
who
attacked
the
old
system
of
class
rule
found  strong
moral
support
in
the
declaration
of
independence
was
it
not
said
that
all
men
are
created
equal
whoever
runs
may
read
was
it
not
declared
that
governments
derive
their
just
power
from
the
consent
of
the
governed
that
doctrine
was
applied
with
effect
to
george
iii
and
seemed
appropriate
for
use
against
the
privileged
classes
of
massachusetts
or
virginia
how
do
the
principles
thus
proclaimed
asked
the
non
freeholders
of
richmond
in
petitioning
for
the
ballot
accord
with
the
existing
regulation
of
the
suffrage  regulation
which
instead
of
the
equality
nature
ordains
creates
an
odious
distinction
between
members
of
the

community
and

in

of
their
public
services

the
arena
the
spirit
of
the
new
order
soon
had  pronounced
effect
on
the
machinery
of
government
and
the
practice
of
politics

enfranchised

were
not

in

and

early
established
in
several
states
notably
new

closely
connected

at

time
the
principle
of

was
extended
to

the
spirit
of
democracy
while
playing
havoc
with
the
old
order
in

made
its
way
upward
into
the
federal
system
the
framers
of
the
constitution
bewildered
by
many
proposals
and
unable
to
agree
on
any
single
plan
had
committed
the
choice
of
presidential
electors
to
the
discretion
of
the
state
legislatures
the
legislatures
in
turn
greedy
of
power
early
adopted
the
practice
of
choosing
the
electors
themselves
but
they
did
not
enjoy
it
long
undisturbed
democracy
thundering
at
their
doors
demanded
that
they
surrender
the
privilege
to
the
people
reluctantly
they
yielded
sometimes
granting
popular
election
and
then
withdrawing
it
the
drift
was
inevitable
and
the
climax
came
with
the
advent
of

democracy
in
vermont

delaware
south

georgia
and
louisiana
though
some
had
experimented
with

still

eight
years
later
south
carolina
alone
held
to
the
old
practice
popular
election
had
become
the
final
word
the
fanciful
idea
of
an
electoral
college
of
good
and
wise
men
selected
without
passion
or
partisanship
by
state
legislatures
acting
as
deliberative
bodies
was
exploded
for
all
time
the
election
of
the
nation  chief
magistrate
was
committed
to
the
tempestuous
methods
of
democracy
the
nominating
convention
as
the
suffrage
was
widened
and
the
popular
choice
of
presidential
electors
extended
there
arose  violent
protest
against
the
methods
used
by
the
political
parties
in
nominating
candidates
after
the
retirement
of
washington
both
the
republicans
and
the
federalists
found
it
necessary
to
agree
upon
their
favorites
before
the
election
and
they
adopted  colonial
device
the
pre
election
caucus
the
federalist
members
of
congress
held  conference
and
selected
their
candidate
and
the
republicans
followed
the
example
in  short
time
the
practice
of
nominating
by  congressional
caucus
became  recognized
institution
the
election
still
remained
with
the
people
but
the
power
of
picking
candidates
for
their
approval
passed
into
the
hands
of  small
body
of
senators
and
representatives  reaction
against
this
was
unavoidable
to
friends
of
the
plain
people
like
andrew
jackson
it
was
intolerable
all
the
more
so
because
the
caucus
never
favored
him
with
the
nomination
more
conservative
men
also
found
grave
objections
to
it
they
pointed
out
that
whereas
the
constitution
intended
the
president
to
be
an
independent
officer
he
had
now
fallen
under
the
control
of  caucus
of
congressmen
the
supremacy
of
the
legislative
branch
had
been
obtained
by
an
extra
legal
political
device
to
such
objections
were
added
practical
considerations
in
when
personal
rivalry
had
taken
the
place
of
party
conflicts
the
congressional
caucus
selected
as
the
candidate
william  crawford
of
georgia  man
of
distinction
but
no
great
popularity
passing
by
such
an
obvious
hero
as
general
jackson
the
followers
of
the
general
were
enraged
and
demanded
nothing
short
of
the
death
of
king
caucus
their
clamor
was
effective
under
their
attacks
the
caucus
came
to
an
ignominious
end
in
place
of
it
there
arose
in  new
device
the
national
nominating
convention
composed
of
delegates
elected
by
party
voters
for
the
sole
purpose
of
nominating
candidates
senators
and
representatives
were
still
prominent
in
the
party
councils
but
they
were
swamped
by
hundreds
of
delegates
fresh
from
the
people
as
jackson
was
wont
to
say
in
fact
each
convention
was
made
up
mainly
of
office
holders
and
office
seekers
and
the
new
institution
was
soon
denounced
as
vigorously
as
king
caucus
had
been
particularly
by
statesmen
who
failed
to
obtain  nomination
still
it
grew
in
strength
and
by
was
firmly
established
the
end
of
the
old
generation
in
the
election
of
the
representatives
of
the
aristocracy
made
their
last
successful
stand
until
then
the
leadership
by
men
of
wealth
and
talents
had
been
undisputed
there
had
been
five
presidents
washington
john
adams
jefferson
madison
and
monroe
all
eastern
men
brought
up
in
prosperous
families
with
the
advantages
of
culture
which
come
from
leisure
and
the
possession
of
life  refinements
none
of
them
had
ever
been
compelled
to
work
with
his
hands
for  livelihood
four
of
them
had
been
slaveholders
jefferson
was  philosopher
learned
in
natural
science  master
of
foreign
languages  gentleman
of
dignity
and
grace
of
manner
notwithstanding
his
studied
simplicity
madison
it
was
said
was
armed
with
all
the
culture
of
his
century
monroe
was  graduate
of
william
and
mary  gentleman
of
the
old
school
jefferson
and
his
three
successors
called
themselves
republicans
and
professed  genuine
faith
in
the
people
but
they
were
not
of
the
people
themselves
they
were
not
sons
of
the
soil
or
the
workshop
they
were
all
men
of
the
grand
old
order
of
society
who
gave
finish
and
style
even
to
popular
government
monroe
was
the
last
of
the
presidents
belonging
to
the
heroic
epoch
of
the
revolution
he
had
served
in
the
war
for
independence
in
the
congress
under
the
articles
of
confederation
and
in
official
capacity
after
the
adoption
of
the
constitution
in
short
he
was
of
the
age
that
had
wrought
american
independence
and
set
the
government
afloat
with
his
passing
leadership
went
to  new
generation
but
his
successor
john
quincy
adams
formed  bridge
between
the
old
and
the
new
in
that
he
combined  high
degree
of
culture
with
democratic
sympathies
washington
had
died
in
preceded
but  few
months
by
patrick
henry
and
followed
in
four
years
by
samuel
adams
hamilton
had
been
killed
in  duel
with
burr
in
thomas
jefferson
and
john
adams
were
yet
alive
in
but
they
were
soon
to
pass
from
the
scene
reconciled
at
last
full
of
years
and
honors
madison
was
in
dignified
retirement
destined
to
live
long
enough
to
protest
against
the
doctrine
of
nullification
proclaimed
by
south
carolina
before
death
carried
him
away
at
the
ripe
old
age
of
eighty
five
the
election
of
john
quincy
adams
the
campaign
of
marked
the
end
of
the
era
of
good
feeling
inaugurated
by
the
collapse
of
the
federalist
party
after
the
election
of
there
were
four
leading
candidates
john
quincy
adams
andrew
jackson
henry
clay
and  h
crawford
the
result
of
the
election
was  division
of
the
electoral
votes
into
four
parts
and
no
one
received  majority
under
the
constitution
therefore
the
selection
of
president
passed
to
the
house
of
representatives
clay
who
stood
at
the
bottom
of
the
poll
threw
his
weight
to
adams
and
assured
his
triumph
much
to
the
chagrin
of
jackson  friends
they
thought
with  certain
justification
that
inasmuch
as
the
hero
of
new
orleans
had
received
the
largest
electoral
vote
the
house
was
morally
bound
to
accept
the
popular
judgment
and
make
him
president
jackson
shook
hands
cordially
with
adams
on
the
day
of
the
inauguration
but
never
forgave
him
for
being
elected
while
adams
called
himself  republican
in
politics
and
often
spoke
of
the
rule
of
the
people
he
was
regarded
by
jackson  followers
as
an
aristocrat
he
was
not  son
of
the
soil
neither
was
he
acquainted
at
first
hand
with
the
labor
of
farmers
and
mechanics
he
had
been
educated
at
harvard
and
in
europe
like
his
illustrious
father
john
adams
he
was  stern
and
reserved
man
little
given
to
seeking
popularity
moreover
he
was
from
the
east
and
the
frontiersmen
of
the
west
regarded
him
as  man
born
with  silver
spoon
in
his
mouth
jackson  supporters
especially
disliked
him
because
they
thought
their
hero
entitled
to
the
presidency
their
anger
was
deepened
when
adams
appointed
clay
to
the
office
of
secretary
of
state
and
they
set
up  cry
that
there
had
been  deal
by
which
clay
had
helped
to
elect
adams
to
get
office
for
himself
though
adams
conducted
his
administration
with
great
dignity
and
in  fine
spirit
of
public
service
he
was
unable
to
overcome
the
opposition
which
he
encountered
on
his
election
to
office
or
to
win
popularity
in
the
west
and
south
on
the
contrary
by
advocating
government
assistance
in
building
roads
and
canals
and
public
grants
in
aid
of
education
arts
and
sciences
he
ran
counter
to
the
current
which
had
set
in
against
appropriations
of
federal
funds
for
internal
improvements
by
signing
the
tariff
bill
of
soon
known
as
the
tariff
of
abominations
he
made
new
enemies
without
adding
to
his
friends
in
new
york
pennsylvania
and
ohio
where
he
sorely
needed
them
handicapped
by
the
false
charge
that
he
had
been  party
to  corrupt
bargain
with
clay
to
secure
his
first
election
attacked
for
his
advocacy
of  high
protective
tariff
charged
with
favoring
an
aristocracy
of
office
holders
in
washington
on
account
of
his
refusal
to
discharge
government
clerks
by
the
wholesale
adams
was
retired
from
the
white
house
after
he
had
served
four
years
the
triumph
of
jackson
in
probably
no
candidate
for
the
presidency
ever
had
such
passionate
popular
support
as
andrew
jackson
had
in
he
was
truly  man
of
the
people
born
of
poor
parents
in
the
upland
region
of
south
carolina
schooled
in
poverty
and
adversity
without
the
advantages
of
education
or
the
refinements
of
cultivated
leisure
he
seemed
the
embodiment
of
the
spirit
of
the
new
american
democracy
early
in
his
youth
he
had
gone
into
the
frontier
of
tennessee
where
he
soon
won  name
as  fearless
and
intrepid
indian
fighter
on
the
march
and
in
camp
he
endeared
himself
to
his
men
by
sharing
their
hardships
sleeping
on
the
ground
with
them
and
eating
parched
corn
when
nothing
better
could
be
found
for
the
privates
from
local
prominence
he
sprang
into
national
fame
by
his
exploit
at
the
battle
of
new
orleans
his
reputation
as  military
hero
was
enhanced
by
the
feeling
that
he
had
been  martyr
to
political
treachery
in
the
farmers
of
the
west
and
south
claimed
him
as
their
own
the
mechanics
of
the
eastern
cities
newly
enfranchised
also
looked
upon
him
as
their
friend
though
his
views
on
the
tariff
internal
improvements
and
other
issues
before
the
country
were
either
vague
or
unknown
he
was
readily
elected
president
the
returns
of
the
electoral
vote
in
revealed
the
sources
of
jackson  power
in
new
england
he
received
but
one
ballot
from
maine
he
had  majority
of
the
electors
in
new
york
and
all
of
them
in
pennsylvania
and
he
carried
every
state
south
of
maryland
and
beyond
the
appalachians
adams
did
not
get  single
electoral
vote
in
the
south
and
west
the
prophecy
of
the
hartford
convention
had
been
fulfilled
illustration
andrew
jackson
when
jackson
took
the
oath
of
office
on
march
the
government
of
the
united
states
entered
into  new
era
until
this
time
the
inauguration
of  president
even
that
of
jefferson
the
apostle
of
simplicity
had
brought
no
rude
shock
to
the
course
of
affairs
at
the
capital
hitherto
the
installation
of  president
meant
that
an
old
fashioned
gentleman
accompanied
by  few
servants
had
driven
to
the
white
house
in
his
own
coach
taken
the
oath
with
quiet
dignity
appointed  few
new
men
to
the
higher
posts
continued
in
office
the
long
list
of
regular
civil
employees
and
begun
his
administration
with
respectable
decorum
jackson
changed
all
this
when
he
was
inaugurated
men
and
women
journeyed
hundreds
of
miles
to
witness
the
ceremony
great
throngs
pressed
into
the
white
house
upset
the
bowls
of
punch
broke
the
glasses
and
stood
with
their
muddy
boots
on
the
satin
covered
chairs
to
see
the
people  president
if
jefferson  inauguration
was
as
he
called
it
the
great
revolution
jackson  inauguration
was  cataclysm
the
new
democracy
at
washington
the
spoils
system
the
staid
and
respectable
society
of
washington
was
disturbed
by
this
influx
of
farmers
and
frontiersmen
to
speak
of
politics
became
bad
form
among
fashionable
women
the
clerks
and
civil
servants
of
the
government
who
had
enjoyed
long
and
secure
tenure
of
office
became
alarmed
at
the
clamor
of
new
men
for
their
positions
doubtless
the
major
portion
of
them
had
opposed
the
election
of
jackson
and
looked
with
feelings
akin
to
contempt
upon
him
and
his
followers
with  hunter  instinct
jackson
scented
his
prey
determined
to
have
none
but
his
friends
in
office
he
made  clean
sweep
expelling
old
employees
to
make
room
for
men
fresh
from
the
people
this
was  new
custom
other
presidents
had
discharged  few
officers
for
engaging
in
opposition
politics
they
had
been
careful
in
making
appointments
not
to
choose
inveterate
enemies
but
they
discharged
relatively
few
men
on
account
of
their
political
views
and
partisan
activities
by
wholesale
removals
and
the
frank
selection
of
officers
on
party
grounds  practice
already
well
intrenched
in
new
york
jackson
established
the
spoils
system
at
washington
the
famous
slogan
to
the
victor
belong
the
spoils
of
victory
became
the
avowed
principle
of
the
national
government
statesmen
like
calhoun
denounced
it
poets
like
james
russell
lowell
ridiculed
it
faithful
servants
of
the
government
suffered
under
it
but
it
held
undisturbed
sway
for
half  century
thereafter
each
succeeding
generation
outdoing
if
possible
its
predecessor
in
the
use
of
public
office
for
political
purposes
if
any
one
remarked
that
training
and
experience
were
necessary
qualifications
for
important
public
positions
he
met
jackson  own
profession
of
faith
the
duties
of
any
public
office
are
so
simple
or
admit
of
being
made
so
simple
that
any
man
can
in  short
time
become
master
of
them
the
tariff
and
nullification
jackson
had
not
been
installed
in
power
very
long
before
he
was
compelled
to
choose
between
states
rights
and
nationalism
the
immediate
occasion
of
the
trouble
was
the
tariff  matter
on
which
jackson
did
not
have
any
very
decided
views
his
mind
did
not
run
naturally
to
abstruse
economic
questions
and
owing
to
the
divided
opinion
of
the
country
it
was
good
politics
to
be
vague
and
ambiguous
in
the
controversy
especially
was
this
true
because
the
tariff
issue
was
threatening
to
split
the
country
into
parties
again
the
development
of
the
policy
of
protection
the
war
of
and
the
commercial
policies
of
england
which
followed
it
had
accentuated
the
need
for
american
economic
independence
during
that
conflict
the
united
states
cut
off
from
english
manufactures
as
during
the
revolution
built
up
home
industries
to
meet
the
unusual
call
for
iron
steel
cloth
and
other
military
and
naval
supplies
as
well
as
the
demands
from
ordinary
markets
iron
foundries
and
textile
mills
sprang
up
as
in
the
night
hundreds
of
business
men
invested
fortunes
in
industrial
enterprises
so
essential
to
the
military
needs
of
the
government
and
the
people
at
large
fell
into
the
habit
of
buying
american
made
goods
again
as
the
london
times
tersely
observed
of
the
americans
their
first
war
with
england
made
them
independent
their
second
war
made
them
formidable
in
recognition
of
this
state
of
affairs
the
tariff
of
was
designed
first
to
prevent
england
from
ruining
these
infant
industries
by
dumping
the
accumulated
stores
of
years
suddenly
upon
american
markets
and
secondly
to
enlarge
in
the
manufacturing
centers
the
demand
for
american
agricultural
produce
it
accomplished
the
purposes
of
its
framers
it
kept
in
operation
the
mills
and
furnaces
so
recently
built
it
multiplied
the
number
of
industrial
workers
and
enhanced
the
demand
for
the
produce
of
the
soil
it
brought
about
another
very
important
result
it
turned
the
capital
and
enterprise
of
new
england
from
shipping
to
manufacturing
and
converted
her
statesmen
once
friends
of
low
tariffs
into
ardent
advocates
of
protection
in
the
early
years
of
the
nineteenth
century
the
yankees
had
bent
their
energies
toward
building
and
operating
ships
to
carry
produce
from
america
to
europe
and
manufactures
from
europe
to
america
for
this
reason
they
had
opposed
the
tariff
of
calculated
to
increase
domestic
production
and
cut
down
the
carrying
trade
defeated
in
their
efforts
they
accepted
the
inevitable
and
turned
to
manufacturing
soon
they
were
powerful
friends
of
protection
for
american
enterprise
as
the
money
invested
and
the
labor
employed
in
the
favored
industries
increased
the
demand
for
continued
and
heavier
protection
grew
apace
even
the
farmers
who
furnished
raw
materials
like
wool
flax
and
hemp
began
to
see
eye
to
eye
with
the
manufacturers
so
the
textile
interests
of
new
england
the
iron
masters
of
connecticut
new
jersey
and
pennsylvania
the
wool
hemp
and
flax
growers
of
ohio
kentucky
and
tennessee
and
the
sugar
planters
of
louisiana
developed
into  formidable
combination
in
support
of  high
protective
tariff
the
planting
states
oppose
the
tariff
in
the
meantime
the
cotton
states
on
the
seaboard
had
forgotten
about
the
havoc
wrought
during
the
napoleonic
wars
when
their
produce
rotted
because
there
were
no
ships
to
carry
it
to
europe
the
seas
were
now
open
the
area
devoted
to
cotton
had
swiftly
expanded
as
alabama
mississippi
and
louisiana
were
opened
up
cotton
had
in
fact
become
king
and
the
planters
depended
for
their
prosperity
as
they
thought
upon
the
sale
of
their
staple
to
english
manufacturers
whose
spinning
and
weaving
mills
were
the
wonder
of
the
world
manufacturing
nothing
and
having
to
buy
nearly
everything
except
farm
produce
and
even
much
of
that
for
slaves
the
planters
naturally
wanted
to
purchase
manufactures
in
the
cheapest
market
england
where
they
sold
most
of
their
cotton
the
tariff
they
contended
raised
the
price
of
the
goods
they
had
to
buy
and
was
thus
in
fact  tribute
laid
on
them
for
the
benefit
of
the
northern
mill
owners
the
tariff
of
abominations
they
were
overborne
however
in
and
again
in
when
northern
manufacturers
and
western
farmers
forced
congress
to
make
an
upward
revision
of
the
tariff
the
act
of
known
as
the
tariff
of
abominations
though
slightly
modified
in
was
the
straw
which
broke
the
camel  back
southern
leaders
turned
in
rage
against
the
whole
system
the
legislatures
of
virginia
north
carolina
south
carolina
georgia
and
alabama
denounced
it  general
convention
of
delegates
held
at
augusta
issued  protest
of
defiance
against
it
and
south
carolina
weary
of
verbal
battles
decided
to
prevent
its
enforcement
south
carolina
nullifies
the
tariff
the
legislature
of
that
state
on
october
passed  bill
calling
for  state
convention
which
duly
assembled
in
the
following
month
in
no
mood
for
compromise
it
adopted
the
famous
ordinance
of
nullification
after  few
days
debate
every
line
of
this
document
was
clear
and
firm
the
tariff
it
opened
gives
bounties
to
classes
and
individuals
at
the
expense
and
to
the
injury
and
oppression
of
other
classes
and
individuals
it
is  violation
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
therefore
null
and
void
its
enforcement
in
south
carolina
is
unlawful
if
the
federal
government
attempts
to
coerce
the
state
into
obeying
the
law
the
people
of
this
state
will
thenceforth
hold
themselves
absolved
from
all
further
obligations
to
maintain
or
preserve
their
political
connection
with
the
people
of
the
other
states
and
will
forthwith
proceed
to
organize  separate
government
and
do
all
other
acts
and
things
which

to
this
note
of

repudiated
the
step
which
south

had
taken
georgia
responded
we
abhor
the
doctrine
of
nullification

neither  peaceful

alabama

north

it

spoke
more

in

the
eyes
of
the

were
turned
upon
andrew

it
was
known
that
he
looked
with
no
friendly
feelings
upon
nullification
for
at  jefferson
dinner
in
the
spring
of
while
the
subject
was
in
the
air
he
had
with
laconic
firmness
announced  toast
our
federal
union
it
must
be
preserved
when
two
years
later
the
open
challenge
came
from
south
carolina
he
replied
that
he
would
enforce
the
law
saying
with
his
frontier
directness
if  single
drop
of
blood
shall
be
shed
there
in
opposition
to
the

keep
his
word
by
preparing
for
the
use
of

forces
in
sustaining
the
authority
of
the
federal
government
then
in  long
and
impassioned
proclamation
to
the
people
of
south
carolina
he
pointed
out
the
national
character
of
the
union
and
announced
his
solemn
resolve
to
preserve
it
by
all
constitutional
means
nullification
he
branded
as
incompatible
with
the
existence
of
the
union
contradicted
expressly
by
the
letter
of
the
constitution
unauthorized
by
its
spirit
inconsistent
with
every
principle
on
which
it
was
founded
and
destructive
of
the
great
objects
for
which
it
was
formed  compromise
in
his
messages
to
congress
however
jackson
spoke
the
language
of
conciliation  few
days
before
issuing
his
proclamation
he
suggested
that
protection
should
be
limited
to
the
articles
of
domestic
manufacture
indispensable
to
safety
in
war
time
and
shortly
afterward
he
asked
for
new
legislation
to
aid
him
in
enforcing
the
laws
with
two
propositions
before
it
one
to
remove
the
chief
grounds
for

the
other

up
after  short
but
acrimonious
debate
both
measures
were
passed
and
signed
by
president
jackson
on
the

day
march
looking
upon
the
reduction
of
the

as  complete
vindication

policy

debate
where
the
actual
victory
lay
in
this
quarrel
long
the
subject
of
high
dispute
need
not
concern
us
to

perhaps
the
chief
result
of
the
whole
affair
was  clarification
of
the
issue
between
the
north
and
the

statement
of
the
principles
for
which
men
on
both
sides
were
years
afterward
to
lay
down
their
lives
on
behalf
of
nationalism
and  perpetual
union
the
stanch
old
democrat
from
tennessee
had
in
his
proclamation
on
nullification
spoken  language
that
admitted
of
only
one
meaning
on
behalf
of
nullification
senator
hayne
of
south
carolina  skilled
lawyer
and
courtly
orator
had
in  great
speech
delivered
in
the
senate
in
january
set
forth
clearly
and
cogently
the
doctrine
that
the
union
is  compact
among
sovereign
states
from
which
the
parties
may
lawfully
withdraw
it
was
this
address
that
called
into
the
arena
daniel
webster
senator
from
massachusetts
who
spreading
the
mantle
of
oblivion
over
the
hartford
convention
delivered  reply
to
hayne
that
has
been
reckoned
among
the
powerful
orations
of
all
time  plea
for
the
supremacy
of
the
constitution
and
the
national
character
of
the
union
the
war
on
the
united
states
bank
if
events
forced
the
issue
of
nationalism
and
nullification
upon
jackson
the
same
could
not
be
said
of
his
attack
on
the
bank
that
institution
once
denounced
by
every
true
jeffersonian
had
been
reestablished
in
under
the
administration
of
jefferson  disciple
james
madison
it
had
not
been
in
operation
very
long
however
before
it
aroused
bitter
opposition
especially
in
the
south
and
the
west
its
notes
drove
out
of
circulation
the
paper
currency
of
unsound
banks
chartered
by
the
states
to
the
great
anger
of
local
financiers
it
was
accused
of
favoritism
in
making
loans
of
conferring
special
privileges
upon
politicians
in
return
for
their
support
at
washington
to
all
jackson  followers
it
was
an
insidious
money
power
one
of
them
openly
denounced
it
as
an
institution
designed
to
strengthen
the
arm
of
wealth
and
counterpoise
the
influence
of
extended
suffrage
in
the
disposition
of
public
affairs
this
sentiment
president
jackson
fully
shared
in
his
first
message
to
congress
he
assailed
the
bank
in
vigorous
language
he
declared
that
its
constitutionality
was
in
doubt
and
alleged
that
it
had
failed
to
establish  sound
and
uniform
currency
if
such
an
institution
was
necessary
he
continued
it
should
be  public
bank
owned
and
managed
by
the
government
not  private
concern
endowed
with
special
privileges
by
it
in
his
second
and
third
messages
jackson
came
back
to
the
subject
leaving
the
decision
however
to
an
enlightened
people
and
their
representatives
moved
by
this
frank
hostility
and
anxious
for
the
future
the
bank
applied
to
congress
for  renewal
of
its
charter
in
four
years
before
the
expiration
of
its
life
clay
with
his
eye
upon
the
presidency
and
an
issue
for
the
campaign
warmly
supported
the
application
congress
deeply
impressed
by
his
leadership
passed
the
bill
granting
the
new
charter
and
sent
the
open
defiance
to
jackson
his
response
was
an
instant
veto
the
battle
was
on
and
it
raged
with
fury
until
the
close
of
his
second
administration
ending
in
the
destruction
of
the
bank  disordered
currency
and  national
panic
in
his
veto
message
jackson
attacked
the
bank
as
unconstitutional
and
even
hinted
at
corruption
he
refused
to
assent
to
the
proposition
that
the
supreme
court
had
settled
the
question
of
constitutionality
by
the
decision
in
the
mcculloch
case
each
public
officer
he
argued
who
takes
an
oath
to
support
the
constitution
swears
that
he
will
support
it
as
he
understands
it
not
as
it
is
understood
by
others
not
satisfied
with
his
veto
and
his
declaration
against
the
bank
jackson
ordered
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
to
withdraw
the
government
deposits
which
formed  large
part
of
the
institution  funds
this
action
he
followed
up
by
an
open
charge
that
the
bank
had
used
money
shamefully
to
secure
the
return
of
its
supporters
to
congress
the
senate
stung
by
this
charge
solemnly
resolved
that
jackson
had
assumed
upon
himself
authority
and
power
not
conferred
by
the
constitution
and
laws
but
in
derogation
of
both
the
effects
of
the
destruction
of
the
bank
were
widespread
when
its
charter
expired
in
banking
was
once
more
committed
to
the
control
of
the
states
the
state
legislatures
under  decision
rendered
by
the
supreme
court
after
the
death
of
marshall
began
to
charter
banks
under
state
ownership
and
control
with
full
power
to
issue
paper
money
this
in
spite
of
the
provision
in
the
constitution
that
states
shall
not
issue
bills
of
credit
or
make
anything
but
gold
and
silver
coin
legal
tender
in
the
payment
of
debts
once
more
the
country
was
flooded
by
paper
currency
of
uncertain
value
to
make
matters
worse
jackson
adopted
the
practice
of
depositing
huge
amounts
of
government
funds
in
these
banks
not
forgetting
to
render
favors
to
those
institutions
which
supported
him
in
politics
pet
banks
as
they
were
styled
at
the
time
in
partially
though
by
no
means
entirely
as  result
of
the
abolition
of
the
bank
the
country
was
plunged
into
one
of
the
most
disastrous
panics
which
it
ever
experienced
internal
improvements
checked
the
bank
had
presented
to
jackson  very
clear
problem
one
of
destruction
other
questions
were
not
so
simple
particularly
the
subject
of
federal
appropriations
in
aid
of
roads
and
other
internal
improvements
jefferson
had
strongly
favored
government
assistance
in
such
matters
but
his
administration
was
followed
by  reaction
both
madison
and
monroe
vetoed
acts
of
congress
appropriating
public
funds
for
public
roads
advancing
as
their
reason
the
argument
that
the
constitution
authorized
no
such
laws
jackson
puzzled
by
the
clamor
on
both
sides
followed
their
example
without
making
the
constitutional
bar
absolute
congress
he
thought
might
lawfully
build
highways
of  national
and
military
value
but
he
strongly
deprecated
attacks
by
local
interests
on
the
federal
treasury
the
triumph
of
the
executive
branch
jackson  reelection
in
served
to
confirm
his
opinion
that
he
was
the
chosen
leader
of
the
people
freed
and
instructed
to
ride
rough
shod
over
congress
and
even
the
courts
no
president
before
or
since
ever
entertained
in
times
of
peace
such
lofty
notions
of
executive
prerogative
the
entire
body
of
federal
employees
he
transformed
into
obedient
servants
of
his
wishes  sign
or  nod
from
him
making
and
undoing
the
fortunes
of
the
humble
and
the
mighty
his
lawful
cabinet
of
advisers
filling
all
of
the
high
posts
in
the
government
he
treated
with
scant
courtesy
preferring
rather
to
secure
his
counsel
and
advice
from
an
unofficial
body
of
friends
and
dependents
who
owing
to
their
secret
methods
and
back
stairs
arrangements
became
known
as
the
kitchen
cabinet
under
the
leadership
of  silent
astute
and
resourceful
politician
amos
kendall
this
informal
gathering
of
the
faithful
both
gave
and
carried
out
decrees
and
orders
communicating
the
president  lightest
wish
or
strictest
command
to
the
uttermost
part
of
the
country
resolutely
and
in
the
face
of
bitter
opposition
jackson
had
removed
the
deposits
from
the
united
states
bank
when
the
senate
protested
against
this
arbitrary
conduct
he
did
not
rest
until
it
was
forced
to
expunge
the
resolution
of
condemnation
in
time
one
of
his
lieutenants
with
his
own
hands
was
able
to
tear
the
censure
from
the
records
when
chief
justice
marshall
issued  decree
against
georgia
which
did
not
suit
him
jackson
according
to
tradition
blurted
out
that
marshall
could
go
ahead
and
enforce
his
own
orders
to
the
end
he
pursued
his
willful
way
finally
even
choosing
his
own
successor
the
rise
of
the
whigs
jackson  measures
arouse
opposition
measures
so
decided
policies
so
radical
and
conduct
so
high
handed
could
not
fail
to
arouse
against
jackson  deep
and
exasperated
opposition
the
truth
is
the
conduct
of
his
entire
administration
profoundly
disturbed
the
business
and
finances
of
the
country
it
was
accompanied
by
conditions
similar
to
those
which
existed
under
the
articles
of
confederation  paper
currency
almost
as
unstable
and
irritating
as
the
worthless
notes
of
revolutionary
days
flooded
the
country
hindering
the
easy
transaction
of
business
the
use
of
federal
funds
for
internal
improvements
so
vital
to
the
exchange
of
commodities
which
is
the
very
life
of
industry
was
blocked
by
executive
vetoes
the
supreme
court
which
under
marshall
had
held
refractory
states
to
their
obligations
under
the
constitution
was
flouted
states
rights
judges
deliberately
selected
by
jackson
for
the
bench
began
to
sap
and
undermine
the
rulings
of
marshall
the
protective
tariff
under
which
the
textile
industry
of
new
england
the
iron
mills
of
pennsylvania
and
the
wool
flax
and
hemp
farms
of
the
west
had
flourished
had
received  severe
blow
in
the
compromise
of
which
promised  steady
reduction
of
duties
to
cap
the
climax
jackson  party
casting
aside
the
old
and
reputable
name
of
republican
boldly
chose
for
its
title
the
term
democrat
throwing
down
the
gauntlet
to
every
conservative
who
doubted
the
omniscience
of
the
people
all
these
things
worked
together
to
evoke
an
opposition
that
was
sharp
and
determined
illustration
an
old
cartoon
ridiculing
clay  tariff
and
internal
improvement
program
clay
and
the
national
republicans
in
this
opposition
movement
leadership
fell
to
henry
clay  son
of
kentucky
rather
than
to
daniel
webster
of
massachusetts
like
jackson
clay
was
born
in  home
haunted
by
poverty
left
fatherless
early
and
thrown
upon
his
own
resources
he
went
from
virginia
into
kentucky
where
by
sheer
force
of
intellect
he
rose
to
eminence
in
the
profession
of
law
without
the
martial
gifts
or
the
martial
spirit
of
jackson
he
slipped
more
easily
into
the
social
habits
of
the
east
at
the
same
time
that
he
retained
his
hold
on
the
affections
of
the
boisterous
west
farmers
of
ohio
indiana
and
kentucky
loved
him
financiers
of
new
york
and
philadelphia
trusted
him
he
was
thus  leader
well
fitted
to
gather
the
forces
of
opposition
into
union
against
jackson
around
clay  standard
assembled  motley
collection
representing
every
species
of
political
opinion
united
by
one
tie
only
hatred
for
old
hickory
nullifiers
and
less
strenuous
advocates
of
states
rights
were
yoked
with
nationalists
of
webster  school
ardent
protectionists
were
bound
together
with
equally
ardent
free
traders
all
fraternizing
in
one
grand
confusion
of
ideas
under
the
title
of
national
republicans
thus
the
ancient
and
honorable
term
selected
by
jefferson
and
his
party
now
abandoned
by
jacksonian
democracy
was
adroitly
adopted
to
cover
the
supporters
of
clay
the
platform
of
the
party
however
embraced
all
the
old
federalist
principles
protection
for
american
industry
internal
improvements
respect
for
the
supreme
court
resistance
to
executive
tyranny
and
denunciation
of
the
spoils
system
though
jackson
was
easily
victorious
in
the
popular
vote
cast
for
clay
should
have
given
him
some
doubts
about
the
faith
of
the
whole
people
in
the
wisdom
of
his
reign
van
buren
and
the
panic
of
nothing
could
shake
the
general  superb
confidence
at
the
end
of
his
second
term
he
insisted
on
selecting
his
own
successor
at  national
convention
chosen
by
party
voters
but
packed
with
his
office
holders
and
friends
he
nominated
martin
van
buren
of
new
york
once
more
he
proved
his
strength
by
carrying
the
country
for
the
democrats
with  fine
flourish
he
attended
the
inauguration
of
van
buren
and
then
retired
amid
the
applause
and
tears
of
his
devotees
to
the
hermitage
his
home
in
tennessee
fortunately
for
him
jackson
escaped
the
odium
of  disastrous
panic
which
struck
the
country
with
terrible
force
in
the
following
summer
among
the
contributory
causes
of
this
crisis
no
doubt
were
the
destruction
of
the
bank
and
the
issuance
of
the
specie
circular
of
which
required
the
purchasers
of
public
lands
to
pay
for
them
in
coin
instead
of
the
paper
notes
of
state
banks
whatever
the
dominating
cause
the
ruin
was
widespread
bank
after
bank
went
under
boom
towns
in
the
west
collapsed
eastern
mills
shut
down
and
working
people
in
the
industrial
centers
starving
from
unemployment
begged
for
relief
van
buren
braved
the
storm
offering
no
measure
of
reform
or
assistance
to
the
distracted
people
he
did
seek
security
for
government
funds
by
suggesting
the
removal
of
deposits
from
private
banks
and
the
establishment
of
an
independent
treasury
system
with
government
depositaries
for
public
funds
in
several
leading
cities
this
plan
was
finally
accepted
by
congress
in
had
van
buren
been  captivating
figure
he
might
have
lived
down
the
discredit
of
the
panic
unjustly
laid
at
his
door
but
he
was
far
from
being  favorite
with
the
populace
though  man
of
many
talents
he
owed
his
position
to
the
quiet
and
adept
management
of
jackson
rather
than
to
his
own
personal
qualities
the
men
of
the
frontier
did
not
care
for
him
they
suspected
that
he
ate
from
gold
plate
and
they
could
not
forgive
him
for
being
an
astute
politician
from
new
york
still
the
democratic
party
remembering
jackson  wishes
renominated
him
unanimously
in
and
saw
him
go
down
to
utter
defeat
the
whigs
and
general
harrison
by
this
time
the
national
republicans
now
known
as
whigs  title
taken
from
the
party
of
opposition
to
the
crown
in
england
had
learned
many
lessons
taking  leaf
out
of
the
democratic
book
they
nominated
not
clay
of
kentucky
well
known
for
his
views
on
the
bank
the
tariff
and
internal
improvements
but  military
hero
general
william
henry
harrison  man
of
uncertain
political
opinions
harrison  son
of  virginia
signer
of
the
declaration
of
independence
sprang
into
public
view
by
winning  battle
more
famous
than
important
tippecanoe  brush
with
the
indians
in
indiana
he
added
to
his
laurels
by
rendering
praiseworthy
services
during
the
war
of
when
days
of
peace
returned
he
was
rewarded
by  grateful
people
with  seat
in
congress
then
he
retired
to
quiet
life
in  little
village
near
cincinnati
like
jackson
he
was
held
to
be  son
of
the
south
and
the
west
like
jackson
he
was  military
hero  lesser
light
but
still  light
like
old
hickory
he
rode
into
office
on  tide
of
popular
feeling
against
an
eastern
man
accused
of
being
something
of
an
aristocrat
his
personal
popularity
was
sufficient
the
whigs
who
nominated
him
shrewdly
refused
to
adopt  platform
or
declare
their
belief
in
anything
when
some
democrat
asserted
that
harrison
was  backwoodsman
whose
sole
wants
were  jug
of
hard
cider
and  log
cabin
the
whigs
treated
the
remark
not
as
an
insult
but
as
proof
positive
that
harrison
deserved
the
votes
of
jackson
men
the
jug
and
the
cabin
they
proudly
transformed
into
symbols
of
the
campaign
and
won
for
their
chieftain
electoral
votes
while
van
buren
got
only
sixty
harrison
and
tyler
the
hero
of
tippecanoe
was
not
long
to
enjoy
the
fruits
of
his
victory
the
hungry
horde
of
whig
office
seekers
descended
upon
him
like
wolves
upon
the
fold
if
he
went
out
they
waylaid
him
if
he
stayed
indoors
he
was
besieged
not
even
his
bed
chamber
was
spared
he
was
none
too
strong
at
best
and
he
took  deep
cold
on
the
day
of
his
inauguration
between
driving
out
democrats
and
appeasing
whigs
he
fell
mortally
ill
before
the
end
of  month
he
lay
dead
at
the
capitol
harrison  successor
john
tyler
the
vice
president
whom
the
whigs
had
nominated
to
catch
votes
in
virginia
was
more
of  democrat
than
anything
else
though
he
was
not
partisan
enough
to
please
anybody
the
whigs
railed
at
him
because
he
would
not
approve
the
founding
of
another
united
states
bank
the
democrats
stormed
at
him
for
refusing
until
near
the
end
of
his
term
to
sanction
the
annexation
of
texas
which
had
declared
its
independence
of
mexico
in
his
entire
administration
marked
by
unseemly
wrangling
produced
only
two
measures
of
importance
the
whigs
flushed
by
victory
with
the
aid
of  few
protectionist
democrats
enacted
in  new
tariff
law
destroying
the
compromise
which
had
brought
about
the
truce
between
the
north
and
the
south
in
the
days
of
nullification
the
distinguished
leader
of
the
whigs
daniel
webster
as
secretary
of
state
in
negotiation
with
lord
ashburton
representing
great
britain
settled
the
long
standing
dispute
between
the
two
countries
over
the
maine
boundary  year
after
closing
this
chapter
in
american
diplomacy
webster
withdrew
to
private
life
leaving
the
president
to
endure
alone
the
buffets
of
political
fortune
to
the
end
the
whigs
regarded
tyler
as  traitor
to
their
cause
but
the
judgment
of
history
is
that
it
was  case
of
the
biter
bitten
they
had
nominated
him
for
the
vice
presidency
as  man
of
views
acceptable
to
southern
democrats
in
order
to
catch
their
votes
little
reckoning
with
the
chances
of
his
becoming
president
tyler
had
not
deceived
them
and
thoroughly
soured
he
left
the
white
house
in
not
to
appear
in
public
life
again
until
the
days
of
secession
when
he
espoused

were
to
run
through
the
hour

before
the
whig
party
was
to
be
broken
and
scattered

the

had
been
more
than  generation
before
the

of

opinion
democracy
in

and
france
during
the
period
of

as
in
all
epochs
of
ferment
there
was  close
relation
between
the
thought
of
the
new
world
and
the
old
in
england
the
successes
of
the
american
experiment
were
used
as
arguments
in

of
overthrowing
the
aristocracy
which
george

had
manipulated
with
such
effect
against
america
half  century
before
in
the

on
the
other
hand
conservatives
like
chancellor
kent
the
stout
opponent
of
manhood
suffrage
in
new

cited
the
riots
of
the
british
working
classes
as  warning
against
admitting
the
same
classes
to  share
in
the
government
of
the
united

along
with
the
agitation
of
opinion
went

in

year
of

the
british
parliament
passed
its

bill
which
conferred
the
ballot
not
on
workingmen
as
yet
but
on
mill
owners
and
shopkeepers
whom
the
landlords
regarded
with
genuine
horror
the
initial
step
was
thus
taken
in
breaking
down

of

to
the

the

an
inspiration
conservatives
viewed

with
anxiety
liberals
with

sighted
leaders
could
see
that
the
tide
of

was
rising
all
over

and
could
not

naturally
the
country
that
had
advanced
furthest
along
the
new
course
was
the
place
in
which
to
find
arguments
for
and
against
proposals
that
europe
should
make
experiments
of
the
same
character
de
tocqueville  democracy
in
america
in
addition
to
the
casual
traveler
there
began
to
visit
the
united
states
the
thoughtful
observer
bent
on
finding
out
what
manner
of
nation
this
was
springing
up
in
the
wilderness
those
who
looked
with
sympathy
upon
the
growing
popular
forces
of
england
and
france
found
in
the

in
spite
of
many
blemishes
and
defects  guarantee
for
the
future
of
the
people  rule
in
the
old
world
one
of
these
alexis
de
tocqueville  french
liberal
of
mildly
democratic
sympathies
made  journey
to
this
country
in
he
described
in  very
remarkable
volume
democracy
in
america
the
grand
experiment
as
he
saw
it
on
the
whole
he
was
convinced
after
examining
with  critical
eye
the
life
and
labor
of
the
american
people
as
well
as
the
constitutions
of
the
states
and
the
nation
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
democracy
with
all
its
faults
was
both
inevitable
and
successful
slavery
he
thought
was  painful
contrast
to
the
other
features
of
american
life
and
he
foresaw
what
proved
to
be
the
irrepressible
conflict
over
it
he
believed
that
through
blundering
the
people
were
destined
to
learn
the
highest
of
all
arts
self
government
on  grand
scale
the
absence
of  leisure
class
devoted
to
no
calling
or
profession
merely
enjoying
the
refinements
of
life
and
adding
to
its
graces
the
flaw
in
american
culture
that
gave
deep
distress
to
many  european
leader
de
tocqueville
thought  necessary
virtue
in
the
republic
amongst  democratic
people
where
there
is
no
hereditary
wealth
every
man
works
to
earn  living
or
has
worked
or
is
born
of
parents
who
have
worked  notion
of
labor
is
therefore
presented
to
the
mind
on
every
side
as
the
necessary
natural
and
honest
condition
of
human
existence
it
was
this
notion
of  government
in
the
hands
of
people
who
labored
that
struck
the
french
publicist
as
the
most
significant
fact
in
the
modern
world
harriet
martineau  visit
to
america
this
phase
of
american
life
also
profoundly
impressed
the
brilliant
english
writer
harriet
martineau
she
saw
all
parts
of
the
country
the
homes
of
the
rich
and
the
log
cabins
of
the
frontier
she
traveled
in
stagecoaches
canal
boats
and
on
horseback
and
visited
sessions
of
congress
and
auctions
at
slave
markets
she
tried
to
view
the
country
impartially
and
the
thing
that
left
the
deepest
mark
on
her
mind
was
the
solidarity
of
the
people
in
one
great
political
body
however
various
may
be
the
tribes
of
inhabitants
in
those
states
whatever
part
of
the
world
may
have
been
their
birthplace
or
that
of
their
fathers
however
broken
may
be
their
language
however
servile
or
noble
their
employments
however
exalted
or
despised
their
state
all
are
declared
to
be
bound
together
by
equal
political
obligations
in
that
self
governing
country
all
are
held
to
have
an
equal
interest
in
the
principles
of
its
institutions
and
to
be
bound
in
equal
duty
to
watch
their
workings
miss
martineau
was
also
impressed
with
the
passion
of
americans
for
land
ownership
and
contrasted
the
united
states
favorably
with
england
where
the
tillers
of
the
soil
were
either
tenants
or
laborers
for
wages
adverse
criticism
by
no
means
all
observers
and
writers
were
convinced
that
america
was  success
the
fastidious
traveler
mrs
trollope
who
thought
the
english
system
of
church
and
state
was
ideal
saw
in
the
united
states
only
roughness
and
ignorance
she
lamented
the
total
and
universal
want
of
manners
both
in
males
and
females
adding
that
while
they
appear
to
have
clear
heads
and
active
intellects
there
was
no
charm
no
grace
in
their
conversation
she
found
everywhere  lack
of
reverence
for
kings
learning
and
rank
other
critics
were
even
more
savage
the
editor
of
the
foreign
quarterly
petulantly
exclaimed
that
the
united
states
was  brigand
confederation
charles
dickens
declared
the
country
to
be
so
maimed
and
lame
so
full
of
sores
and
ulcers
that
her
best
friends
turn
from
the
loathsome

still
more
from

and
the
old
world
to
the

over
against

to

these
yeomen
laid
out
farms
to
be

by

in

arkansas
below
missouri
lay
the
territory
of
arkansas
which
had
long
been
the
paradise
of
the
swarthy
hunter
and
the
restless
frontiersman
fleeing
from
the
advancing
borders
of
farm
and
town
in
search
of
the
life
wild
and
free
where
the
rifle
supplied
the
game
and  few
acres
of
ground
the
corn
and
potatoes
they
had
filtered
into
the
territory
in
an
unending
drift
squatting
on
the
land
without
so
much
as
asking
the
leave
of
any
government
territorial
or
national
they
claimed
as
their
own
the
soil
on
which
they
first
planted
their
feet
like
the
cherokee
indians
whom
they
had
as
neighbors
whose
very
customs
and
dress
they
sometimes
adopted
the
squatters
spent
their
days
in
the
midst
of
rough
plenty
beset
by
chills
fevers
and
the
ills
of
the
flesh
but
for
many
years
unvexed
by
political
troubles
or
the
restrictions
of
civilized
life
unfortunately
for
them
however
the
fertile
valleys
of
the
mississippi
and
arkansas
were
well
adapted
to
the
cultivation
of
cotton
and
tobacco
and
their
sylvan
peace
was
soon
broken
by
an
invasion
of
planters
the
newcomers
with
their
servile
workers
spread
upward
in
the
valley
toward
missouri
and
along
the
southern
border
westward
to
the
red
river
in
time
the
slaves
in
the
tier
of
counties
against
louisiana
ranged
from
thirty
to
seventy
per
cent
of
the
population
this
marked
the
doom
of
the
small
farmer
swept
arkansas
into
the
main
current
of
planting
politics
and
led
to  powerful
lobby
at
washington
in
favor
of
admission
to
the
union  boon
granted
in
michigan
in
accordance
with  well
established
custom  free
state
was
admitted
to
the
union
to
balance  slave
state
in
the
people
of
michigan  territory
ten
times
the
size
of
connecticut
announced
that
the
time
had
come
for
them
to
enjoy
the
privileges
of  commonwealth
all
along
the
southern
border
the
land
had
been
occupied
largely
by
pioneers
from
new
england
who
built
prim
farmhouses
and
adopted
the
town
meeting
plan
of
self
government
after
the
fashion
of
the
old
home
the
famous
post
of
detroit
was
growing
into  flourishing
city
as
the
boats
plying
on
the
great
lakes
carried
travelers
settlers
and
freight
through
the
narrows
in
all
according
to
the
census
there
were
more
than
ninety
thousand
inhabitants
in
the
territory
so
it
was
not
without
warrant
that
they
clamored
for
statehood
congress
busy
as
ever
with
politics
delayed
and
the
inhabitants
of
michigan
unable
to
restrain
their
impatience
called  convention
drew
up  constitution
and
started  lively
quarrel
with
ohio
over
the
southern
boundary
the
hand
of
congress
was
now
forced
objections
were
made
to
the
new
constitution
on
the
ground
that
it
gave
the
ballot
to
all
free
white
males
including
aliens
not
yet
naturalized
but
the
protests
were
overborne
in  long
debate
the
boundary
was
fixed
and
michigan
though
shorn
of
some
of
the
land
she
claimed
came
into
the
union
in
wisconsin
across
lake
michigan
to
the
west
lay
the
territory
of
wisconsin
which
shared
with
michigan
the
interesting
history
of
the
northwest
running
back
into
the
heroic
days
when
french
hunters
and
missionaries
were
planning  french
empire
for
the
great
monarch
louis
xiv
it
will
not
be
forgotten
that
the
french
rangers
of
the
woods
the
black
robed
priests
prepared
for
sacrifice
even
to
death
the
trappers
of
the
french
agencies
and
the
french
explorers
marquette
joliet
and
menard
were
the
first
white
men
to
paddle
their
frail
barks
through
the
northern
waters
they
first
blazed
their
trails
into
the
black
forests
and
left
traces
of
their
work
in
the
names
of
portages
and
little
villages
it
was
from
these
forests
that
red
men
in
full
war
paint
journeyed
far
to
fight
under
the
fleur
de
lis
of
france
when
the
soldiers
of
king
louis
made
their
last
stand
at
quebec
and
montreal
against
the
imperial
arms
of
britain
it
was
here
that
the
british
flag
was
planted
in
and
that
the
great
pontiac
conspiracy
was
formed
two
years
later
to
overthrow
british
dominion
when  generation
afterward
the
stars
and
stripes
supplanted
the
union
jack
the
french
were
still
almost
the
only
white
men
in
the
region
they
were
soon
joined
by
hustling
yankee
fur
traders
who
did
battle
royal
against
british
interlopers
the
traders
cut
their
way
through
forest
trails
and
laid
out
the
routes
through
lake
and
stream
and
over
portages
for
the
settlers
and
their
families
from
the
states
back
east
it
was
the
forest
ranger
who
discovered
the
water

later
used
to
turn
the
busy
mills

the
grain
from
the
spreading

in
the

of
the

in
clearing

they
spread

from

with

they
turned
to

on
the

building
before
three
prosperous
centers
of

dubuque
davenport
and
burlington
true
to
their
old

they
founded

be
cherished
on

wisconsin
it
had
been

by

and
the

was
the
little
french
village
of
mendota
to
the

the

were
first
revealed
by
the
historic
journey
of

by

were

to

three

the
uniformity
of

there
was  certain
monotony
about
pioneering
in
the
northwest
and
on
the
middle
border
as
the
long
stretches
of
land
were
cleared
or
prepared
for

they
were
laid
out
like
checkerboards
into

there
was  striking
uniformity
also
about
the
endless
succession
of
fertile
fields
spreading
far
and
wide
under
the
hot
summer
sun
no
majestic
mountains
relieved
the
sweep
of

few
monuments
of

were
there
to
awaken
curiosity
about

no

rang
out

the
chaffering

passed
farther
on
the

made
up
of

engaged
in
severe
and
unbroken
labor
chopping
down

breeding

breaking

and

from

the

nearly
all

into

lives
the

fitted
on

even
the

fell
before

happiness

despair

were
there

all
encompassed
by
the
heavy
tedium
of
prosaic
sameness

in

were
to
lead

was
under

the
setting
for
this
new
scene
in
the

movement
was
thrown
out
in  wide
sweep
from

to
the

from

to
montana
and
the
pacific

in
comparison
with
the
middle

this
region
presented
such
startling
diversities
that
only
the
eye
of
faith
could
foresee
the
unifying
power
of
nationalism
binding
its
communities
with
the
older
sections
of
the
country
what
contrasts
indeed
the
blue

region
of
kentucky
or
the
rich
black

of
illinois
the
painted
desert
the
home
of
the

were
signs
of
an
ancient
civilization
fragments
of
four

five
story
dwellings
ruined
dams
aqueducts
and
broken
canals
which
told
of
once
prosperous
peoples
who
by
art

science
had
conquered
the
aridity
of
the
desert
and
lifted
themselves
in
the
scale
of
culture
above
the
savages
of
the
plain
the
settlers
of
this
vast
empire
were
to
be
as
diverse
in
their
origins
and
habits
as
those
of
the
colonies
on

had
been
americans
of

usual
from

to

were
added
the
migratory

as
well
now
for

throngs
of
scandinavians
some
were
to
make
their
homes
on

for
the
self

accorded
to
states
as
soon
as  few
thousand
settlers
came
together
in  single
territory
there
arose  mighty
shout
for  position
beside
the
staid
commonwealths
of
the
east
and
the
south
statehood
meant
to
the
pioneers
self

dignity
and
the
right
to
dispose
of
land

and

in
their
own
way
in
the
quest
for
this
local

there
arose
many  wordy
contest
in

each
of
the
political

lending  helping

in
the
admission
of  state
when
it
gave

of
adding

to
use
the
current

southern

while
the
farmers
of
the
north
found
the
broad
acres
of
the
western
prairies
stretching
on
before
them
apparently
in
endless
expanse
it
was
far
different
with
the
southern
planters
ever
active
in
their
search
for
new
fields
as
they
exhausted
the
virgin
soil
of
the
older
states
the
restless
subjects
of
king
cotton
quickly
reached
the
frontier
of
louisiana
there
they
paused
but
only
for  moment
the
fertile
land
of
texas
just
across
the
boundary
lured
them
on
and
the
mexican
republic
to
which
it
belonged
extended
to
them  more
than
generous
welcome
little
realizing
the
perils
lurking
in  peaceful
penetration
the
authorities
at
mexico
city
opened
wide
the
doors
and
made
large

some
twenty

closes
the

the
government
of

unaccustomed
to
such
enterprise
and
thoroughly
frightened
by
its
extent
drew
back
in
dismay
its
fears
were
increased
as
quarrels
broke
out
between
the
americans
and
the
natives
in

fear
grew
into
consternation
when
efforts
were
made
by

to
buy
the

for
the

mexico
then
sought
to
close
the
flood
gates
it
stopped
all
american
colonization
schemes
canceled
many
of
the
land
grants
put  tariff
on

implements
and
abolished

these
barriers
were
raised
too
late  call
for

ran
through
the
western

of

the

rushed
to
the
aid
of
their
countrymen
in
texas
unacquainted
with
the
niceties
of
diplomacy
impatient
at
the
formalities
of
international
law
they
soon
made
it
known
that
in
spite
of
mexican
sovereignty
they
would
be
their
own
masters
the
independence
of
texas
declared
numbering
only
about
one
fourth
of
the
population
in
texas
they
raised
the
standard
of
revolt
in
and
summoned  convention
following
in
the
footsteps
of
their
ancestors
they
issued  declaration
of
independence
signed
mainly
by
americans
from
the
slave
states
anticipating
that
the
government
of
mexico
would
not
quietly
accept
their
word
of
defiance
as
final
they
dispatched  force
to
repel
the
invading
army
as
general
houston
called
the
troops
advancing
under
the
command
of
santa
ana
the
mexican
president  portion
of
the
texan
soldiers
took
their
stand
in
the
alamo
an
old
spanish
mission
in
the
cottonwood
trees
in
the
town
of
san
antonio
instead
of
obeying
the
order
to
blow
up
the
mission
and
retire
they
held
their
ground
until
they
were
completely
surrounded
and
cut
off
from
all
help
refusing
to
surrender
they
fought
to
the
bitter
end
the
last
man
falling  victim
to
the
sword
vengeance
was
swift
within
three
months
general
houston
overwhelmed
santa
ana
at
the
san
jacinto
taking
him
prisoner
of
war
and
putting
an
end
to
all
hopes
for
the
restoration
of
mexican
sovereignty
over
texas
the
lone
star
republic
with
houston
at
the
head
then
sought
admission
to
the
united
states
this
seemed
at
first
an
easy
matter
all
that
was
required
to
bring
it
about
appeared
to
be  treaty
annexing
texas
to
the

the

the
ostensible
cause

pressed
it
upon
the

polk
speedily
chose
this
way
out
of
the
dilemma
instead
of
making
the
decision
himself
however
and
drawing
up  treaty
he
turned
to
the
senate
for
counsel
as
prearranged
with
party
leaders
the
advice
was
favorable
to
the
plan
the

duly
drawn

power
who
gave
direction
to
the
redemption
of

the
management
of

and
the
upbuilding
of

he
promised
them
to
make
the

blossom
as

and
verily
he
did
it
he
firmly
shaped
the
enterprise
of
the

down
the

land
was
given
outright
to

great
care
was
exercised
in

so
that
none
should
have
great
advantage
over

the

surmounted
the

obstacles
with
astounding
skill
they
built

long
remained
the

bent
their

the
swift
movement
of
cotton
and
tobacco
to
the
north
or
to
seaports
was
of
common
concern
to
planters
and
manufacturers
accordingly
lines
were
flung
down
along
the
southern
coast
linking
richmond
charleston
and
savannah
with
the
northern
markets
other
lines
struck

giving  rail

in

in

the

it

still
they
were

it
did
the

reaching
out
to
the
very
borders
of
the
country
could
not
fail
to
bring
in
its
train
consequences
of  striking
character
some
were
immediate
and
obvious
others
require  fullness
of
time
not
yet
reached
to
reveal
their
complete
significance
outstanding
among
them
was
the
growth
of
an
industrial
population
detached
from
the
land
concentrated
in
cities
and
to
use
jefferson  phrase
dependent
upon
the
caprices
and
casualties
of
trade
for  livelihood
this
was  result
as
the
great
virginian
had
foreseen
which
flowed
inevitably
from
public
and
private
efforts
to
stimulate
industry
as
against
agriculture
illustration
lowell
massachusetts
in
an
early
industrial
town
it
was
estimated
in
on
the
basis
of
the
census
figures
that
mechanical
production
gave
employment
to
men
and
women
making
if
the
average
number
of
dependents
upon
them
be
reckoned
nearly
six
million
people
or
about
one
sixth
of
the
population
of
the
country
sustained
from
manufactures
this
runs
the
official
record
was
exclusive
of
the
number
engaged
in
the
production
of
many
of
the
raw
materials
and
of
the
food
for
manufacturers
in
the
distribution
of
their
products
such
as
merchants
clerks
draymen
mariners
the
employees
of

expresses
and
steamboats
of

various
artistic
and
professional
classes
as
well
as
carpenters
bricklayers
painters
and
the
members
of
other
mechanical
trades
not
classed
as
manufactures
it
is
safe
to
assume
then
that
one
third
of
the
whole
population
is
supported
directly
or
indirectly
by
manufacturing
industry
taking
however
the
number
of
persons
directly
supported
by
manufactures
namely
about
six
millions
reveals
the
astounding
fact
that
the
white
laboring
population
divorced
from
the
soil
already
exceeded
the
number
of
slaves
on
southern
farms
and
plantations
immigration
the
more
carefully
the
rapid
growth
of
the
industrial
population
is
examined
the
more
surprising
is
the
fact
that
such
an
immense
body
of
free
laborers
could
be
found
particularly
when
it
is
recalled
to
what
desperate
straits
the
colonial
leaders
were
put
in
securing
immigrants
slavery
indentured
servitude
and
kidnapping
being
the
fruits
of
their
necessities
the
answer
to
the
enigma
is
to
be
found
partly
in
european
conditions
and
partly
in
the
cheapness
of
transportation
after
the
opening
of
the
era
of
steam
navigation
shrewd
observers
of
the
course
of
events
had
long
foreseen
that  flood
of
cheap
labor
was
bound
to
come
when
the
way
was
made
easy
some
among
them
chief
justice
ellsworth
went
so
far
as
to
prophesy
that
white
labor
would
in
time
be
so
abundant
that
slavery
would
disappear
as
the
more
costly
of
the
two
labor
systems
the
processes
of

aided
by
the

the

the
opposition

the

until
indicted
seven
years
later
for

during
the
twenties

thirties
local
labor
unions
sprang
up
in
all

they
led
almost
immediately
to
city
federations
of
the
several

as
the
thousands
who
were
dependent
upon
their
daily
labor
for

mounted
into

millions

spread
across

the
local

of

grew
into
national

organizations
bound
together
by

half  century
had
to
elapse

was
to

all

forecasting

the
labor

seems
to
have

with
the
founding
of
the

free

in
philadelphia
in
and
the
establishment
of
the
new

workingman  advocate
shortly
afterward
these

followed
by
regular

designed
to
weld
together
and
advance
the

of

edited
by
able

these
little

with

wielded
an
enormous
influence
in
the
ranks
of
the
workers
labor
and
politics
as
for
the
political
program
of

the
main
planks
were
clear
and
specific
the
abolition
of

for

manhood
suffrage
in

where
property
qualifications
still
prevailed
free
and
universal

repeal
of

requiring

in

into
the

papers
and

there
sometimes
crept  note
of
hostility
to
the
masters

of
bitterness
that
excited
little
alarm

in

and
there
an
extremist
went
to
the
length
of
advocating
an
equal
division
of

among
all
the

the
crudest
kind
of

agitation
of
this
character
produced
in
labor
circles
profound
distrust
of
both

who
talked
principally
about

it
resulted
in
attempts
to
found
independent

candidates
were
put
up

at

got
into

triumphantly
exclaimed
the
mechanics
free

of
philadelphia
in
but
the
triumph
was
illusory
dissensions
appeared
in
the
labor
ranks
the
old

leaders
particularly
of
tammany
hall
the
democratic
party
organization
in
new
york
city
offered
concessions
to
labor
in
return
for
votes
newspapers
unsparingly
denounced
trade
union
politicians
as
demagogues
levellers
and
rag
tag
and
bobtail
and
some
of
them
deeming
labor
unrest
the
sour
fruit
of
manhood
suffrage
suggested
disfranchisement
as  remedy
under
the
influence
of
concessions
and
attacks
the
political
fever
quickly
died
away
and
the
end
of
the
decade
left
no
remnant
of
the
labor
political
parties
labor
leaders
turned
to  task
which
seemed
more
substantial
and
practical
that
of
organizing
workingmen
into
craft
unions
for
the
definite
purpose
of
raising
wages
and
reducing
hours
the
industrial
revolution
and
national
politics
southern
plans
for
union
with
the
west
it
was
long
the
design
of
southern
statesmen
like
calhoun
to
hold
the
west
and
the
south
together
in
one
political
party
the
theory
on
which
they
based
their
hope
was
simple
both
sections
were
agricultural
the
producers
of
raw
materials
and
the
buyers
of
manufactured
goods
the
planters
were
heavy
purchasers
of
western
bacon
pork
mules
and
grain
the
mississippi
river
and
its
tributaries
formed
the
natural
channel
for
the
transportation
of
heavy
produce
southward
to
the
plantations
and
outward
to
europe
therefore
ran
their
political
reasoning
the
interests
of
the
two
sections
were
one
by
standing
together
in
favor
of
low
tariffs
they
could
buy
their
manufactures
cheaply
in
europe
and
pay
for
them
in
cotton
tobacco
and
grain
the
union
of
the
two
sections
under
jackson  management
seemed
perfect
the
east
forms
ties
with
the
west
eastern
leaders
were
not
blind
to
the
ambitions
of
southern
statesmen
on
the
contrary
they
also
recognized
the
importance
of
forming
strong
ties
with
the
agrarian
west
and
drawing
the
produce
of
the
ohio
valley
to
philadelphia
and
new
york
the
canals
and
railways
were
the
physical
signs
of
this
economic
union
and
the
results
commercial
and
political
were
soon
evident
by
the
middle
of
the
century
southern
economists
noted
the
change
one
of
them
de
bow
lamenting
that
the
great
cities
of
the
north
have
severally
penetrated
the
interior
with
artificial
lines
until
they
have
taken
from
the
open
and
untaxed
current
of
the
mississippi
the
commerce
produced
on
its
borders
to
this
writer
it
was
an
astounding
thing
to
behold
the
number
of
steamers
that
now
descend
the
upper
mississippi
river
loaded
to
the
guards
with
produce
as
far
as
the
mouth
of
the
illinois
river
and
then
turn
up
that
stream
with
their
cargoes
to
be
shipped
to
new
york
via
chicago
the
illinois
canal
has
not
only
swept
the
whole
produce
along
the
line
of
the
illinois
river
to
the
east
but
it
is
drawing
the
products
of
the
upper
mississippi
through
the
same
channel
thus
depriving
new
orleans
and
st
louis
of  rich
portion
of
their
former
trade
if
to
any
shippers
the
broad
current
of
the
great
river
sweeping
down
to
new
orleans
offered
easier
means
of
physical
communication
to
the
sea
than
the
canals
and
railways
the
difference
could
be
overcome
by
the
credit
which
eastern
bankers
were
able
to
extend
to
the
grain
and
produce
buyers
in
the
first
instance
and
through
them
to
the
farmers
on
the
soil
the
acute
southern
observer
just
quoted
de
bow
admitted
with
evident
regret
in
that
last
autumn
the
rich
regions
of
ohio
indiana
and
illinois
were
flooded
with
the
local
bank
notes
of
the
eastern
states
advanced
by
the
new
york
houses
on
produce
to
be
shipped
by
way
of
the
canals
in

these
moneyed
facilities
enable
the
packer
miller
and
speculator
to
hold
on
to
their
produce
until
the
opening
of
navigation
in
the
spring
and
they
are
no
longer
obliged
as
formerly
to
hurry
off
their
shipments
during
the
winter
by
the
way
of
new
orleans
in
order
to
realize
funds
by
drafts
on
their
shipments
the
banking
facilities
at
the
east
are
doing
as
much
to
draw
trade
from
us
as
the
canals
and
railways
which
eastern
capital
is
constructing
thus
canals
railways
and
financial
credit
were
swiftly
forging
bonds
of
union
between
the
old
home
of
jacksonian
democracy
in
the
west
and
the
older
home
of
federalism
in
the
east
the
nationalism
to
which
webster
paid
eloquent
tribute
became
more
and
more
real
with
the
passing
of
time
the
self
sufficiency
of
the
pioneer
was
broken
down
as
he
began
to
watch
the
produce
markets
of
new
york
and
philadelphia
where
the
prices
of
corn
and
hogs
fixed
his
earnings
for
the
year
the
west
and
manufactures
in
addition
to
the
commercial
bonds
between
the
east
and
the
west
there
was
growing
up  common
interest
in
manufactures
as
skilled
white
labor
increased
in
the
ohio
valley
the
industries
springing
up
in
the
new
cities
made
western
life
more
like
that
of
the
industrial
east
than
like
that
of
the
planting
south
moreover
the
western
states
produced
some
important
raw
materials
for
american
factories
which
called
for
protection
against
foreign
competition
notably
wool
hemp
and
flax
as
the
south
had
little
or
no
foreign
competition
in
cotton
and
tobacco
the
east
could
not
offer
protection
for
her
raw
materials
in
exchange
for
protection
for
industries
with
the
west
however
it
became
possible
to
establish
reciprocity
in
tariffs
that
is
for
example
to
trade  high
rate
on
wool
for  high
rate
on
textiles
or
iron
the
south
dependent
on
the
north
while
east
and
west
were
drawing
together
the
distinctions
between
north
and
south
were
becoming
more
marked
the
latter
having
few
industries
and
producing
little
save
raw
materials
was
being
forced
into
the
position
of  dependent
section
as  result
of
the
protective
tariff
southern
planters
were
compelled
to
turn
more
and
more
to
northern
mills
for
their
cloth
shoes
hats
hoes
plows
and
machinery
nearly
all
the
goods
which
they
bought
in
europe
in
exchange
for
their
produce
came
overseas
to
northern
ports
whence
transshipments
were
made
by
rail
and
water
to
southern
points
of
distribution
their
rice
cotton
and
tobacco
in
as
far
as
they
were
not
carried
to
europe
in
british
bottoms
were
transported
by
northern
masters
in
these
ways  large
part
of
the
financial
operations
connected
with
the
sale
of
southern
produce
and
the
purchase
of
goods
in
exchange
passed
into
the
hands
of
northern
merchants
and
bankers
who
naturally
made
profits
from
their
transactions
finally
southern
planters
who
wanted
to
buy
more
land
and
more
slaves
on
credit
borrowed
heavily
in
the
north
where
huge
accumulations
made
the
rates
of
interest
lower
than
the
smaller
banks
of
the
south
could
afford
the
south
reckons
the
cost
of
economic
dependence
as
southern
dependence
upon
northern
capital
became
more
and
more
marked
southern
leaders
began
to
chafe
at
what
they
regarded
as
restraints
laid
upon
their
enterprise
in  word
they
came
to
look
upon
the
planter
as  tribute
bearer
to
the
manufacturer
and
financier
the
south
expostulated
de
bow
stands
in
the
attitude
of
feeding  vast
population
of
northern
merchants
shipowners
capitalists
and
others
who
without
claims
on
her
progeny
drink
up
the
life
blood
of
her
trade
where
goes
the
value
of
our
labor
but
to
those
who
taking
advantage
of
our
folly
ship
for
us
buy
for
us
sell
to
us
and
after
turning
our
own
capital
to
their
profitable
account
return
laden
with
our
money
to
enjoy
their
easily
earned
opulence
at
home
southern
statisticians
not
satisfied
with
generalities
attempted
to
figure
out
how
great
was
this
tribute
in
dollars
and
cents
they
estimated
that
the
planters
annually
lent
to
northern
merchants
the
full
value
of
their
exports  hundred
millions
or
more
to
be
used
in
the
manipulation
of
foreign
imports
they
calculated
that
no
less
than
forty
millions
all
told
had
been
paid
to
shipowners
in
profits
they
reckoned
that
if
the
south
were
to
work
up
her
own
cotton
she
would
realize
from
seventy
to
one
hundred
millions  year
that
otherwise
went
north
finally
to
cap
the
climax
they
regretted
that
planters
spent
some
fifteen
millions  year
pleasure
seeking
in
the
alluring
cities
and
summer
resorts
of
the
north
southern
opposition
to
northern
policies
proceeding
from
these
premises
southern
leaders
drew
the
logical
conclusion
that
the
entire
program
of
economic
measures
demanded
in
the
north
was
without
exception
adverse
to
southern
interests
and
by  similar
chain
of
reasoning
injurious
to
the
corn
and
wheat
producers
of
the
west
cheap
labor
afforded
by
free
immigration  protective
tariff
raising
prices
of
manufactures
for
the
tiller
of
the
soil
ship
subsidies
increasing
the
tonnage
of
carrying
trade
in
northern
hands
internal
improvements
forging
new
economic
bonds
between
the
east
and
the
west  national
banking
system
giving
strict
national
control
over
the
currency
as  safeguard
against
paper
inflation
all
these
devices
were
regarded
in
the
south
as
contrary
to
the
planting
interest
they
were
constantly
compared
with
the
restrictive
measures
by
which
great
britain
more
than
half  century
before
had
sought
to
bind
american
interests
as
oppression
justified  war
for
independence
once
statesmen
argued
so
it
can
justify
it
again
it
is
curious
as
it
is
melancholy
and
distressing
came  broad
hint
from
south
carolina
to
see
how
striking
is
the
analogy
between
the
colonial
vassalage
to
which
the
manufacturing
states
have
reduced
the
planting
states
and
that
which
formerly
bound
the
anglo
american
colonies
to
the
british
empire
england
said
to
her
american
colonies
you
shall
not
trade
with
the
rest
of
the
world
for
such
manufactures
as
are
produced
in
the
mother
country
the
manufacturing
states
say
to
their
southern
colonies
you
shall
not
trade
with
the
rest
of
the
world
for
such
manufactures
as
we
produce
the
conclusion
was
inexorable
either
the
south
must
control
the
national
government
and
its
economic
measures
or
it
must
declare
as
america
had
done
four
score
years
before
its
political
and
economic
independence
as
northern
mills
multiplied
as
railways
spun
their
mighty
web
over
the
face
of
the
north
and
as
accumulated
capital
rose
into
the
hundreds
of
millions
the
conviction
of
the
planters
and
their
statesmen
deepened
into
desperation
efforts
to
start
southern
industries
fail  few
of
them
seeing
the
predominance
of
the
north
made
determined
efforts
to
introduce
manufactures
into
the
south
to
the
leaders
who
were
averse
to
secession
and
nullification
this
seemed
the
only
remedy
for
the
growing
disparity
in
the
power
of
the
two
sections
societies
for
the
encouragement
of
mechanical
industries
were
formed
the
investment
of
capital
was
sought
and
indeed  few
mills
were
built
on
southern
soil
the
results
were
meager
the
natural
resources
coal
and
water
power
were
abundant
but
the
enterprise
for
direction
and
the
skilled
labor
were
wanting
the
stream
of
european
immigration
flowed
north
and
west
not
south
the
irish
or
german
laborer
even
if
he
finally
made
his
home
in  city
had
before
him
while
in
the
north
the
alternative
of  homestead
on
western
land
to
him
slavery
was  strange
if
not  repelling
institution
he
did
not
take
to
it
kindly
nor
care
to
fix
his
home
where
it
flourished
while
slavery
lasted
the
economy
of
the
south
was
inevitably
agricultural
while
agriculture
predominated
leadership
with
equal
necessity
fell
to
the
planting
interest
while
the
planting
interest
ruled
political
opposition
to
northern
economy
was
destined
to
grow
in
strength
the
southern
theory
of
sectionalism
in
the
opinion
of
the
statesmen
who
frankly
represented
the
planting
interest
the
industrial
system
was
its
deadly
enemy
their
entire
philosophy
of
american
politics
was
summed
up
in  single
paragraph
by
mcduffie  spokesman
for
south
carolina
owing
to
the
federative
character
of
our
government
the
great
geographical
extent
of
our
territory
and
the
diversity
of
the
pursuits
of
our
citizens
in
different
parts
of
the
union
it
has
so
happened
that
two
great
interests
have
sprung
up
standing
directly
opposed
to
each
other
one
of
these
consists
of
those
manufactures
which
the
northern
and
middle
states
are
capable
of
producing
but
which
owing
to
the
high
price
of
labor
and
the
high
profits
of
capital
in
those
states
cannot
hold
competition
with
foreign
manufactures
without
the
aid
of
bounties
directly
or
indirectly
given
either
by
the
general
government
or
by
the
state
governments
the
other
of
these
interests
consists
of
the
great
agricultural
staples
of
the
southern
states
which
can
find  market
only
in
foreign
countries
and
which
can
be
advantageously
sold
only
in
exchange
for
foreign
manufactures
which
come
in
competition
with
those
of
the
northern
and
middle
states
these
interests
then
stand
diametrically
and
irreconcilably
opposed
to
each
other
the
interest
the
pecuniary
interest
of
the
northern
manufacturer
is
directly
promoted
by
every
increase
of
the
taxes
imposed
upon
southern
commerce
and
it
is
unnecessary
to
add
that
the
interest
of
the
southern
planter
is
promoted
by
every
diminution
of
taxes
imposed
upon
the
productions
of
their
industry
if
under
these
circumstances
the
manufacturers
were
clothed
with
the
power
of
imposing
taxes
at
their
pleasure
upon
the
foreign
imports
of
the
planter
no
doubt
would
exist
in
the
mind
of
any
man
that
it
would
have
all
the
characteristics
of
an
absolute
and
unqualified
despotism
the
economic
soundness
of
this
reasoning  subject
of
interesting
speculation
for
the
economist
is
of
little
concern
to
the
historian
the
historical
point
is
that
this
opinion
was
widely
held
in
the
south
and
with
the
progress
of
time
became
the
prevailing
doctrine
of
the
planting
statesmen
their
antagonism
was
deepened
because
they
also
became
convinced
on
what
grounds
it
is
not
necessary
to
inquire
that
the
leaders
of
the
industrial
interest
thus
opposed
to
planting
formed  consolidated
aristocracy
of
wealth

upon
the
pursuit
and
attainment
of

james

the

of

after
he
had
watched
for
many
days
the
battle
royal
in

convention
of
exclaimed
that
the
contest
was
not
between
the
large

small
states
but
between
the
commercial
north
and
the
planting
south
from
the
inauguration
of
washington
to
the
election
of
lincoln
the
sectional
conflict
discerned
by
this
penetrating
thinker
exercised  profound
influence
on
the
course
of
american
politics
it
was
latent
during
the
era
of
good
feeling
when
the
jeffersonian
republicans
adopted
federalist
policies
it
flamed
up
in
the
contest
between
the
democrats
and

finally
it
raged
in

moreover
most
of

were
domestic

in

in
it

with

your
crime
wrote  distinguished
boston
clergyman
to
his
southern
brethren
and
we
will
share
with
you
the
burden
of
putting
an
end
to
it
we
will
consent
that
the
public
lands
shall
be
appropriated
to
this
object  deprecate
everything
which
sows
discord
and
exasperating
sectional
animosities
uncompromising
abolition
in  little
while
the
spirit
of
generosity
was
gone
just
as
jacksonian
democracy
rose
to
power
there
appeared  new
kind
of
anti
slavery
doctrine
the
dogmatism
of
the
abolition
agitator
for
mild
speculation
on
the
evils
of
the
system
was
substituted
an
imperious
and
belligerent
demand
for
instant
emancipation
if  date
must
be
fixed
for
its
appearance
the
year
may
be
taken
when
william
lloyd
garrison
founded
in
boston
his
anti
slavery
paper
the
liberator
with
singleness
of
purpose
and
utter
contempt
for
all
opposing
opinions
and
arguments
he
pursued
his
course
of
passionate
denunciation
he
apologized
for
having
ever
assented
to
the
popular
but
pernicious
doctrine
of
gradual
abolition
he
chose
for
his
motto
immediate
and
unconditional
emancipation
he
promised
his
readers
that
he
would
be
harsh
as
truth
and
uncompromising
as
justice
that
he
would
not
think
or
speak
or
write
with
moderation
then
he
flung
out
his
defiant
call  am
in
earnest  will
not
equivocate  will
not
excuse  will
not
retreat  single
inch
and  will
be
heard
such
is
the
vow  take
so
help
me
god
though
garrison
complained
that
the
apathy
of
the
people
is
enough
to
make
every
statue
leap
from
its
pedestal
he
soon
learned
how
alive
the
masses
were
to
the
meaning
of
his
propaganda
abolition
orators
were
stoned
in
the
street
and
hissed
from
the
platform
their
meeting
places
were
often
attacked
and
sometimes
burned
to
the
ground
garrison
himself
was
assaulted
in
the
streets
of
boston
finding
refuge
from
the
angry
mob
behind
prison
bars
lovejoy  publisher
in
alton
illinois
for
his
willingness
to
give
abolition  fair
hearing
was
brutally
murdered
his
printing
press
was
broken
to
pieces
as  warning
to
all
those
who
disturbed
the
nation  peace
of
mind
the
south
doubly
frightened
by  slave
revolt
in
which
ended
in
the
murder
of  number
of
men
women
and
children
closed
all
discussion
of
slavery
in
that
section
now
exclaimed
calhoun
it
is  question
which
admits
of
neither
concession
nor
compromise
as
the
opposition
hardened
the
anti

upon
the
espousal

ridiculed
and
excoriated
bondage
in
the
south
those
abolitionists
not
gifted
as
speakers
or
writers
signed
petitions
against
slavery
and
poured
them
in
upon
congress
the
flood
of
them
was
so
continuous
that
the
house
of
representatives
forgetting
its
traditions
adopted
in  gag
rule
which
prevented
the
reading
of
appeals
and
consigned
them
to
the
waste
basket
not
until
the
whigs
were
in
power
nearly
ten
years
later
was
john
quincy

able
after  relentless
campaign
to
carry  motion
rescinding
the
rule
how
deep
was
the
impression
made
upon
the
country
by
this
agitation
for
immediate
and
unconditional
emancipation
cannot
be
measured
if
the
popular
vote
for
those
candidates
who
opposed
not
slavery
but
its
extension
to
the
territories
be
taken
as  standard
it
was
slight
indeed
in
the
free
soil
candidate
birney
polled
votes
out
of
over  million
and  half
the
free
soil
vote
of
the
next
campaign
went
beyond  quarter
of  million
but
the
increase
was
due
to
the
strength
of
the
leader
martin
van
buren
four
years
afterward
it
receded
to
affording
all
the
outward
signs
for
the
belief
that
the
pleas
of
the
abolitionist
found
no
widespread
response
among
the
people
yet
the
agitation
undoubtedly
ran
deeper
than
the
ballot
box
young
statesmen
of
the
north
in
whose
hands
the
destiny
of
frightful
years
was
to
lie
found
their
indifference
to
slavery
broken
and
their
consciences
stirred
by
the
unending
appeal
and
the
tireless
reiteration
charles
sumner
afterward
boasted
that
he
read
the
liberator
two
years
before
wendell
phillips

young
boston
lawyer
who
cast
aside
his
profession
to
take
up
the
dangerous
cause
early
southern
opposition
to
slavery
in
the
south
the
sentiment
against
slavery
was
strong
it
led
some
to
believe
that
it
would
also
come
to
an
end
there
in
due
time
washington
disliked
it
and
directed
in
his
will
that
his
own
slaves
should
be
set
free
after
the
death
of
his
wife
jefferson
looking
into
the
future
condemned
the
system
by
which
he
also
lived
saying
can
the
liberties
of  nation
be
thought
secure
when
we
have
removed
their
only
firm
basis  conviction
in
the
minds
of
the
people
that
their
liberties
are
the
gift
of
god
are
they
not
to
be
violated
but
with
his
wrath
indeed  tremble
for
my
country
when  reflect
that
god
is
just
that
his
justice
cannot
sleep
forever
nor
did
southern
men
confine
their
sentiments
to
expressions
of
academic
opinion
they
accepted
in
the
ordinance
which
excluded
slavery
from
the
northwest
territory
forever
and
also
the
missouri
compromise
which
shut
it
out
of  vast
section
of
the
louisiana
territory
the
revolution
in
the
slave
system
among
the
representatives
of
south
carolina
and
georgia
however
the
anti
slavery
views
of
washington
and
jefferson
were
by
no
means
approved
and
the
drift
of
southern
economy
was
decidedly
in
favor
of
extending
and
perpetuating
rather
than
abolishing
the
system
of
chattel
servitude
the
invention
of
the
cotton
gin
and
textile
machinery
created  market
for
cotton
which
the
planters
with
all
their
skill
and
energy
could
hardly
supply
almost
every
available
acre
was
brought
under
cotton
culture
as
the
small
farmers
were
driven
steadily
from
the
seaboard
into
the
uplands
or
to
the
northwest
the
demand
for
slaves
to
till
the
swiftly
expanding
fields
was
enormous
the
number
of
bondmen
rose
from
in
washington  day
to
more
than
three
millions
in
at
the
same
time
slavery
itself
was
transformed
instead
of
the
homestead
where
the
same
family
of
masters
kept
the
same
families
of
slaves
from
generation
to
generation
came
the
plantation
system
of
the
far
south
and
southwest
where
masters
were
ever
moving
and
ever
extending
their
holdings
of
lands
and
slaves
this
in
turn
reacted
on
the
older
south
where
the
raising
of
slaves
for
the
market
became  regular
and
highly
profitable
business
illustration
from
an
old
print
john  calhoun
slavery
defended
as  positive
good
as
the
abolition
agitation
increased
and
the
planting
system
expanded
apologies
for
slavery
became
fainter
and
fainter
in
the
south
then
apologies
were
superseded
by
claims
that
slavery
was  beneficial
scheme
of
labor
control
calhoun
in  famous
speech
in
the
senate
in
sounded
the
new
note
by
declaring
slavery
instead
of
an
evil  good  positive
good
his
reasoning
was
as
follows
in
every
civilized
society
one
portion
of
the
community
must
live
on
the
labor
of
another
learning
science
and
the
arts
are
built
upon
leisure
the
african
slave
kindly
treated
by
his
master
and
mistress
and
looked
after
in
his
old
age
is
better
off
than
the
free
laborers
of
europe
and
under
the
slave
system
conflicts
between
capital
and
labor
are
avoided
the
advantages
of
slavery
in
this
respect
he
concluded
will
become
more
and
more
manifest
if
left
undisturbed
by
interference
from
without
as
the
country
advances
in
wealth
and
numbers
slave
owners
dominate
politics
the
new
doctrine
of
calhoun
was
eagerly
seized
by
the
planters
as
they
came
more
and
more
to
overshadow
the
small
farmers
of
the
south
and
as
they
beheld
the
menace
of
abolition
growing
upon
the
horizon
it
formed
as
they
viewed
matters  moral
defense
for
their
labor
system
sound
logical
invincible
it
warranted
them
in
drawing
together
for
the
protection
of
an
institution
so
necessary
so
inevitable
so
beneficent
though
in
the
slave
owners
were
only
about
three
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
in  national
population
of
nearly
twenty
million
whites
they
had
an
influence
all
out
of
proportion
to
their
numbers
they
were
knit
together
by
the
bonds
of  common
interest
they
had
leisure
and
wealth
they
could
travel
and
attend
conferences
and
conventions
throughout
the
south
and
largely
in
the
north
they
had
the
press
the
schools
and
the
pulpits
on
their
side
they
formed
as
it
were  mighty
union
for
the
protection
and
advancement
of
their
common
cause

by
those

and

exultantly
boasted  richmond
newspaper
the

this
jubilant
southern
claim
was
conceded
by
william  seward  republican
senator
from
new
york
in  speech
describing
the
power
of
slavery
in
the
national
government  party
he
said
is
in
one
sense  joint
stock
association
in
which
those
who
contribute
most
direct
the
action
and
management
of
the
concern
the
slaveholders
contributing
in
an
overwhelming
proportion
to
the
strength
of
the

and

its
policy

of

five
electors
of

and
vice
president
of

then
he
considered
the
slave
power
in
the
supreme
court
that
tribunal
he
exclaimed
consists
of  chief
justice
and
eight
associate
justices
of
these
five
were
called
from
slave
states
and
four
from
free
states
the
opinions
and
bias
of
each
of
them
were
carefully
considered
by
the
president
and
senate
when
he
was
appointed
not
one
of
them
was
found
wanting
in
soundness
of
politics
according
to
the
slaveholder  exposition
of
the
constitution
such
was
the
northern
view
of
the
planting
interest
that
from
the
arena
of
national
politics
challenged
the
whole
country
in
illustration
distribution
of
slaves
in
the
southern
states
slavery
in
national
politics
national
aspects
of
slavery
it
may
be
asked
why
it
was
that
slavery
founded
originally
on
state
law
and
subject
to
state
government
was
drawn
into
the
current
of
national
affairs
the
answer
is
simple
there
were
in
the
first
place
constitutional
reasons
the
congress
of
the
united
states
had
to
make
all
needful
rules
for
the
government
of
the
territories
the
district
of
columbia
the
forts
and
other
property
under
national
authority
so
it
was
compelled
to
determine
whether
slavery
should
exist
in
the
places
subject
to
its
jurisdiction
upon
congress
was
also
conferred
the
power
of
admitting
new
states
whenever  territory
asked
for
admission
the
issue
could
be
raised
as
to
whether
slavery
should
be
sanctioned
or
excluded
under
the
constitution
provision
was
made
for
the
return
of
runaway
slaves
congress
had
the
power
to
enforce
this
clause
by
appropriate
legislation
since
the
control
of
the
post
office
was
vested
in
the
federal
government
it
had
to
face
the
problem
raised
by
the
transmission
of
abolition
literature
through
the
mails
finally
citizens
had
the
right
of
petition
it
inheres
in
all
free
government
and
it
is
expressly
guaranteed
by
the
first
amendment
to
the
constitution
it
was
therefore
legal
for
abolitionists
to
present
to
congress
their
petitions
even
if
they
asked
for
something
which
it
had
no
right
to
grant
it
was
thus
impossible
constitutionally
to
draw  cordon
around
the
slavery
issue
and
confine
the
discussion
of
it
to
state
politics
there
were
in
the
second
place
economic
reasons
why
slavery
was
inevitably
drawn
into
the
national
sphere
it
was
the
basis
of
the
planting
system
which
had
direct
commercial
relations
with
the
north
and
european
countries
it
was
affected
by
federal
laws
respecting
tariffs
bounties
ship
subsidies
banking
and
kindred
matters
the
planters
of
the
south
almost
without
exception
looked
upon
the
protective
tariff
as  tribute
laid
upon
them
for
the
benefit
of
northern
industries
as
heavy
borrowers
of
money
in
the
north
they
were
generally
in
favor
of
easy
money
if
not
paper
currency
as
an
aid
in
the
repayment
of
their
debts
this
threw
most
of
them
into
opposition
to
the
whig
program
for  united
states
bank
all
financial
aids
to
american
shipping
they
stoutly
resisted
preferring
to
rely
upon
the
cheaper
service
rendered
by
english
shippers
internal
improvements
those
substantial
ties
that
were
binding
the
west
to
the
east
and
turning
the
traffic
from
new
orleans
to
philadelphia
and
new
york
they
viewed
with
alarm
free
homesteads
from
the
public
lands
which
tended
to
overbalance
the
south
by
building
free
states
became
to
them  measure
dangerous
to
their
interests
thus
national
economic
policies
which
could
not
by
any
twist
or
turn
be
confined
to
state
control
drew
the
slave
system
and
its
defenders
into
the
political
conflict
that
centered
at
washington
slavery
and
the
territories
the
missouri
compromise
though
men
continually
talked
about
taking
slavery
out
of
politics
it
could
not
be
done
by
slavery
had
become
so
entrenched
and
the
anti
slavery
sentiment
so
strong
that
missouri  quest
for
admission
brought
both
houses
of
congress
into  deadlock
that
was
broken
only
by
compromise
the
south
having
half
the
senators
could
prevent
the
admission
of
missouri
stripped
of
slavery
and
the
north
powerful
in
the
house
of
representatives
could
keep
missouri
with
slavery
out
of
the
union
indefinitely
an
adjustment
of
pretensions
was
the
last
resort
maine
separated
from
the
parent
state
of
massachusetts
was
brought
into
the
union
with
freedom
and
missouri
with
bondage
at
the
same
time
it
was
agreed
that
the
remainder
of
the
vast
louisiana
territory
north
of
the
parallel
of  should
be
like
the
old
northwest
forever
free
while
the
southern
portion
was
left
to
slavery
in
reality
this
was
an
immense
gain
for
liberty
the
area
dedicated
to
free
farmers
was
many
times
greater
than
that
left
to
the
planters
the
principle
was
once
more
asserted
that
congress
had
full
power
to
prevent
slavery
in
the
territories

territorial
question

the

henry

the
great
debate
of
the
temper
of
the
country
was
white
hot
when
congress
convened
in
december
it
was  memorable
session
memorable
for
the
great
men
who
took
part
in
the
debates
and
memorable
for
the
grand
compromise
of
which
it
produced
in
the
senate
sat
for
the
last
time
three
heroic
figures
webster
from
the
north
calhoun
from
the
south
and
clay
from  border
state
for
nearly
forty
years
these
three
had
been
leaders
of
men
all
had
grown
old
and
gray
in
service
calhoun
was
already
broken
in
health
and
in  few
months
was
to
be
borne
from
the
political
arena
forever
clay
and
webster
had
but
two
more
years
in
their
allotted
span
experience
learning
statecraft
all
these
things
they
now
marshaled
in  mighty
effort
to
solve
the
slavery
problem
on
january
clay
offered
to
the
senate  compromise
granting
concessions
to
both
sides
and  few
days
later
in  powerful
oration
he
made  passionate
appeal
for  union
of
hearts
through
mutual
sacrifices
calhoun
relentlessly
demanded
the
full
measure
of
justice
for
the
south
equal
rights
in
the
territories
bought
by
common
blood
the
return
of
runaway
slaves
as
required
by
the
constitution
the
suppression
of
the
abolitionists
and
the
restoration
of
the
balance
of
power
between
the
north
and
the
south
webster
in
his
notable
seventh
of
march
speech
condemned
the
wilmot
proviso
advocated  strict
enforcement
of
the
fugitive
slave
law
denounced
the
abolitionists
and
made  final
plea
for
the
constitution
union
and
liberty
this
was
the
address
which
called
forth
from
whittier
the
poem
ichabod
deploring
the
fall
of
the
mighty
one
whom
he
thought
lost
to
all
sense
of
faith
and
honor
the
terms
of
the
compromise
of
when
the
debates
were
closed
the
results
were
totaled
in  series
of
compromise
measures
all
of
which
were
signed
in
september
by
the
new
president
millard
fillmore
who
had
taken
office
two
months
before
on
the
death
of
zachary
taylor
by
these
acts
the
boundaries
of
texas
were
adjusted
and
the
territory
of
new
mexico
created
subject
to
the
provision
that
all
or
any
part
of
it
might
be
admitted
to
the
union
with
or
without
slavery
as
their
constitution
may
provide
at
the
time
of
their
admission
the
territory
of
utah
was
similarly
organized
with
the
same
conditions
as
to
slavery
thus
repudiating
the
wilmot
proviso
without
guaranteeing
slavery
to
the
planters
california
was
admitted
as  free
state
under  constitution
in
which
the
people
of
the
territory
had
themselves
prohibited
slavery
the
slave
trade
was
abolished
in
the
district
of
columbia
but
slavery
itself
existed
as
before
at
the
capital
of
the
nation
this
concession
to
anti
slavery
sentiment
was
more
than
offset
by  fugitive
slave
law
drastic
in
spirit
and
in
letter
it
placed
the
enforcement
of
its
terms
in
the
hands
of
federal
officers
appointed
from
washington
and
so
removed
it
from
the
control
of
authorities
locally
elected
it
provided
that
masters
or
their
agents
on
filing
claims
in
due
form
might
summarily
remove
their
escaped
slaves
without
affording
their
alleged
fugitives
the
right
of
trial
by
jury
the
right
to
witness
the
right
to
offer
any
testimony
in
evidence
finally
to
put
teeth
into
the
act
heavy
penalties
were
prescribed
for
all
who
obstructed
or
assisted
in
obstructing
the
enforcement
of
the
law
such
was
the
great
compromise
of
illustration
an
old

representing
webster
stealing
clay  thunder
the
pro
slavery
triumph
in
the
election
of
the
results
of
the
election
of
seemed
to
show
conclusively
that
the
nation
was
weary
of
slavery
agitation
and
wanted
peace
both
parties
whigs
and
democrats
endorsed
the
fugitive
slave
law
and
approved
the
great
compromise
the
democrats
with
franklin
pierce
as
their
leader
swept
the
country
against
the
war
hero
general
winfield
scott
on
whom
the
whigs
had
staked
their
hopes
even
webster
broken
with
grief
at
his
failure
to
receive
the
nomination
advised
his
friends
to
vote
for
pierce
and
turned
away
from
politics
to
meditate
upon
approaching
death
the
verdict
of
the
voters
would
seem
to
indicate
that
for
the
time
everybody
save  handful
of
disgruntled
agitators
looked
upon
clay  settlement
as
the
last
word
the
people
especially
the
business
men
of
the
country
says
elson
were
utterly
weary
of
the
agitation
and
they
gave
their
suffrages
to
the
party
that
promised
them
rest
the
free
soil
party
condemning
slavery
as  sin
against
god
and  crime
against
man
and
advocating
freedom
for
the
territories
failed
to
carry  single
state
in
fact
it
polled
fewer
votes
than
it
had
four
years
earlier
as
against
nearly
the
combined
vote
of
the
whigs
and
democrats
it
is
not
surprising
therefore
that
president
pierce
surrounded
in
his
cabinet
by
strong
southern
sympathizers
could
promise
to
put
an
end
to
slavery
agitation
and
to
crush
the
abolition
movement
in
the
bud
anti
slavery
agitation
continued
the
promise
was
more
difficult
to
fulfill
than
to
utter
in

the
vigorous
execution
of
one

included
in
the

the
fugitive

the
leader
in

fateful
enterprise
was
stephen  douglas
senator
from

and
the
occasion
for
the
deed
was
the
demand
for
the
organization
of
territorial
government
in
the
regions
west
of
iowa
and

douglas
like
clay
and
webster
before
him
was
consumed
by  strong
passion
for
the
presidency
and
to
reach
his
goal
it
was
necessary
to
win
the
support
of
the
south
this
he
undoubtedly
sought
to
do
when
he
introduced
on
january  bill
organizing
the
nebraska
territory
on
the
principle
of
the
compromise
of
namely
that
the
people
in
the
territory
might
themselves
decide
whether
they
would
have
slavery
or
not

avalanche
was
started
after  stormy
debate
in
which
important
amendments
were
forced
on
douglas
the
kansas
nebraska
bill
became  law
on
may
the
measure
created
two
territories
kansas

provided
that
they
or

organized
out
of
them
could
come
into
the

states
with
or
without
slavery
as
their
constitutions
may
prescribe
at
the
time
of
their
admission
not
content
with
this
the
law
went
on
to
declare
the
missouri
compromise
null
and
void
as
being
inconsistent
with
the
principle
of
non
intervention
by
congress
with

in
the
states
and

thus
by  single
blow
the
very
heart
of
the

vital
questions
of
the
day
this
was  reference
to

scott

by

into
the
upper
louisiana

freedom
had
been
established
by
the
missouri
compromise
and
then
carried
back
into
his
old
state

missouri
he
brought
suit
for
his
liberty
on
the
ground
that
his
residence
in
the
free
territory
made
him
free
this
raised
the
question
whether
the
law
of

prohibiting

north
of  was
authorized
by
the
federal
constitution

not
the
court
might
have
avoided
answering
it

saying
that
even
though
scott
was
free
in

he
became  slave
again
in

court
however
faced
the
issue
squarely
it
held
that
scott
had
not
been
free
anywhere
and
that
besides
the
missouri
compromise
violated
the
constitution
and
was
null
and
void
the
decision
was  triumph
for
the
south
it
meant
that
congress
after
all
had
no
power
to
abolish
slavery
in
the
territories
under
the
decree
of
the
highest
court
in

old
issue
was
again
vigorously
advanced
preparatory
to
the
next
presidential
campaign
the
lincoln
douglas
debates
the
following
year
the
interest
of
the
whole
country
was
drawn
to  series
of
debates
held
in
illinois
by
lincoln
and
douglas
both
candidates
for
the
united
states
senate
in
the
course
of
his
campaign
lincoln
had
uttered
his
trenchant
saying
that  house
divided
against
itself
cannot
stand  believe
this
government
cannot
endure
permanently
half
slave
and
half
free
at
the
same
time
he
had
accused
douglas
buchanan
and
the
supreme
court
of
acting
in
concert
to
make
slavery
national
this
daring
statement
arrested
the
attention
of
douglas
who
was
making
his
campaign
on
the
doctrine
of
squatter
sovereignty
that
is
the
right
of
the
people
of
each
territory
to
vote
slavery
up
or
down
after  few
long
distance
shots
at
each
other
the
candidates
agreed
to
meet
face
to
face
and
discuss
the
issues
of
the
day
never
had
such
crowds
been
seen
at
political
meetings
in
illinois
farmers
deserted
their
plows
smiths
their
forges
and
housewives
their
baking
to
hear
honest
abe
and
the
little
giant
the
results
of
the
series
of
debates
were
momentous
lincoln
clearly
defined
his
position
the
south
he
admitted
was
entitled
under
the
constitution
to  fair
fugitive
slave
law
he
hoped
that
there
might
be
no
new
slave
states
but
he
did
not
see
how
congress
could
exclude
the
people
of  territory
from
admission
as  state
if
they
saw
fit
to
adopt  constitution
legalizing
the
ownership
of
slaves
he
favored
the
gradual
abolition
of
slavery
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
the
total
exclusion
of
it
from
the
territories
of
the
united
states
by
act
of
congress
moreover
he
drove
douglas
into  hole
by
asking
how
he
squared
squatter
sovereignty
with
the
dred
scott
decision
how
in
other
words
the
people
of  territory
could
abolish
slavery
when
the
court
had
declared
that
congress
the
superior
power
could
not
do
it
under
the
constitution
to
this
baffling
question
douglas
lamely
replied
that
the
inhabitants
of  territory
by
unfriendly
legislation
might
make
property
in
slaves
insecure
and
thus
destroy
the
institution
this
answer
to
lincoln  query
alienated
many
southern
democrats
who
believed
that
the
dred
scott
decision
settled
the
question
of
slavery
in
the
territories
for
all
time
douglas
won
the
election
to
the
senate
but
lincoln
lifted
into
national
fame
by
the
debates
beat
him
in
the
campaign
for
president
two
years
later
john
brown  raid
to
the
abolitionists
the
line
of
argument
pursued
by
lincoln
including
his
proposal
to
leave
slavery
untouched
in
the
states
where
it
existed
was
wholly
unsatisfactory
one
of
them  grim
and
resolute
man
inflamed
by  hatred
for
slavery
in
itself
turned
from
agitation
to
violence
these
men
are
all
talk
what
is
needed
is
action
action
so
spoke
john
brown
of
new
york
during
the
sanguinary
struggle
in
kansas
he
hurried
to
the
frontier
gun
and
dagger
in
hand
to
help
drive
slave
owners
from
the
free
soil
of
the
west
there
he
committed
deeds
of
such
daring
and
cruelty
that
he
was
outlawed
and  price
put
upon
his
head
still
he
kept
on
the
path
of
action
aided
by
funds
from
northern
friends
he
gathered  small
band
of
his
followers
around
him
saying
to
them
if
god
be
for
us
who
can
be
against
us
he
went
into
virginia
in
the
autumn
of
hoping
as
he
explained
to
effect  mighty
conquest
even
though
it
be
like
the
last
victory
of
samson
he
seized
the
government
armory
at
harper  ferry
declared
free
the
slaves
whom
he
found
and
called
upon
them
to
take
up
arms
in
defense
of
their
liberty
his
was  hope
as
forlorn
as
it
was
desperate
armed
forces
came
down
upon
him
and
after  hard
battle
captured
him
tried
for
treason
brown
was
condemned
to
death
the
governor
of
virginia
turned  deaf
ear
to
pleas
for
clemency
based
on
the
ground
that
the
prisoner
was
simply  lunatic
this
is  beautiful
country
said
the
stern
old
brown
glancing
upward
to
the
eternal
hills
on
his
way
to
the
gallows
as
calmly
as
if
he
were
returning
home
from  long
journey
so
perish
all
such
enemies
of
virginia
all
such
enemies
of
the
union
all
such
foes
of
the
human
race
solemnly
announced
the
executioner
as
he
fulfilled
the
judgment
of
the
law
the
raid
and
its
grim
ending
deeply
moved
the
country
abolitionists
looked
upon
brown
as  martyr
and
tolled
funeral
bells
on
the
day
of
his
execution
longfellow
wrote
in
his
diary
this
will
be  great
day
in
our
history
the
date
of  new
revolution
as
much
needed
as
the
old
one
jefferson
davis
saw
in
the
affair
the
invasion
of  state
by  murderous
gang
of
abolitionists
bent
on
inciting
slaves
to
murder
helpless
women
and
children  crime
for
which
the
leader
had
met  felon  death
lincoln
spoke
of
the
raid
as
absurd
the
deed
of
an
enthusiast
who
had
brooded
over
the
oppression
of  people
until
he
fancied
himself
commissioned
by
heaven
to
liberate
them
an
attempt
which
ended
in
little
else
than
his
own
execution
to
republican
leaders
as  whole
the
event
was
very
embarrassing
they
were
taunted
by
the
democrats
with
responsibility
for
the
deed
douglas
declared
his
firm
and
deliberate
conviction
that
the
harper  ferry
crime
was
the
natural
logical
inevitable
result
of
the
doctrines
and
teachings
of
the
republican
party
so
persistent
were
such
attacks
that
the
republicans
felt
called
upon
in
to
denounce
brown  raid
as
among
the
gravest
of
crimes
the
democrats
divided
when
the
democratic
convention
met
at
charleston
in
the
spring
of  few
months
after
brown  execution
it
soon
became
clear
that
there
was
danger
ahead
between
the
extreme
slavery
advocates
of
the
far
south
and
the
so
called
pro
slavery
democrats
of
the
douglas
type
there
was  chasm
which
no
appeals
to
party
loyalty
could
bridge
as
the
spokesman
of
the
west
douglas
knew
that
while
the
north
was
not
abolitionist
it
was
passionately
set
against
an
extension
of
slavery
into
the
territories
by
act
of
congress
that
squatter
sovereignty
was
the
mildest
kind
of
compromise
acceptable
to
the
farmers
whose
votes
would
determine
the
fate
of
the
election
southern
leaders
would
not
accept
his
opinion
yancey
speaking
for
alabama
refused
to
palter
with
any
plan
not
built
on
the
proposition
that
slavery
was
in
itself
right
he
taunted
the
northern
democrats
with
taking
the
view
that
slavery
was
wrong
but
that
they
could
not
do
anything
about
it
that
he
said
was
the
fatal
error
the
cause
of
all
discord
the
source
of
black
republicanism
as
well
as
squatter
sovereignty
the
gauntlet
was
thus
thrown
down
at
the
feet
of
the
northern
delegates
you
must
not
apologize
for
slavery
you
must
declare
it
right
you
must
advocate
its
extension
the
challenge
so
bluntly
put
was
as
bluntly
answered
gentlemen
of
the
south
responded  delegate
from
ohio
you
mistake
us
you
mistake
us
we
will
not
do
it
for
ten
days
the
charleston
convention
wrangled
over
the
platform
and
balloted
for
the
nomination
of  candidate
douglas
though
in
the
lead
could
not
get
the
two
thirds
vote
required
for
victory
for
more
than
fifty
times
the
roll
of
the
convention
was
called
without  decision
then
in
sheer
desperation
the
convention
adjourned
to
meet
later
at
baltimore
when
the
delegates
again
assembled
their
passions
ran
as
high
as
ever
the
division
into
two
irreconcilable
factions
was
unchanged
uncompromising
delegates
from
the
south
withdrew
to
richmond
nominated
john  breckinridge
of
kentucky
for
president
and
put
forth  platform
asserting
the
rights
of
slave
owners
in
the
territories
and
the
duty
of
the
federal
government
to
protect
them
the
delegates
who
remained
at
baltimore
nominated
douglas
and
endorsed
his
doctrine
of
squatter
sovereignty
the
constitutional
union
party
while
the
democratic
party
was
being
disrupted  fragment
of
the
former
whig
party
known
as
the
constitutional
unionists
held  convention
at
baltimore
and
selected
national
candidates
john
bell
from
tennessee
and
edward
everett
from
massachusetts  melancholy
interest
attached
to
this
assembly
it
was
mainly
composed
of
old
men
whose
political
views
were
those
of
clay
and
webster
cherished
leaders
now
dead
and
gone
in
their
platform
they
sought
to
exorcise
the
evil
spirit
of
partisanship
by
inviting
their
fellow
citizens
to
support
the
constitution
of
the
country
the
union
of
the
states
and
the
enforcement
of
the
laws
the
party
that
campaigned
on
this
grand
sentiment
only
drew
laughter
from
the
democrats
and
derision
from
the
republicans
and
polled
less
than
one
fourth
the
votes
the
republican
convention
with
the
whigs
definitely
forced
into  separate
group
the
republican
convention
at
chicago
was
fated
to
be
sectional
in
character
although
five
slave
states
did
send
delegates
as
the
democrats
were
split
the
party
that
had
led  forlorn
hope
four
years
before
was
on
the
high
road
to
success
at
last
new
and
powerful
recruits
were
found
the
advocates
of  high
protective
tariff
and
the
friends
of
free
homesteads
for
farmers
and
workingmen
mingled
with
enthusiastic
foes
of
slavery
while
still
firm
in
their
opposition
to
slavery
in
the
territories
the
republicans
went
on
record
in
favor
of  homestead
law
granting
free
lands
to
settlers
and
approved
customs
duties
designed
to
encourage
the
development
of
the
industrial
interests
of
the
whole
country
the
platform
was
greeted
with
cheers
which
according
to
the
stenographic
report
of
the
convention
became
loud
and
prolonged
as
the
protective
tariff
and
homestead
planks
were
read
having
skillfully
drawn  platform
to
unite
the
north
in
opposition
to
slavery
and
the
planting
system
the
republicans
were
also
adroit
in
their
selection
of  candidate
the
tariff
plank
might
carry
pennsylvania  democratic
state
but
ohio
indiana
and
illinois
were
equally
essential
to
success
at
the
polls
the
southern
counties
of
these
states
were
filled
with
settlers
from
virginia
north
carolina
and
kentucky
who
even
if
they
had
no
love
for
slavery
were
no
friends
of
abolition
moreover
remembering
the
old
fight
on
the
united
states
bank
in
andrew
jackson  day
they
were
suspicious
of
men
from
the
east
accordingly
they
did
not
favor
the
candidacy
of
seward
the
leading
republican
statesman
and
favorite
son
of
new
york
after
much
trading
and
discussing
the
convention
came
to
the
conclusion
that
abraham
lincoln
of
illinois
was
the
most
available
candidate
he
was
of
southern
origin
born
in
kentucky
in  fact
that
told
heavily
in
the
campaign
in
the
ohio
valley
he
was  man
of
the
soil
the
son
of
poor
frontier
parents  pioneer
who
in
his
youth
had
labored
in
the
fields
and
forests
celebrated
far
and
wide
as
honest
abe
the
rail
splitter
it
was
well
known
that
he
disliked
slavery
but
was
no
abolitionist
he
had
come
dangerously
near
to
seward  radicalism
in
his
house
divided
against
itself
speech
but
he
had
never
committed
himself
to
the
reckless
doctrine
that
there
was  higher
law
than
the
constitution
slavery
in
the
south
he
tolerated
as  bitter
fact
slavery
in
the
territories
he
opposed
with
all
his
strength
of
his
sincerity
there
could
be
no
doubt
he
was  speaker
and
writer
of
singular
power
commanding
by
the
use
of
simple
and
homely
language
the
hearts
and
minds
of
those
who
heard
him
speak
or
read
his
printed
words
he
had
gone
far
enough
in
his
opposition
to
slavery
but
not
too
far
he

elaborated
by
lincoln

to
it
the

was
older
than

and
answerable
to

of

that

the

of
these

is
perpetual
ran
lincoln  simple
argument
in
the
first
inaugural
the
federal
constitution
has
no
provision
for
its
own
termination
it
can
be
destroyed
only
by
some
action
not
provided
for
in
the
instrument
itself
even
if
it
is  compact
among
all
the
states
the
consent
of
all
must
be
necessary
to
its
dissolution
therefore
no
state
can
lawfully
get
out
of
the
union
and
acts
of
violence
against
the
united
states
are
insurrectionary
or
revolutionary
this
was
the
system
which
he
believed
himself
bound
to
defend
by
his
oath
of
office
registered
in
heaven
all
this
reasoning
southern
statesmen
utterly
rejected
in
their
opinion
the
thirteen
original
states
won
their
independence
as
separate
and
sovereign
powers
the
treaty
of
peace
with
great
britain
named
them
all
and
acknowledged
them
to
be
free
sovereign
and
independent
states
the
articles
of
confederation
very
explicitly
declared
that
each
state
retains
its
sovereignty
freedom
and
independence
the
constitution
was  league
of
nations
formed
by
an
alliance
of
thirteen
separate
powers
each
one
of
which
ratified
the
instrument
before
it
was
put
into
effect
they
voluntarily
entered
the
union
under
the
constitution
and
voluntarily
they
could
leave
it
such
was
the
constitutional
doctrine
of
hayne
calhoun
and
jefferson
davis
in
seceding
the
southern
states
had
only
to
follow
legal
methods
and
the
transaction
would
be
correct
in
every
particular
so
conventions
were
summoned
elections
were
held
and
sovereign
assemblies
of
the
people
set
aside
the
constitution
in
the
same
manner
as
it
had
been
ratified
nearly
four
score
years
before
thus
said
the
southern
people
the
moral
judgment
was
fulfilled
and
the
letter
of
the
law
carried
into
effect

as  member

constitution
of
the
confederate

was
drafted
it
was
quickly
ratified
by
the
states
elections
were
held
in
november
and
the
government
under
it
went
into
effect
the
next
year
this
new
constitution
in
form
was
very
much
like
the
famous
instrument
drafted
at
philadelphia
in
it
provided
for  president  senate
and  house
of
representatives
along
almost
identical
lines
in
the
powers
conferred
upon
them
however
there
were
striking
differences
the
right
to
appropriate
money
for
internal
improvements
was
expressly
withheld
bounties
were
not
to
be
granted
from
the
treasury
nor
import
duties
so
laid
as
to
promote
or
foster
any
branch
of
industry
the
dignity
of
the
state
if
any
might
be
bold
enough
to
question
it
was
safeguarded
in
the
opening
line
by
the
declaration
that
each
acted
in
its
sovereign
and
independent
character
in
forming
the
southern
union
financing
the
confederacy
no
government
ever
set
out
upon
its
career
with
more
perplexing
tasks
in
front
of
it
the
north
had  monetary
system
the
south
had
to
create
one
the
north
had  scheme
of
taxation
that
produced
large
revenues
from
numerous
sources
the
south
had
to
formulate
and
carry
out  financial
plan
like
the
north
the
confederacy
expected
to
secure  large
revenue
from
customs
duties
easily
collected
and
little
felt
among
the
masses
to
this
expectation
the
blockade
of
southern
ports
inaugurated
by
lincoln
in
april
soon
put
an
end
following
the
precedent
set
by
congress
under
the
articles
of
confederation
the
southern
congress
resorted
to  direct
property
tax
apportioned
among
the
states
only
to
meet
the
failure
that
might
have
been
foretold
the
confederacy
also
sold
bonds
the
first
issue
bringing
into
the
treasury
nearly
all
the
specie
available
in
the
southern
banks
this
specie
by
unhappy
management
was
early
sent
abroad
to
pay
for
supplies
sapping
the
foundations
of  sound
currency
system
large
amounts
of
bonds
were
sold
overseas
commanding
at
first
better
terms
than
those
of
the
north
in
the
markets
of
london
paris
and
amsterdam
many
an
english
lord
and
statesman
buying
with
enthusiasm
and
confidence
to
lament
within  few
years
the
proofs
of
his
folly
the
difficulties
of
bringing
through
the
blockade
any
supplies
purchased
by
foreign
bond
issues
however
nullified
the
effect
of
foreign
credit
and
forced
the
confederacy
back
upon
the
device
of
paper
money
in
all
approximately
one
billion
dollars
streamed
from
the
printing
presses
to
fall
in
value
at
an
alarming
rate
reaching
in
january
the
astounding
figure
of
fifty
dollars
in
paper
money
for
one
in
gold
every
known
device
was
used
to
prevent
its
depreciation
without
result
to
the
issues
of
the
confederate
congress
were
added
untold
millions
poured
out
by
the
states
and
by
private
banks
human
and
material
resources
when
we
measure
strength
for
strength
in
those
signs
of
power
men
money
and
supplies
it
is
difficult
to
see
how
the
south
was
able
to
embark
on
secession
and
war
with
such
confidence
in
the
outcome
in
the
confederacy
at
the
final
reckoning
there
were
eleven
states
in
all
to
be
pitted
against
twenty
two  population
of
nine
millions
nearly
one
half
servile
to
be
pitted
against
twenty
two
millions  land
without
great
industries
to
produce
war
supplies
and
without
vast
capital
to
furnish
war
finances
joined
in
battle
with  nation
already
industrial
and
fortified
by
property
worth
eleven
billion
dollars
even
after
the
confederate
congress
authorized
conscription
in
southern
man
power
measured
in
numbers
was
wholly
inadequate
to
uphold
the
independence
which
had
been
declared
how
therefore
could
the
confederacy
hope
to
sustain
itself
against
such  combination
of
men
money
and
materials
as
the
north
could
marshal
southern
expectations
the
answer
to
this
question
is
to
be
found
in
the
ideas
that
prevailed
among
southern
leaders
first
of
all
they
hoped
in
vain
to
carry
the
confederacy
up
to
the
ohio
river
and
with
the
aid
of
missouri
to
gain
possession
of
the
mississippi
valley
the
granary
of
the
nation
in
the
second
place
they
reckoned
upon  large
and
continuous
trade
with
great
britain
the
exchange
of
cotton
for
war
materials
they
likewise
expected
to
receive
recognition
and
open
aid
from
european
powers
that
looked
with
satisfaction
upon
the
breakup
of
the
great
american
republic
in
the
third
place
they
believed
that
their
control
over
several
staples
so
essential
to
northern
industry
would
enable
them
to
bring
on
an
industrial
crisis
in
the
manufacturing
states  firmly
believe
wrote
senator
hammond
of
south
carolina
in
that
the
slave
holding
south
is
now
the
controlling
power
of
the
world
that
no
other
power
would
face
us
in
hostility
cotton
rice
tobacco
and
naval
stores
command
the
world
and
we
have
the
sense
to
know
it
and
are
sufficiently
teutonic
to
carry
it
out
successfully
the
north
without
us
would
be  motherless
calf
bleating
about
and
die
of
mange
and
starvation
there
were
other
grounds
for
confidence
having
seized
all
of
the
federal
military
and
naval
supplies
in
the
south
and
having
left
the
national
government
weak
in
armed
power
during
their
possession
of
the
presidency
southern
leaders
looked
to  swift
war
if
it
came
at
all
to
put
the
finishing
stroke
to
independence
the
greasy
mechanics
of
the
north
it
was
repeatedly
said
will
not
fight
as
to
disparity
in
numbers
they
drew
historic
parallels
our
fathers  mere
handful
overcame
the
enormous
power
of
great
britain  saying
of
ex
president
tyler
ran
current
to
reassure
the
doubtful
finally
and
this
point
cannot
be
too
strongly
emphasized
the
south
expected
to
see  weakened
and
divided
north
it
knew
that
the
abolitionists
and
the
southern
sympathizers
were
ready
to
let
the
confederate
states
go
in
peace
that
lincoln
represented
only  little
more
than
one
third
the
voters
of
the
country
and
that
the
vote
for
douglas
bell
and
breckinridge
meant  decided
opposition
to
the
republicans
and
their
policies
efforts
at
compromise
republican
leaders
on
reviewing
the
same
facts
were
themselves
uncertain
as
to
the
outcome
of  civil
war
and
made
many
efforts
to
avoid  crisis
thurlow

albany

and

who
had
done
much

for
extending
the
missouri
compromise
line
to
the
pacific
jefferson
davis
warning
his
followers
that  war
if
it
came
would
be
terrible
was
prepared
to
accept
the
offer
but
lincoln
remembering
his
campaign
pledges
stood
firm
as  rock
against
it
his
followers
in
congress
took
the
same
position
with
regard
to  similar
settlement
suggested
by
senator
crittenden
of
kentucky
though
unwilling
to
surrender
his
solemn
promises
respecting
slavery
in
the
territories
lincoln
was
prepared
to
give
to
southern
leaders  strong
guarantee
that
his
administration
would
not
interfere
directly
or
indirectly
with
slavery
in
the
states
anxious
to
reassure
the
south
on
this
point
the
republicans
in
congress
proposed
to
write
into
the
constitution  declaration
that
no
amendment
should
ever
be
made
authorizing
the
abolition
of
or
interference
with
slavery
in
any
state
the
resolution
duly
passed
was
sent
forth
on
march
with
the
approval
of
lincoln
it
was
actually
ratified
by
three
states
before
the
storm
of
war
destroyed
it
by
the
irony
of
fate
the
thirteenth
amendment
was
to
abolish
not
guarantee
slavery
the
war
measures
of
the
federal
government
raising
the
armies
the
crisis
at
fort
sumter
on
april
forced
the
president
and
congress
to
turn
from
negotiations
to
problems
of
warfare
little
did
they
realize
the
magnitude
of
the
task
before
them
lincoln  first
call
for
volunteers
issued
on
april
limited
the
number
to
put
their
term
of
service
at
three
months
and
prescribed
their
duty
as
the
enforcement
of
the
law
against
combinations
too
powerful
to
be
overcome
by
ordinary
judicial
process
disillusionment
swiftly
followed
the
terrible
defeat
of
the
federals
at
bull
run
on
july
revealed
the
serious
character
of
the
task
before
them
and
by  series
of
measures
congress
put
the
entire
man
power
of
the
country
at
the
president  command
under
these
acts
he
issued
new
calls
for
volunteers
early
in
august
he
ordered  draft
of
militiamen
numbering
for
nine
months
service
the
results
were
disappointing
ominous
for
only
about
soldiers
were
added
to
the
army
something
more
drastic
was
clearly
necessary
in
march
lincoln
signed
the
inevitable
draft
law
it
enrolled
in
the
national
forces
liable
to
military
duty
all
able
bodied
male
citizens
and
persons
of
foreign
birth
who
had
declared
their
intention
to
become
citizens
between
the
ages
of
twenty
and
forty
five
years
with
exemptions
on
grounds
of
physical
weakness
and
dependency
from
the
men
enrolled
were
drawn
by
lot
those
destined
to
active
service
unhappily
the
measure
struck  mortal
blow
at
the
principle
of
universal
liability
by
excusing
any
person
who
found  substitute
for
himself
or
paid
into
the
war
office  sum
not
exceeding
three
hundred
dollars
to
be
fixed
by
general
order
this
provision
so
crass
and
so
obviously
favoring
the
well
to
do
sowed
seeds
of
bitterness
which
sprang
up  hundredfold
in
the
north
illustration
the
draft
riots
in
new
york
city
the
beginning
of
the
drawings
under
the
draft
act
in
new
york
city
on
monday
july
was
the
signal
for
four
days
of
rioting
in
the
course
of
this
uprising
draft
headquarters
were
destroyed
the
office
of
the
tribune
was
gutted
negroes
were
seized
hanged
and
shot
the
homes
of
obnoxious
unionists
were
burned
down
the
residence
of
the
mayor
of
the
city
was
attacked
and
regular
battles
were
fought
in
the
streets
between
the
rioters
and
the
police
business
stopped
and  large
part
of
the
city
passed
absolutely
into
the
control
of
the
mob
not
until
late
the
following
wednesday
did
enough
troops
arrive
to
restore
order
and
enable
the
residents
of
the
city
to
resume
their
daily
activities
at
least  thousand
people
had
been
killed
or
wounded
and
more
than  million
dollars
worth
of
damage
done
to
property
the
draft
temporarily
interrupted
by
this
outbreak
was
then
resumed
and
carried
out
without
further
trouble
the
results
of
the
draft
were
in
the
end
distinctly
disappointing
to
the
government
the
exemptions
were
numerous
and
the
number
who
preferred
and
were
able
to
pay
rather
than
serve
exceeded
all
expectations
volunteering
it
is
true
was
stimulated
but
even
that
resource
could
hardly
keep
the
thinning
ranks
of
the
army
filled
with
reluctance
congress
struck
out
the
exemption
clause
but
still
favored
the
well
to
do
by
allowing
them
to
hire
substitutes
if
they
could
find
them
with
all
this
power
in
its
hands
the
administration
was
able
by
january
to
construct  union

that
outnumbered

to

war
finance
in
the
financial
sphere
the
north
faced
immense
difficulties
the
surplus
in
the
treasury
had
been
dissipated
by
and
the
tariff
of
had
failed
to
produce
an
income
sufficient
to
meet
the
ordinary
expenses
of
the
government
confronted
by
military
and
naval
expenditures
of
appalling
magnitude
rising
from
in
the
first
year
of
the
war
to
in
the
last
year
the
administration
had
to
tap
every
available
source
of
income
the
duties
on
imports
were
increased
not
once
but
many
times
producing
huge
revenues
and
also
meeting
the
most
extravagant
demands
of
the
manufacturers
for
protection
direct
taxes
were
imposed
on
the
states
according
to
their
respective
populations
but
the
returns
were
meager
all
out
of
proportion
to
the
irritation
involved
stamp
taxes
and
taxes
on
luxuries
occupations
and
the
earnings
of
corporations
were
laid
with  weight
that
in
ordinary
times
would
have
drawn
forth
opposition
of
ominous
strength
the
whole
gamut
of
taxation
was
run
even  tax
on

and
gains
by
the
year
the
first
in
the
history
of
the

in

were
supplemented
by

many
times
the

of
all
the

to
the

must
be
added
nearly
half  billion
dollars
in
greenbacks
paper
money
issued
by
congress
in
desperation
as
bond
sales
and
revenues
from
taxes
failed
to
meet
the
rising
expenditures
this
currency
issued
at
par
on
questionable
warrant
from
the
constitution
like
all
such
paper
quickly
began
to
decline
until
in
the
worst
fortunes
of

was
worth
nearly
three

the
blockade
of
southern
ports
four
days
after
his
call
for

april
president
lincoln
issued  proclamation
blockading
the
ports
of
the
southern

the
blockade
was
extended
to
virginia
and

as

to
the
nearest
convenient

order
effective
immediate
steps
were
taken
to
increase
the
naval
forces
depleted
by
neglect
until
the
entire

line
was
patrolled
with
such  number
of
ships
that
it
was  rare

who
ventured
to
run

the
collision
between
the
merrimac
and

in

sealed
the
fate
of
the
confederacy
the
exploits
of
the

are
recorded
in
the
falling
export
of
cotton
in
in
and
in
the
deadly
effect
of
this
paralysis
of
trade
upon
southern
war
power
may
be
readily
imagined
foreign
loans
payable
in
cotton
could
be
negotiated
but
not
paid
off
supplies
could
be
purchased
on
credit
but
not
brought
through

secure

at
the
loss
of

were
finally
driven
to
the
use

emancipation
among

adopted

must
be
counted
the
emancipation
of

in

in

against
the

this
step
was
early
and
repeatedly
suggested
to
lincoln
by
the
abolitionists
but
was
steadily
put
aside
he
knew
that
the
abolitionists
were  mere
handful
that
emancipation
might
drive
the
border
states
into
secession
and
that
the
northern
soldiers
had
enlisted
to
save
the

moreover
he
had
before
him  solemn
resolution
passed

the
sole
purpose
of

to
be
the
salvation
of

and

any
intention
of
interfering

the

though
pledged
to
the
preservation
of

soon
found
itself
beaten
back
upon
its
course
and
out
upon  new
tack
before  year
had
elapsed
namely
on

congress
resolved
that
financial
aid
should
be
given
to
any
state
that
might
adopt

six

were

up
his
mind
by

of
that
year
he
had
come
to
his
great
decision
near
the
end
of

he
read
to
his

the
draft
of  proclamation
of
emancipation
but
he
laid
it
aside
until  military
achievement
would
make
it
something
more
than
an
idle
gesture
in

the
severe

administered
to

returned
to

by

the
fatal
blow
at

peculiar
institution
would
be
delivered
southern
leaders
treated
it
with
slight
regard
and
so
on
the
date
set
the
promise
was
fulfilled
the
proclamation
was
issued
as  war
measure
adopted
by
the
president
as
commander
in

between

about

authorized
him
to
suspend

throughout

in

also
freed

lincoln

is
it  question
of

both

which

live
as
long
as
the

these
are
tributes
not

to
his

of

also
to
his
mastery
of
all
those
sentiments
of
sweetness
and
strength
which
are
the
finest
flowers
of
culture
throughout
the
entire
span
of
service
however
lincoln
was
beset
by
merciless
critics
the
fiery
apostles
of
abolition
accused
him
of
cowardice
when
he
delayed
the
bold
stroke
at

anti

put

we
may
never

man
was
lincoln  quiet
answer
wide
were
the
dissensions
in
the
north
during
that
year
and
the
republicans
while
selecting
lincoln
as
their
candidate
again
cast
off
their
old
name
and
chose
the
simple
title
of
the
union
party
moreover
they
selected  southern
man
andrew
johnson
of
tennessee
to
be
associated
with
him
as
candidate
for
vice
president
this
combination
the
northern
democrats
boldly
confronted
with  platform
declaring
that
after
four
years
of
failure
to
restore
the
union
by
the
experiment
of
war
during
which
under
the
pretence
of
military
necessity
or
war
power
higher
than
the
constitution
the
constitution
itself
has
been
disregarded
in
every
part
and
public
liberty
and
private
right
alike
trodden
down
justice
humanity
liberty
and
public
welfare
demand
that
immediate
efforts
be
made
for  cessation
of
hostilities
to
the
end
that
peace
may
be
restored
on
the
basis
of
the
federal
union
of
the
states
it
is
true
that
the
democratic
candidate
general
mcclellan
sought
to
break
the
yoke
imposed
upon
him
by
the
platform
saying
that
he
could
not
look
his
old
comrades
in
the
face
and
pronounce
their
efforts
vain
but
the
party
call
to
the
nation
to
repudiate
lincoln
and
his
works
had
gone
forth
the
response
came
giving
lincoln
votes
against
for
his
opponent
the
bitter
things
said
about
him
during
the
campaign
he
forgot
and
forgave
when
in
april
he
was
struck
down
by
the
assassin  hand
he
above
all
others
in
washington
was
planning
measures
of
moderation
and
healing
the
results
of
the
civil
war
there
is  strong
and
natural
tendency
on
the
part
of
writers
to
stress
the
dramatic
and
heroic
aspects
of
war
but
the
long
judgment
of
history
requires
us
to
include
all
other
significant
phases
as
well
like
every
great
armed
conflict
the
civil
war
outran
the
purposes
of
those
who
took
part
in
it
waged
over
the
nature
of
the
union
it
made  revolution
in
the
union
changing
public
policies
and
constitutional
principles
and
giving  new
direction
to
agriculture
and
industry
the
supremacy
of
the
union
first
and
foremost
the
war
settled
for
all
time
the
long
dispute
as
to
the
nature
of
the
federal
system
the
doctrine
of
state
sovereignty
was
laid
to
rest
men
might
still
speak
of
the
rights
of
states
and
think
of
their
commonwealths
with
affection
but
nullification
and
secession
were
destroyed
the
nation
was
supreme
the
destruction
of
the
slave
power
next
to
the
vindication
of
national
supremacy
was
the
destruction
of
the
planting
aristocracy
of
the
south
that
great
power
which
had
furnished
leadership
of
undoubted
ability
and
had
so
long
contested
with
the
industrial
and
commercial
interests
of
the
north
the
first
paralyzing
blow
at
the
planters
was
struck
by
the
abolition
of
slavery
the
second
and
third
came
with
the
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
amendments
giving
the
ballot
to
freedmen
and
excluding
from
public
office
the
confederate
leaders
driving
from
the
work
of
reconstruction
the
finest
talents
of
the
south
as
if
to
add
bitterness
to
gall
and
wormwood
the
fourteenth
amendment
forbade
the
united
states
or
any
state
to
pay
any
debts
incurred
in
aid
of
the
confederacy
or
in
the
emancipation
of
the
slaves
plunging
into
utter
bankruptcy
the
southern
financiers
who
had
stripped
their
section
of
capital
to
support
their
cause
so
the
southern
planters
found
themselves
excluded
from
public
office
and
ruled
over
by
their
former
bondmen
under
the
tutelage
of
republican
leaders
their
labor
system
was
wrecked
and
their
money
and
bonds
were
as
worthless
as
waste
paper
the
south
was
subject
to
the
north
that
which
neither
the
federalists
nor
the
whigs
had
been
able
to
accomplish
in
the
realm
of
statecraft
was
accomplished
on
the
field
of
battle
the
triumph
of
industry
the
wreck
of
the
planting
system
was
accompanied
by  mighty
upswing
of
northern
industry
which
made
the
old
whigs
of
massachusetts
and
pennsylvania
stare
in
wonderment
the
demands
of
the
federal
government
for
manufactured
goods
at
unrestricted
prices
gave  stimulus
to
business
which
more
than
replaced
the
lost
markets
of
the
south
between
and
the
number
of
manufacturing
establishments
increased
per
cent
as
against
for
the
previous
decade
while
the
number
of
persons
employed
almost
doubled
there
was
no
doubt
about
the
future
of
american
industry
the
victory
for
the
protective
tariff
moreover
it
was
henceforth
to
be
well
protected
for
many
years
before
the
war
the
friends
of
protection
had
been
on
the
defensive
the
tariff
act
of
imposed
duties
so
low
as
to
presage  tariff
for
revenue
only
the
war
changed
all
that
the
extraordinary
military
expenditures
requiring
heavy
taxes
on
all
sources
justified
tariffs
so
high
that  follower
of
clay
or
webster
might
well
have
gasped
with
astonishment
after
the
war
was
over
the
debt
remained
and
both
interest
and
principal
had
to
be
paid
protective
arguments
based
on
economic
reasoning
were
supported
by  plain
necessity
for
revenue
which
admitted
no
dispute  liberal
immigration
policy
linked
with
industry
was
the
labor
supply
the
problem
of
manning
industries
became  pressing
matter
and
republican
leaders
grappled
with
it
in
the
platform
of
the
union
party
adopted
in
it
was
declared
that
foreign
immigration
which
in
the
past
has
added
so
much
to
the
wealth
the
development
of
resources
and
the
increase
of
power
to
this
nation
the
asylum
of
the
oppressed
of
all
nations
should
be
fostered
and
encouraged
by  liberal
and
just
policy
in
that
very
year
congress
recognizing
the
importance
of
the
problem
passed  measure
of
high
significance
creating  bureau
of
immigration
and
authorizing  modified
form
of
indentured
labor
by
making
it
legal
for
immigrants
to
pledge
their
wages
in
advance
to
pay
their
passage
over
though
the
bill
was
soon
repealed
the
practice
authorized
by
it
was
long
continued
the
cheapness
of
the
passage
shortened
the
term
of
service
but
the
principle
was
older
than
the
days
of
william
penn
the
homestead
act
of
in
the
immigration
measure
guaranteeing  continuous
and
adequate
labor
supply
the
manufacturers
saw
an
offset
to
the
homestead
act
of
granting
free
lands
to
settlers
the
homestead
law
they
had
resisted
in  long
and
bitter
congressional
battle
naturally
they
had
not
taken
kindly
to  scheme
which
lured
men
away
from
the
factories
or
enabled
them
to
make
unlimited
demands
for
higher
wages
as
the
price
of
remaining
southern
planters
likewise
had
feared
free
homesteads
for
the
very
good
reason
that
they
only
promised
to
add
to
the
overbalancing
power
of
the
north
in
spite
of
the
opposition
supporters
of  liberal
land
policy
made
steady
gains
free
soil
democrats
jacksonian
farmers
and
mechanics
labor
reformers
and
political
leaders
like
stephen  douglas
of
illinois
and
andrew
johnson
of
tennessee
kept
up
the
agitation
in
season
and
out
more
than
once
were
they
able
to
force  homestead
bill
through
the
house
of
representatives
only
to
have
it
blocked
in
the
senate
where
southern
interests
were
intrenched
then
after
the
senate
was
won
over  democratic
president
james
buchanan
vetoed
the
bill
still
the
issue
lived
the
republicans
strong
among
the
farmers
of
the
northwest
favored
it
from
the
beginning
and
pressed
it
upon
the
attention
of
the
country
finally
the
manufacturers
yielded
they
received
their
compensation
in
the
contract
labor
law
in
congress
provided
for
the
free
distribution
of
land
in
acre
lots
among
men
and
women
of
strong
arms
and
willing
hearts
ready
to
build
their
serried
lines
of
homesteads
to
the
rockies
and
beyond
internal
improvements
if
farmers
and
manufacturers
were
early
divided
on
the
matter
of
free
homesteads
the
same
could
hardly
be
said
of
internal
improvements
the
western
tiller
of
the
soil
was
as
eager
for
some
easy
way
of
sending
his
produce
to
market
as
the
manufacturer
was
for
the
same
means
to
transport
his
goods
to
the
consumer
on
the
farm
while
the
confederate
leaders
were
writing
into
their
constitution  clause
forbidding
all
appropriations
for
internal
improvements
the
republican
leaders
at
washington
were
planning
such
expenditures
from
the
treasury
in
the
form
of
public
land
grants
to
railways
as
would
have
dazed
the
authors
of
the
national
road
bill
half  century
earlier
sound
finance
national
banking
from
hamilton  day
to
lincoln  business
men
in
the
east
had
contended
for  sound
system
of
national
currency
the
experience
of
the
states
with
paper
money
painfully
impressive
in
the
years
before
the
framing
of
the
constitution
had
been
convincing
to
those
who
understood
the
economy
of
business
the
constitution
as
we
have
seen
bore
the
signs
of
this
experience
states
were
forbidden
to
emit
bills
of
credit
paper
money
in
short
this
provision
stood
clear
in
the
document
but
judicial
ingenuity
had
circumvented
it
in
the
age
of
jacksonian
democracy
the
states
had
enacted
and
the
supreme
court
after
the
death
of
john
marshall
had
sustained
laws
chartering
banking
companies
and
authorizing
them
to
issue
paper
money
so
the
country
was
beset
by
the
old
curse
the
banks
of
western
and
southern
states
issuing
reams
of
paper
notes
to
help
borrowers
pay
their
debts
in
dealing
with
war
finances
the
republicans
attacked
this
ancient
evil
by
act
of
congress
in
they
authorized  series
of
national
banks
founded
on
the
credit
of
government
bonds
and
empowered
to
issue
notes
the
next
year
they
stopped
all
bank
paper
sent
forth
under
the
authority
of
the
states
by
means
of  prohibitive
tax
in
this
way
by
two
measures
congress
restored
federal
control
over
the
monetary
system
although
it
did
not
reestablish
the
united
states
bank
so
hated
by
jacksonian
democracy
destruction
of
states
rights
by
fourteenth
amendment
these
acts
and
others
not
cited
here
were
measures
of
centralization
and
consolidation
at
the
expense
of
the
powers
and
dignity
of
the
states
they
were
all
of
high
import
but
the
crowning
act
of
nationalism
was
the
fourteenth
amendment
which
among
other
things
forbade
states
to
deprive
any
person
of
life
liberty
or
property
without
due
process
of
law
the
immediate
occasion
though
not
the
actual
cause
of
this
provision
was
the
need
for
protecting
the
rights
of
freedmen
against
hostile
legislatures
in
the
south
the
result
of
the
amendment
as
was
prophesied
in
protests
loud
and
long
from
every
quarter
of
the
democratic
party
was
the
subjection
of
every
act
of
state
municipal
and
county
authorities
to
possible
annulment
by
the
supreme
court
at
washington
the
expected
happened
few
negroes
ever
brought
cases
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
the
attention
of
the
courts
but
thousands
of
state
laws
municipal
ordinances
and
acts
of
local
authorities
were
set
aside
as
null
and
void
under
it
laws
of
states
regulating
railway
rates
fixing
hours
of
labor
in
bakeshops
and
taxing
corporations
were
in
due
time
to
be
annulled
as
conflicting
with
an
amendment
erroneously
supposed
to
be
designed
solely
for
the
protection
of
negroes
as
centralized
power
over
tariffs
railways
public
lands
and
other
national
concerns
went
to
congress
so
centralized
power
over
the
acts
of
state
and
local
authorities
involving
an
infringement
of
personal
and
property
rights
was
conferred
on
the
federal
judiciary
the
apex
of
which
was
the
supreme
court
at
washington
thus
the
old
federation
of
independent
states
all
equal
in
rights
and
dignity
each
wearing
the
jewel
of
sovereignty
so
celebrated
in
southern
oratory
had
gone
the
way
of
all
flesh
under
the
withering
blasts
of
civil
war
reconstruction
in
the
south
theories
about
the
position
of
the
seceded
states
on
the
morning
of
april
when
general
lee
surrendered
his
army
to
general
grant
eleven
states
stood
in  peculiar
relation
to
the
union
now
declared
perpetual
lawyers
and
political
philosophers
were
much
perturbed
and
had
been
for
some
time
as
to
what
should
be
done
with
the
members
of
the
former
confederacy
radical
republicans
held
that
they
were
conquered
provinces
at
the
mercy
of
congress
to
be
governed
under
such
laws
as
it
saw
fit
to
enact
and
until
in
its
wisdom
it
decided
to
readmit
any
or
all
of
them
to
the
union
men
of
more
conservative
views
held
that
as
the
war
had
been
waged
by
the
north
on
the
theory
that
no
state
could
secede
from
the
union
the
confederate
states
had
merely
attempted
to
withdraw
and
had
failed
the
corollary
of
this
latter
line
of
argument
was
simple
the
southern
states
are
still
in
the
union
and
it
is
the
duty
of
the
president
as
commander
in
chief
to
remove
the
federal
troops
as
soon
as
order
is
restored
and
the
state
governments
ready
to
function
once
more
as
usual
lincoln  proposal
some
such
simple
and
conservative
form
of
reconstruction
had
been
suggested
by
lincoln
in  proclamation
of
december
he
proposed
pardon
and  restoration
of
property
except
in
slaves
to
nearly
all
who
had
directly
or
by
implication
participated
in
the
existing
rebellion
on
condition
that
they
take
an
oath
of
loyalty
to
the
union
he
then
announced
that
when
in
any
of
the
states
named  body
of
voters
qualified
under
the
law
as
it
stood
before
secession
and
equal
in
number
to
one
tenth
the
votes
cast
in
took
the
oath
of
allegiance
they
should
be
permitted
to
reestablish  state
government
such  government
he
added
should
be
recognized
as  lawful
authority
and
entitled
to
protection
under
the
federal
constitution
with
reference
to
the
status
of
the
former
slaves
lincoln
made
it
clear
that
while
their
freedom
must
be
recognized
he
would
not
object
to
any
legislation
which
may
yet
be
consistent
as  temporary
arrangement
with
their
present
condition
as  laboring
landless
and
homeless
class
andrew
johnson  plan
his
impeachment
lincoln  successor
andrew
johnson
the
vice
president
soon
after
taking
office
proposed
to
pursue  somewhat
similar
course
in  number
of
states
he
appointed
military
governors
instructing
them
at
the
earliest
possible
moment
to
assemble
conventions
chosen
by
that
portion
of
the
people
of
the
said
states
who
are
loyal
to
the
united
states
and
proceed
to
the
organization
of
regular
civil
government
johnson  southern
man
and  democrat
was
immediately
charged
by
the
republicans
with
being
too
ready
to
restore
the
southern
states
as
the
months
went
by
the
opposition
to
his
measures
and
policies
in
congress
grew
in
size
and
bitterness
the
contest
resulted
in
the
impeachment
of
johnson
by
the
house
of
representatives
in
march
and
his
acquittal
by
the
senate
merely
because
his
opponents
lacked
one
vote
of
the
two
thirds
required
for
conviction
congress
enacts
reconstruction
laws
in
fact
congress
was
in  strategic
position
it
was
the
law
making
body
and
it
could
moreover
determine
the
conditions
under
which
senators
and
representatives
from
the
south
were
to
be
readmitted
it
therefore
proceeded
to
pass  series
of
reconstruction
acts
carrying
all
of
them
over
johnson  veto
these
measures
the
first
of
which
became  law
on

betrayed
an
animus
not
found
anywhere
in
lincoln  plans
or
johnson  proclamations
they
laid
off
the
ten
states
the
whole
confederacy
with
the
exception
of
tennessee
still
outside
the
pale
into
five
military
districts
each
commanded
by  military
officer
appointed
by
the
president
they
ordered
the
commanding
general
to
prepare  register
of
voters
for
the
election
of
delegates
to
conventions
chosen
for
the
purpose
of
drafting
new
constitutions
such
voters
however
were
not
to
be
as
lincoln
had
suggested
loyal
persons
duly
qualified
under
the
law
existing
before
secession
but
the
male
citizens
of
said
state
twenty
one
years
old
and
upward
of
whatever
race
color
or
previous
condition
except
such
as
may
be
disfranchised
for
participation
in
the
rebellion
or
for
felony
at
common
law
this
was
the
death
knell
to
the
idea
that
the
leaders
of
the
confederacy
and
their
white
supporters
might
be
permitted
to
share
in
the
establishment
of
the
new
order
power
was
thus
arbitrarily
thrust
into
the
hands
of
the
newly
emancipated
male
negroes
and
the
handful
of
whites
who
could
show  record
of
loyalty
that
was
not
all
each
state
was
under
the
reconstruction
acts
compelled
to
ratify
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
the
federal
constitution
as  price
of
restoration
to
the
union
the
composition
of
the
conventions
thus
authorized
may
be
imagined
bondmen
without
the
asking
and
without
preparation
found
themselves
the
governing
power
an
army
of
adventurers
from
the
north
carpet
baggers
as
they
were
called
poured
in
upon
the
scene
to
aid
in
reconstruction
undoubtedly
many
men
of
honor
and
fine
intentions
gave
unstinted
service
but
the
results
of
their
deliberations
only
aggravated
the
open
wound
left
by
the
war
any
number
of
political
doctors
offered
their
prescriptions
but
no
effective
remedy
could
be
found
under
measures
admittedly
open
to
grave
objections
the
southern
states
were
one
after
another
restored
to
the
union
by
the
grace
of
congress
the
last
one
in
even
this
grudging
concession
of
the
formalities
of
statehood
did
not
mean  full
restoration
of
honors
and
privileges
the
last
soldier
was
not
withdrawn
from
the
last
southern
capital
until
and
federal
control
over
elections
long
remained
as  sign
of
congressional
supremacy
the
status
of
the
freedmen
even
more
intricate
than
the
issues
involved
in
restoring
the
seceded
states
to
the
union
was
the
question
of
what
to
do
with
the
newly
emancipated
slaves
that
problem
often
put
to
abolitionists
before
the
war
had
become
at
last  real
concern
the
thirteenth
amendment
abolishing
slavery
had
not
touched
it
at
all
it
declared
bondmen
free
but
did
nothing
to
provide
them
with
work
or
homes
and
did
not
mention
the
subject
of
political
rights
all
these
matters
were
left
to
the
states
and
the
legislatures
of
some
of
them
by
their
famous
black
codes
restored  form
of
servitude
under
the
guise
of
vagrancy
and
apprentice
laws
such
methods
were
in
fact
partly
responsible
for
the
reaction
that
led
congress
to
abandon
lincoln  policies
and
undertake
its
own
program
of
reconstruction
still
no
extensive
effort
was
made
to
solve
by
law
the
economic
problems
of
the
bondmen
radical
abolitionists
had
advocated
that
the
slaves
when
emancipated
should
be
given
outright
the
fields
of
their
former
masters
but
congress
steadily
rejected
the
very
idea
of
confiscation
the
necessity
of
immediate
assistance
it
recognized
by
creating
in
the
freedmen  bureau
to
take
care
of
refugees
it
authorized
the
issue
of
food
and
clothing
to
the
destitute
and
the
renting
of
abandoned
and
certain
other
lands
under
federal
control
to
former
slaves
at
reasonable
rates
but
the
larger
problem
of
the
relation
of
the
freedmen
to
the
land
it
left
to
the
slow
working
of
time
against
sharp
protests
from
conservative
men
particularly
among
the
democrats
congress
did
insist
however
on
conferring
upon
the
freedmen
certain
rights
by
national
law
these
rights
fell
into
broad
divisions
civil
and
political
by
an
act
passed
in
congress
gave
to
former
slaves
the
rights
of
white
citizens
in
the
matter
of
making
contracts
giving
testimony
in
courts
and
purchasing
selling
and
leasing
property
as
it
was
doubtful
whether
congress
had
the
power
to
enact
this
law
there
was
passed
and
submitted
to
the
states
the
fourteenth
amendment
which
gave
citizenship
to
the
freedmen
assured
them
of
the
privileges
and
immunities
of
citizens
of
the
united
states
and
declared
that
no
state
should
deprive
any
person
of
his
life
liberty
or
property
without
due
process
of
law
not
yet
satisfied
congress
attempted
to
give
social
equality
to
negroes
by
the
second
civil
rights
bill
of
which
promised
to
them
among
other
things
the
full
and
equal
enjoyment
of
inns
theaters
public
conveyances
and
places
of
amusement  law
later
declared
unconstitutional
by
the
supreme
court
the
matter
of
political
rights
was
even
more
hotly
contested
but
the
radical
republicans
like
charles
sumner
asserted
that
civil
rights
were
not
secure
unless
supported
by
the
suffrage
in
this
same
fourteenth
amendment
they
attempted
to
guarantee
the
ballot
to
all
negro
men
leaving
the
women
to
take
care
of
themselves
the
amendment
declared
in
effect
that
when
any
state
deprived
adult
male
citizens
of
the
right
to
vote
its
representation
in
congress
should
be
reduced
in
the
proportion
such
persons
bore
to
the
voting
population
this
provision
having
failed
to
accomplish
its
purpose
the
fifteenth
amendment
was
passed
and
ratified
expressly
declaring
that
no
citizen
should
be
deprived
of
the
right
to
vote
on
account
of
race
color
or
previous
condition
of
servitude
to
make
assurance
doubly
secure
congress
enacted
in
and
three
drastic
laws
sometimes
known
as
force
bills
providing
for
the
use
of
federal
authorities
civil
and
military
in
supervising
elections
in
all
parts
of
the

so
the
federal
government
having
destroyed
chattel
slavery
sought
by
legal
decree
to
sweep
away
all
its
signs
and
badges

social
and
political
never

in

of

conflict
just
as
the
united
states
under
the
impetus
of
western
enterprise
rounded
out
the
continental
domain
its
very
existence
as  nation
was
challenged
by  fratricidal
conflict
between
two
sections
this
storm
had
been
long
gathering
upon
the
horizon
from
the
very
beginning
in
colonial
times
there
had
been  marked
difference
between
the
south
and
the
north
the
former
by
climate
and
soil
was
dedicated
to  planting
system
the
cultivation
of
tobacco
rice
cotton
and
sugar
cane
and
in
the
course
of
time
slave
labor
became
the
foundation
of
the
system
the
north
on
the
other
hand
supplemented
agriculture
by
commerce

and
manufacturing
slavery
though
lawful
did
not
flourish
there
an
abundant
supply
of
free
labor
kept
the
northern
wheels
turning
this
difference
between
the
two
sections
early
noted
by
close
observers
was
increased
with
the
advent
of
the
steam
engine
and
the
factory
system
between
and
an
industrial
revolution
took
place
in
the
north
its
signs
were
gigantic
factories
huge
aggregations
of
industrial
workers
immense
cities  flourishing
commerce
and
prosperous
banks
finding
an
unfavorable
reception
in

western

in
time
the
industrial
north
and

evolved
different
ideas
of
political
policy
the
former
looked
with
favor
on
protective
tariffs
ship
subsidies  sound
national
banking
system
and
internal
improvements
the
farmers
of
the
west
demanded
that
the
public
domain
be
divided
up
into
free
homesteads
for
farmers
the
south
steadily
swung
around
to
the
opposite
view
its
spokesmen
came
to
regard
most
of
these
policies
as
injurious
to
the
planting
interests
the
economic
questions
were
all
involved
in  moral
issue
the
northern
states
in
which
slavery
was
of
slight
consequence
had
early
abolished
the
institution
in
the
course
of  few
years
there
appeared
uncompromising
advocates
of
universal
emancipation
far
and
wide
the
agitation
spread
the
south
was
thoroughly
frightened
it
demanded
protection
against
the
agitators
the
enforcement
of
its
rights
in
the
case
of
runaway
slaves
and
equal
privileges
for
slavery
in

with
the

years
the
conflict
between
the
two
sections
increased
in
bitterness
it
flamed
up
in

was
allayed
by
the
missouri
compromise
it
took
on
the
form

the
political
and

evolution
of
the
south
the
outcome
of
the
civil
war
in
the
south
was
nothing
short
of  revolution
the
ruling
class
the
law
and
the
government
of
the
old
order
had
been
subverted
to
political
chaos
was
added
the
havoc
wrought
in
agriculture
business
and
transportation
by
military
operations
and
as
if
to
fill
the
cup
to
the
brim
the
task
of
reconstruction
was
committed
to
political
leaders
from
another
section
of
the
country
strangers
to
the
life
and
traditions
of
the
south
the
south
at
the
close
of
the
war  ruling
class
disfranchised
as
the
sovereignty
of
the
planters
had
been
the
striking
feature
of
the
old
regime
so
their
ruin
was
the
outstanding
fact
of
the
new
the
situation
was
extraordinary
the
american
revolution
was
carried
out
by
people
experienced
in
the
arts
of
self
government
and
at
its
close
they
were
free
to
follow
the
general
course
to
which
they
had
long
been
accustomed
the
french
revolution
witnessed
the
overthrow
of
the
clergy
and
the
nobility
but
middle
classes
who
took
their
places
had
been
steadily
rising
in
intelligence
and
wealth
the
southern
revolution
was
unlike
either
of
these
cataclysms
it
was
not
brought
about
by  social
upheaval
but
by
an
external
crisis
it
did
not
enfranchise  class
that
sought
and
understood
power
but
bondmen
who
had
played
no
part
in
the
struggle
moreover
it
struck
down  class
equipped
to
rule
the
leading
planters
were
almost
to  man
excluded
from
state
and
federal
offices
and
the
fourteenth
amendment
was  bar
to
their
return
all
civil
and
military
places
under
the
authority
of
the
united
states
and
of
the
states
were
closed
to
every
man
who
had
taken
an
oath
to
support
the
constitution
as  member
of
congress
as  state
legislator
or
as  state
or
federal
officer
and
afterward
engaged
in
insurrection
or
rebellion
or
given
aid
and
comfort
to
the
enemies
of
the
united
states
this
sweeping
provision
supplemented
by
the
reconstruction
acts
laid
under
the
ban
most
of
the
talent
energy
and
spirit
of
the
south
the
condition
of
the

the

branches
of

governments
thus
passed
into
the
control
of
former

led
principally
by

adventurers
or
southern
novices
known
as
scalawags
the
result
was  carnival

rose

the

to
the

utterly
collapsed
and
was
as
worthless
as

the
restoration
of
white
supremacy
intimidation
in
both
politics
and
economics
the
process
of
reconstruction
in
the
south
was
slow
and
arduous
the
first
battle
in
the
political
contest
for
white
supremacy
was
won
outside
the
halls
of
legislatures
and
the
courts
of
law
it
was
waged
in
the
main
by
secret
organizations
among
which
the
ku
klux
klan
and
the
white
camelia
were
the
most
prominent
the
first
of
these
societies
appeared
in
tennessee
in
and
held
its
first
national
convention
the
following
year
it
was
in
origin  social
club
according
to
its
announcement
its
objects
were
to
protect
the
weak
the
innocent
and
the
defenceless
from
the
indignities
wrongs
and
outrages
of
the
lawless
the
violent
and
the
brutal
and
to
succor
the
suffering
especially
the
widows
and
orphans
of
the
confederate
soldiers
the
whole
south
was
called
the
empire
and
was
ruled
by  grand
wizard
each
state
was  realm
and
each
county  province
in
the
secret
orders
there
were
enrolled
over
half  million
men
the
methods
of
the
ku
klux
and
the
white
camelia
were
similar
solemn
parades
of
masked
men
on
horses
decked
in
long
robes
were
held
sometimes
in
the
daytime
and
sometimes
at
the
dead
of
night
notices
were
sent
to
obnoxious
persons
warning
them
to
stop
certain
practices
if
warning
failed
something
more
convincing
was
tried
fright
was
the
emotion
most
commonly
stirred  horseman
at
the
witching
hour
of
midnight
would
ride
up
to
the
house
of
some
offender
lift
his
head
gear
take
off  skull
and
hand
it
to
the
trembling
victim
with
the
request
that
he
hold
it
for  few
minutes
frequently
violence
was
employed
either
officially
or
unofficially
by
members
of
the
klan
tar
and
feathers
were
freely
applied
the
whip
was
sometimes
laid
on
unmercifully
and
occasionally  brutal
murder
was
committed
often
the
members
were
fired
upon
from
bushes
or
behind
trees
and
swift
retaliation
followed
so
alarming
did
the
clashes
become
that
in
congress
forbade
interference
with
electors
or
going
in
disguise
for
the
purpose
of
obstructing
the
exercise
of
the
rights
enjoyed
under
federal
law
in
anticipation
of
such  step
on
the
part
of
the
federal
government
the
ku
klux
was
officially
dissolved
by
the
grand
wizard
in
nevertheless
the
local
societies
continued
their
organization
and
methods
the
spirit
survived
the
national
association
on
the
whole
says  southern
writer
it
is
not
easy
to
see
what
other
course
was
open
to
the
south
armed
resistance
was
out
of
the
question
and
yet
there
must
be
some
control
had
of
the
situation
if
force
was
denied
craft
was
inevitable
the
struggle
for
the
ballot
box
the
effects
of
intimidation
were
soon
seen
at
elections
the
freedman
into
whose
inexperienced
hand
the
ballot
had
been
thrust
was
ordinarily
loath
to
risk
his
head
by
the
exercise
of
his
new
rights
he
had
not
attained
them
by  long
and
laborious
contest
of
his
own
and
he
saw
no
urgent
reason
why
he
should
battle
for
the
privilege
of
using
them
the
mere
show
of
force
the
mere
existence
of  threat
deterred
thousands
of
ex
slaves
from
appearing
at
the
polls
thus
the
whites
steadily
recovered
their
dominance
nothing
could
prevent
it
congress
enacted
force
bills
establishing
federal
supervision
of
elections
and
the
northern
politicians
protested
against
the
return
of
former
confederates
to
practical
if
not
official
power
but
all
such
opposition
was
like
resistance
to
the
course
of
nature
amnesty
for
southerners
the
recovery
of
white
supremacy
in
this
way
was
quickly
felt
in
national
councils
the
democratic
party
in
the
north
welcomed
it
as  sign
of
its
return
to
power
the
more
moderate
republicans
anxious
to
heal
the
breach
in
american
unity
sought
to
encourage
rather
than
to
repress
it
so
it
came
about
that
amnesty
for
confederates
was
widely
advocated
yet
it
must
be
said
that
the
struggle
for
the
removal
of
disabilities
was
stubborn
and
bitter
lincoln
with
characteristic
generosity
in
the
midst
of
the
war
had
issued  general
proclamation
of
amnesty
to
nearly
all
who
had
been
in
arms
against
the
union
on
condition
that
they
take
an
oath
of
loyalty
but
johnson
vindictive
toward
southern
leaders
and
determined
to
make
treason
infamous
had
extended
the
list
of
exceptions
congress
even
more
relentless
in
its
pursuit
of
confederates
pushed
through
the
fourteenth
amendment
which
worked
the
sweeping
disabilities
we
have
just
described
to
appeals
for
comprehensive
clemency
congress
was
at
first
adamant
in
vain
did
men
like
carl
schurz
exhort
their
colleagues
to
crown
their
victory
in
battle
with  noble
act
of
universal
pardon
and
oblivion
congress
would
not
yield
it
would
grant
amnesty
in
individual
cases
for
the
principle
of
proscription
it
stood
fast
when
finally
in
seven
years
after
the
surrender
at
appomattox
it
did
pass
the
general
amnesty
bill
it
insisted
on
certain
exceptions
confederates
who
had
been
members
of
congress
just
before
the
war
or
had
served
in
other
high
posts
civil
or
military
under
the
federal
government
were
still
excluded
from
important
offices
not
until
the
summer
of
when
the
war
with
spain
produced
once
more  union
of
hearts
did
congress
relent
and
abolish
the
last
of
the
disabilities
imposed
on
the
confederates
the
force
bills
attacked
and
nullified
the
granting
of
amnesty
encouraged
the
democrats
to
redouble
their
efforts
all
along
the
line
in
they
captured
the
house
of
representatives
and
declared
war
on
the
force
bills
as  republican
senate
blocked
immediate
repeal
they
resorted
to
an
ingenious
parliamentary
trick
to
the
appropriation
bill
for
the
support
of
the
army
they
attached  rider
or
condition
to
the
effect
that
no
troops
should
be
used
to
sustain
the
republican
government
in
louisiana
the
senate
rejected
the
proposal  deadlock
ensued
and
congress
adjourned
without
making
provision
for
the
army
satisfied
with
the
technical
victory
the
democrats
let
the
army
bill
pass
the
next
session
but
kept
up
their
fight
on
the
force
laws
until
they
wrung
from
president
hayes  measure
forbidding
the
use
of
united
states
troops
in
supervising
elections
the
following
year
they
again
had
recourse
to  rider
on
the
army
bill
and
carried
it
through
putting
an
end
to
the
use
of
money
for
military
control
of
elections
the
reconstruction
program
was
clearly
going
to
pieces
and
the
supreme
court
helped
along
the
process
of
dissolution
by
declaring
parts
of
the
laws
invalid
in
the
democrats
even
won  majority
in
the
senate
and
returned
to
power  large
number
of
men
once
prominent
in
the
confederate
cause
the
passions
of
the
war
by
this
time
were
evidently
cooling  new
generation
of
men
was
coming
on
the
scene
the
supremacy
of
the
whites
in
the
south
if
not
yet
complete
was
at
least
assured
federal
marshals
their
deputies
and
supervisors
of
elections
still
possessed
authority
over
the
polls
but
their
strength
had
been
shorn
by
the
withdrawal
of
united
states
troops
the
war
on
the
remaining
remnants
of
the
force
bills
lapsed
into
desultory
skirmishing
when
in
the
last
fragment
was
swept
away
the
country
took
little
note
of
the
fact
the
only
task
that
lay
before
the
southern
leaders
was
to
write
in
the
constitutions
of
their
respective
states
the
provisions
of
law
which
would
clinch
the
gains
so
far
secured
and
establish
white
supremacy
beyond
the
reach
of
outside
intervention
white
supremacy
sealed
by
new
state
constitutions
the
impetus
to
this
final
step
was
given
by
the
rise
of
the
populist
movement
in
the
south
which
sharply
divided
the
whites
and
in
many
communities
threw
the
balance
of
power
into
the
hands
of
the
few
colored
voters
who
survived
the
process
of
intimidation
southern
leaders
now
devised
new
constitutions
so
constructed
as
to
deprive
negroes
of
the
ballot
by
law
mississippi
took
the
lead
in
south
carolina
followed
five
years
later
louisiana
in
north
carolina
in
alabama
and
maryland
in
and
virginia
in
the
authors
of
these
measures
made
no
attempt
to
conceal
their
purposes
the
intelligent
white
men
of
the
south
said
governor
tillman
intend
to
govern
here
the
fifteenth
amendment
to
the
federal
constitution
however
forbade
them
to
deprive
any
citizen
of
the
right
to
vote
on
account
of
race
color
or
previous
condition
of
servitude
this
made
necessary
the
devices
of
indirection
they
were
few
simple
and
effective
the
first
and
most
easily
administered
was
the
ingenious
provision
requiring
each
prospective
voter
to
read  section
of
the
state
constitution
or
understand
and
explain
it
when
read
to
him
by
the
election
officers
as
an
alternative
the
payment
of
taxes
or
the
ownership
of  small
amount
of
property
was
accepted
as  qualification
for
voting
southern
leaders
unwilling
to
disfranchise
any
of
the
poor
white
men
who
had
stood
side
by
side
with
them
in
the
dark
days
of
reconstruction
also
resorted
to  famous
provision
known
as
the
grandfather
clause
this
plan
admitted
to
the
suffrage
any
man
who
did
not
have
either
property
or
educational
qualifications
provided
he
had
voted
on
or
before
or
was
the
son
or
grandson
of
any
such
person
the
devices
worked
effectively
of
the
negroes
in
mississippi
above
the
age
of
twenty
one
only
about
registered
under
the
constitution
of
louisiana
had
colored
voters
enrolled
in
under
the
constitution
drafted
two
years
later
the
registration
fell
to
an
analysis
of
the
figures
for
south
carolina
in
indicates
that
only
about
one
negro
out
of
every
hundred
adult
males
of
that
race
took
part
in
elections
thus
was
closed
this
chapter
of
reconstruction
the
supreme
court
refuses
to
intervene
numerous
efforts
were
made
to
prevail
upon
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
to
declare
such
laws
unconstitutional
but
the
court
usually
on
technical
grounds
avoided
coming
to  direct
decision
on
the
merits
of
the
matter
in
one
case
the
court
remarked
that
it
could
not
take
charge
of
and
operate
the
election
machinery
of
alabama
it
concluded
that
relief
from  great
political
wrong
if
done
as
alleged
by
the
people
of  state
and
by
the
state
itself
must
be
given
by
them
or
by
the
legislative
and
executive
departments
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
only
one
of
the
several
schemes
employed
namely
the
grandfather
clause
was
held
to
be  violation
of
the
federal
constitution
this
blow
effected
in
by
the
decision
in
the
oklahoma
and
maryland
cases
left
however
the
main
structure
of
disfranchisement
unimpaired
proposals
to
reduce
southern
representation
in
congress
these
provisions
excluding
thousands
of
male
citizens
from
the
ballot
did
not
in
express
terms
deprive
any
one
of
the
vote
on
account
of
race
or
color
they
did
not
therefore
run
counter
to
the
letter
of
the
fifteenth
amendment
but
they
did
unquestionably
make
the
states
which
adopted
them
liable
to
the
operations
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
the
latter
very
explicitly
provides
that
whenever
any
state
deprives
adult
male
citizens
of
the
right
to
vote
except
in
certain
minor
cases
the
representation
of
the
state
in
congress
shall
be
reduced
in
the
proportion
which
such
number
of
disfranchised
citizens
bears
to
the
whole
number
of
male
citizens
over
twenty
one
years
of
age
mindful
of
this
provision
those
who
protested
against
disfranchisement
in
the
south
turned
to
the
republican
party
for
relief
asking
for
action
by
the
political
branches
of
the
federal
government
as
the
supreme
court
had
suggested
the
republicans
responded
in
their
platform
of
by
condemning
all
devices
designed
to
deprive
any
one
of
the
ballot
for
reasons
of
color
alone
they
demanded
the
enforcement
in
letter
and
spirit
of
the
fourteenth
as
well
as
all
other
amendments
though
victorious
in
the
election
the
republicans
refrained
from
reopening
the
ancient
contest
they
made
no
attempt
to
reduce
southern
representation
in
the
house
southern
leaders
while
protesting
against
the
declarations
of
their
opponents
were
able
to
view
them
as
idle
threats
in
no
way
endangering
the
security
of
the
measures
by
which
political
reconstruction
had
been
undone
the
solid
south
out
of
the
thirty
year
conflict
against
carpet
bag
rule
there
emerged
what
was
long
known
as
the
solid
south  south
that
except
occasionally
in
the
border
states
never
gave
an
electoral
vote
to  republican
candidate
for
president
before
the
civil
war
the
southern
people
had
been
divided
on
political
questions
take
for
example
the
election
of
in
all
the
fifteen
slave
states
the
variety
of
opinion
was
marked
in
nine
of
them
delaware
virginia
tennessee
missouri
maryland
louisiana
kentucky
georgia
and
arkansas
the
combined
vote
against
the
representative
of
the
extreme
southern
point
of
view
breckinridge
constituted  safe
majority
in
each
of
the
six
states
which
were
carried
by
breckinridge
there
was  large
and
powerful
minority
in
north
carolina
breckinridge  majority
over
bell
and
douglas
was
only
votes
equally
astounding
to
those
who
imagine
the
south
united
in
defense
of
extreme
views
in
was
the
vote
for
bell
the
unionist
candidate
who
stood
firmly
for
the
constitution
and
silence
on
slavery
in
every
southern
state
bell  vote
was
large
in
virginia
kentucky
missouri
and
tennessee
it
was
greater
than
that
received
by
breckinridge
in
georgia
it
was
against
in
louisiana
against
in
mississippi
against
the
effect
of
the
civil
war
upon
these
divisions
was
immediate
and
decisive
save
in
the
border
states
where
thousands
of
men
continued
to
adhere
to
the
cause
of
union
in
the
confederacy
itself
nearly
all
dissent
was
silenced
by
war
men
who
had
been
bitter
opponents
joined
hands
in
defense
of
their
homes
when
the
armed
conflict
was
over
they
remained
side
by
side
working
against
republican
misrule
and
negro
domination
by
after
northern
supremacy
was
definitely
broken
they
boasted
that
there
were
at
least
twelve
southern
states
in
which
no
republican
candidate
for
president
could
win  single
electoral
vote
dissent
in
the
solid
south
though
every
one
grew
accustomed
to
speak
of
the
south
as
solid
it
did
not
escape
close
observers
that
in  number
of
southern
states
there
appeared
from
time
to
time  fairly
large
body
of
dissenters
in
the
populists
made
heavy
inroads

the
economic
advance
of
the
south
the
break
up
of
the
great
estates
in
the
dissolution
of
chattel
slavery
it
was
inevitable
that
the
great
estate
should
give
way
before
the
small
farm
the
plantation
was
in
fact
founded
on
slavery
it
was
continued
and
expanded
by
slavery
before
the
war
the
prosperous
planter
either
by
inclination
or
necessity
invested
his
surplus
in
more
land
to
add
to
his
original
domain
as
his
slaves
increased
in
number
he
was
forced
to
increase
his
acreage
or
sell
them
and
he
usually
preferred
the
former
especially
in
the
far
south
still
another
element
favored
the
large
estate
slave
labor
quickly
exhausted
the
soil
and
of
its
own
force
compelled
the
cutting
of
the
forests
and
the
extension
of
the
area
under
cultivation
finally
the
planter
took  natural
pride
in
his
great
estate
it
was  sign
of
his
prowess
and
his
social
prestige
in
the
foundations
of
the
planting
system
were
gone
it
was
difficult
to
get
efficient
labor
to
till
the
vast
plantations
the
planters
themselves
were
burdened
with
debts
and
handicapped
by
lack
of
capital
negroes
commonly
preferred
tilling
plots
of
their
own
rented
or
bought
under
mortgage
to
the
more
irksome
wage
labor
under
white
supervision
the
land
hunger
of
the
white
farmer
once
checked
by
the
planting
system
reasserted
itself
before
these
forces
the
plantation
broke
up
the
small
farm
became
the
unit
of
cultivation
in
the
south
as
in
the
north
between
and
the
number
of

doubled
in
every
state
south
of
the
line
of
the
potomac
and
ohio
rivers
except
in
arkansas
and
louisiana
from
year
to
year
the
process
of
breaking
up
continued
with
all
that
it
implied
in
the
creation
of
land
owning
farmers
the
diversification
of
crops
no
less
significant
was
the
concurrent
diversification
of
crops
under
slavery
tobacco
rice
and
sugar
were
staples
and
cotton
was
king
these
were
standard
crops
the
methods
of
cultivation
were
simple
and
easily
learned
they
tested
neither
the
skill
nor
the
ingenuity
of
the
slaves
as
the
returns
were
quick
they
did
not
call
for
long
time
investments
of
capital
after
slavery
was
abolished
they
still
remained
the
staples
but
far
sighted
agriculturists
saw
the
dangers
of
depending
upon  few
crops
the
mild
climate
all
the
way
around
the
coast
from
virginia
to
texas
and
the
character
of
the
alluvial
soil
invited
the
exercise
of
more
imagination

the
development
of

was
in
every
respect
remarkable
particularly
in
louisiana
arkansas
and
mississippi
at
the
end
of
the
first

of
the
twentieth
century
primacy
in
lumber
had
passed
from
the
great

region
to
the
south

states
produced
nearly
four
times
as
much
lumber
as
the
lake
states
and
twice
as
much
as
the
vast
forests
of

and

the
development
of
the
cotton
industry
in
the
meantime
was
similarly
astounding
in
cotton
spinning
was  negligible
matter
in
the
southern
states
in
they
had
one
fourth
of
the
mills
of
the
country
at
the
end
of
the
century
they
had
one
half
the
mills
the
two

taking
the
lead
by
consuming
more
than
one
third
of
their
entire

crop

both

at

they
enjoyed

at
the
opening
of

were
outstripping
the

in
the
proportion

put

moreover
the
cotton

finding  market
at

began
to
look
forward
to  day

they
would
be
somewhat
emancipated

years
over
thirty
thousand

added

being
in

about
there
opened  period
of
consolidation
in
which
scores
of
short
lines
were
united
mainly
under
the
leadership
of
northern
capitalists
and
new
through
service
opened
to
the
north
and
west
thus
southern
industries
were
given
easy
outlets
to
the
markets
of
the
nation
and
brought
within
the
main
currents
of
national
business
enterprise
the
social
effects
of
the
economic
changes
as
long
as
the
slave
system
lasted
and
planting
was
the
major
interest
the
south
was
bound
to
be
sectional
in
character
with
slavery
gone
crops
diversified
natural
resources
developed
and
industries
promoted
the
social
order
of
the
ante
bellum
days
inevitably
dissolved
the
south
became
more
and
more
assimilated
to
the
system
of
the
north
in
this
process
several
lines
of
development
are
evident
in
the
first
place
we
see
the
steady
rise
of
the
small
farmer
even
in
the
old
days
there
had
been  large
class
of
white
yeomen
who
owned
no
slaves
and
tilled
the
soil
with
their
own
hands
but
they
labored
under
severe
handicaps
they
found
the
fertile
lands
of
the
coast
and
river
valleys
nearly
all
monopolized
by
planters
and
they
were
by
the
force
of
circumstances
driven
into
the
uplands
where
the
soil
was
thin
and
the
crops
were
light
still
they
increased
in
numbers
and
zealously
worked
their
freeholds
the
war
proved
to
be
their
opportunity
with
the
break
up
of
the
plantations
they
managed
to
buy
land
more
worthy
of
their
plows
by
intelligent
labor
and
intensive
cultivation
they
were
able
to
restore
much
of
the
worn
out
soil
to
its
original
fertility
in
the
meantime
they
rose
with
their
prosperity
in
the
social
and
political
scale
it
became
common
for
the
sons
of
white
farmers
to
enter
the
professions
while
their
daughters
went
away
to
college
and
prepared
for
teaching
thus  more
democratic
tone
was
given
to
the
white
society
of
the
south
moreover
the
migration
to
the
north
and
west
which
had
formerly
carried
thousands
of
energetic
sons
and
daughters
to
search
for
new
homesteads
was
materially
reduced
the
energy
of
the
agricultural
population
went
into
rehabilitation
the
increase
in
the
number
of
independent
farmers
was
accompanied
by
the
rise
of
small
towns
and
villages
which
gave
diversity
to
the
life
of
the
south
before
it
was
possible
to
travel
through
endless
stretches
of
cotton
and
tobacco
the
social
affairs
of
the
planter  family
centered
in
the
homestead
even
if
they
were
occasionally
interrupted
by
trips
to
distant
cities
or
abroad
carpentry
bricklaying
and
blacksmithing
were
usually
done
by
slaves
skilled
in
simple
handicrafts
supplies
were
bought
wholesale
in
this
way
there
was
little
place
in
plantation
economy
for
villages
and
towns
with
their
stores
and
mechanics
the
abolition
of
slavery
altered
this
small
farms
spread
out
where
plantations
had
once
stood
the
skilled
freedmen
turned
to
agriculture
rather
than
to
handicrafts
white
men
of  business
or
mechanical
bent
found
an
opportunity
to
serve
the
needs
of
their
communities
so
local
merchants
and
mechanics
became
an
important
element
in
the
social
system
in
the
county
seats
once
dominated
by
the
planters
business
and
professional
men
assumed
the
leadership
another
vital
outcome
of
this
revolution
was
the
transference
of  large
part
of
planting
enterprise
to
business
mr
bruce  southern
historian
of
fine
scholarship
has
summed
up
this
process
in  single
telling
paragraph
the
higher
planting
class
that
under
the
old
system
gave
so
much
distinction
to
rural
life
has
so
far
as
it
has
survived
at
all
been
concentrated
in
the
cities
the
families
that
in
the
time
of
slavery
would
have
been
found
only
in
the
country
are
now
found
with  few
exceptions
in
the
towns
the
transplantation
has
been
practically
universal
the
talent
the
energy
the
ambition
that
formerly
sought
expression
in
the
management
of
great
estates
and
the
control
of
hosts
of
slaves
now
seek  field
of
action
in
trade
in
manufacturing
enterprises
or
in
the
general
enterprises
of
development
this
was
for
the
ruling
class
of
the
south
the
natural
outcome
of
the
great
economic
revolution
that
followed
the
war
as
in
all
other
parts
of
the
world
the
mechanical
revolution
was
attended
by
the
growth
of  population
of
industrial
workers
dependent
not
upon
the
soil
but
upon
wages
for
their
livelihood
when
jefferson
davis
was
inaugurated
president
of
the
southern
confederacy
there
were
approximately
only
one
hundred
thousand
persons
employed
in
southern
manufactures
as
against
more
than  million
in
northern
mills
fifty
years
later
georgia
and
alabama
alone
had
more
than
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
wage
earners
necessarily
this
meant
also  material
increase
in
urban
population
although
the
wide
dispersion
of
cotton
spinning
among
small
centers
prevented
the
congestion
that
had
accompanied
the
rise
of
the
textile
industry
in
new
england
in
new
orleans
atlanta
memphis
nashville
and
houston
stood
in
the
same
relation
to
the
new
south
that
cincinnati
chicago
cleveland
and
detroit
had
stood
to
the
new
west
fifty
years
before
the
problems
of
labor
and
capital
and
municipal
administration
which
the
earlier
writers
boasted
would
never
perplex
the
planting
south
had
come
in

the
revolution
in
the
status
of
the
slaves
no
part
of
southern
society
was
so
profoundly
affected
by
the
civil
war
and
economic
reconstruction
as
the
former
slaves
on
the
day
of
emancipation
they
stood
free
but
empty
handed
the
owners
of
no
tools
or
property
the
masters
of
no
trade
and
wholly
inexperienced
in
the
arts
of
self
help
that
characterized
the
whites
in
general
they
had
never
been
accustomed
to
looking
out
for
themselves
the
plantation
bell
had
called
them
to
labor
and
released
them
doles
of
food
and
clothing
had
been
regularly
made
in
given
quantities
they
did
not
understand
wages
ownership
renting
contracts
mortgages
leases
bills
or
accounts
when
they
were
emancipated
four
courses
were
open
to
them
they
could
flee
from
the
plantation
to
the
nearest
town
or
city
or
to
the
distant
north
to
seek  livelihood
thousands
of
them
chose
this
way
overcrowding
cities
where
disease
mowed
them
down
they
could
remain
where
they
were
in
their
cabins
and
work
for
daily
wages
instead
of
food
clothing
and
shelter
this
second
course
the
major
portion
of
them
chose
but
as
few
masters
had
cash
to
dispense
the
new
relation
was
much
like
the
old
in
fact
it
was
still
one
of
barter
the
planter
offered
food
clothing
and
shelter
the
former
slaves
gave
their
labor
in
return
that
was
the
best
that
many
of
them
could
do  third
course
open
to
freedmen
was
that
of
renting
from
the
former
master
paying
him
usually
with  share
of
the
produce
of
the
land
this
way  large
number
of
them
chose
it
offered
them  chance
to
become
land
owners
in
time
and
it
afforded
an
easier
life
the
renter
being
to  certain
extent
at
least
master
of
his
own
hours
of
labor
the
final
and
most
difficult
path
was
that
to
ownership
of
land
many  master
helped
his
former
slaves
to
acquire
small
holdings
by
offering
easy
terms
the
more
enterprising
and
the
more
fortunate
who
started
life
as
renters
or
wage
earners
made
their
way
upward
to
ownership
in
so
many
cases
that
by
the
end
of
the
century
one
fourth
of
the
colored
laborers
on
the
land
owned
the
soil
they
tilled
in
the
meantime
the
south
though
relatively
poor
made
relatively
large
expenditures
for
the
education
of
the
colored
population
by
the
opening
of
the
twentieth
century
facilities
were
provided
for
more
than
one
half
of
the
colored
children
of
school
age
while
in
many
respects
this
progress
was
disappointing
its
significance
to
be
appreciated
must
be
derived
from  comparison
with
the
total
illiteracy
which
prevailed
under
slavery
in
spite
of
all
that
happened
however
the
status
of
the
negroes
in
the
south
continued
to
give  peculiar
character
to
that
section
of
the
country
they
were
almost
entirely
excluded
from
the
exercise
of
the
suffrage
especially
in
the
far
south
special
rooms
were
set
aside
for
them
at
the
railway
stations
and
special
cars
on
the
railway
lines
in
the
field
of
industry
calling
for
technical
skill
it
appears
from
the
census
figures
that
they
lost
ground
between
and  condition
which
their
friends
ascribed
to
discriminations
against
them
in
law
and
in
labor
organizations
and
their
critics
ascribed
to
their
lack
of
aptitude
whatever
may
be
the
truth
the
fact
remained
that
at
the
opening
of
the
twentieth
century
neither
the
hopes
of
the
emancipators
nor
the
fears
of
their
opponents
were
realized
the
marks
of
the
peculiar
institution
were
still
largely
impressed
upon
southern
society
the
situation
however
was
by
no
means
unchanging
on
the
contrary
there
was  decided
drift
in
affairs
for
one
thing
the
proportion
of
negroes
in
the

slowly
declined
by
they
were

in

in

virginia
west
virginia
and
north

the
proportion
of
the
white
population
was
steadily
growing
the
colored
migration
northward
increased
while
the
westward
movement
of
white
farmers
which
characterized
pioneer
days
declined
at
the
same
time  part
of
the
foreign
immigration
into
the
united
states
was
diverted
southward
as
the
years
passed
these
tendencies
gained
momentum
the
already
huge
colored
quarters
in
some
northern
cities
were
widely
expanded
as
whole
counties
in
the
south
were
stripped
of
their
colored
laborers
the
race
question
in
its
political

economic
aspects
became

more

chosen
to
characterize

must
be
business

and
applied
without
let
or

to
the

all
into

in
this

it
was
inevitable
that  few
great

like

should
rise
to  position
of

one

comparable
in

the

with

states
of

the
effect
of
its
rise
and
growth
cannot
be
summarily
estimated
but
some
special
facts
are
obvious
it
made
possible
gigantic
enterprises
once
entirely
beyond
the
reach
of
any
individual
no
matter
how
rich
it
eliminated
many
of
the
futile
and
costly
wastes
of
competition
in
connection
with
manufacture
advertising
and
selling
it
studied
the
cheapest
methods
of
production
and
shut
down
mills
that
were
poorly
equipped
or
disadvantageously
located
it
established
laboratories
for
research
in
industry
chemistry
and
mechanical
inventions
through
the
sale
of
stocks
and
bonds
it
enabled
tens
of
thousands
of
people
to
become
capitalists
if
only
in  small
way
the
corporation
made
it
possible
for
one
person
to
own
for
instance  share
in  million
dollar
business
concern  thing
entirely
impossible
under  regime
of
individual
owners
and
partnerships
there
was
of
course
another
side
to
the
picture
many
of
the
corporations
sought
to
become
monopolies
and
to
make
profits
not
by
economies
and
good
management
but
by
extortion
from
purchasers
sometimes
they
mercilessly
crushed
small
business
men
their
competitors
bribed
members
of
legislatures
to
secure
favorable
laws
and
contributed
to
the
campaign

of
both
leading
parties
wherever  trust
approached
the
position
of  monopoly
it
acquired  dominion
over
the
labor
market
which
enabled
it
to
break
even
the
strongest
trade
unions
in
short
the
power
of
the
trust
in
finance
in
manufacturing
in
politics
and
in
the
field
of
labor
control
can
hardly
be
measured
the
corporation
and
labor
in
the
development
of
the
corporation
there
was
to
be
observed  distinct
severing
of
the
old
ties
between
master
and
workmen
which
existed
in
the
days
of
small
industries
for
the
personal
bond
between
the
owner
and
the
employees
was
substituted  new
relation
in
most
parts
of
our
country
as
president
wilson
once
said
men
work
not
for
themselves
not
as
partners
in
the
old
way
in
which
they
used
to
work
but
generally
as
employees
in  higher
or
lower
grade
of
great
corporations
the
owner
disappeared
from
the
factory
and
in
his
place
came
the
manager
representing
the
usually
invisible
stockholders
and
dependent
for
his
success
upon
his
ability
to
make
profits
for
the
owners
hence
the
term
soulless
corporation
which
was
to
exert
such  deep
influence

thinking

the

the

so
dreaded
by
jefferson
had
arrived
people
were
piled
upon
one
another
in
great
cities
and
the
republic
of
small
farmers
had
passed
away
to
these
industrial
centers
flowed
annually
an
ever
increasing
tide
of
immigration
reaching
the
half
million
point
in
rising
to
three
quarters
of  million
three
years
later
and
passing
the
million
mark
in  single
year
at
the
opening
of
the
new
century
immigration
was
as
old
as
america
but
new
elements
now
entered
the
situation
in
the
first
place
there
were
radical
changes
in
the
nationality
of
the
newcomers
the
migration
from
northern
europe
england
ireland
germany
and
scandinavia
diminished
that
from
italy
russia
and
austria
hungary
increased
more
than
three
fourths
of
the
entire
number
coming
from
these
three
lands
between
the
years
and
these
later
immigrants
were
italians
poles
magyars
czechs
slovaks
russians
and
jews
who
came
from
countries
far
removed
from
the
language
and
the
traditions
of
england
whence
came
the
founders
of
america
in
the
second
place
the
reception
accorded
the
newcomers
differed
from
that
given
to
the
immigrants
in
the
early
days
by
all
the
free
land
was
gone
they
could
not
therefore
be
dispersed
widely
among
the
native
americans
to
assimilate
quickly
and
unconsciously
the
habits
and
ideas
of
american
life
on
the
contrary
they
were
diverted
mainly
to
the
industrial
centers
there
they
crowded
nay
overcrowded
into
colonies
of
their
own
where
they
preserved
their
languages
their
newspapers
and
their
old
world
customs
and
views
so
eager
were
american
business
men
to
get
an
enormous
labor
supply
that
they
asked
few
questions
about
the
effect
of
this
alien
invasion
upon
the
old
america
inherited
from
the
fathers
they
even
stimulated
the
invasion
artificially
by
importing
huge
armies
of
foreigners
under
contract
to
work
in
specified
mines
and
mills
there
seemed
to
be
no
limit
to
the
factories
forges
refineries
and
railways
that
could
be
built
to
the
multitudes
that
could
be
employed
in
conquering  continent
as
for
the
future
that
was
in
the
hands
of
providence
business
theories
of
politics
as
the
statesmen
of
hamilton  school
and
the
planters
of
calhoun  had
their
theories
of
government
and
politics
so
the
leaders
in
business
enterprise
had
theirs
it
was
simple
and
easily
stated
it
is
the
duty
of
the
government
they
urged
to
protect
american
industry
against
foreign
competition
by
means
of
high
tariffs
on
imported
goods
to
aid
railways
by
generous
grants
of
land
to
sell
mineral
and
timber
lands
at
low
prices
to
energetic
men
ready
to
develop
them
and
then
to
leave
the
rest
to
the
initiative
and
drive
of
individuals
and
companies
all
government
interference
with
the
management
prices
rates
charges
and
conduct
of
private
business
they
held
to
be
either
wholly
pernicious
or
intolerably
impertinent
judging
from
their
speeches
and
writings
they
conceived
the
nation
as  great
collection
of
individuals
companies
and
labor
unions
all
struggling
for
profits
or
high
wages
and
held
together
by  government
whose
principal
duty
was
to
keep
the
peace
among
them
and
protect
industry
against
the
foreign
manufacturer
such
was
the
political
theory
of
business
during
the
generation
that
followed
the
civil
war
the
supremacy
of
the
republican
party
business
men
and
republican
policies
most
of
the
leaders
in
industry
gravitated
to
the
republican
ranks
they
worked
in
the
north
and
the
republican
party
was
essentially
northern
it
was
moreover
at
least
so
far
as
the
majority
of
its
members
were
concerned
committed
to
protective
tariffs  sound
monetary
and
banking
system
the
promotion
of
railways
and
industry
by
land
grants
and
the
development
of
internal
improvements
it
was
furthermore
generous
in
its
immigration
policy
it
proclaimed
america
to
be
an
asylum
for
the
oppressed
of
all
countries
and
flung
wide
the
doors
for
immigrants
eager
to
fill
the
factories
man
the
mines
and
settle
upon
western
lands
in  word
the
republicans
stood
for
all
those
specific
measures
which
favored
the
enlargement
and
prosperity
of
business
at
the
same
time
they
resisted
government
interference
with
private
enterprise
they
did
not
regulate
railway
rates
prosecute
trusts
for
forming
combinations
or
prevent
railway
companies
from
giving
lower
rates
to
some
shippers
than
to
others
to
sum
it
up
the
political
theories
of
the
republican
party
for
three
decades
after
the
civil
war
were
the
theories
of
american
business
prosperous
and
profitable
industries
for
the
owners
and
the
full
dinner
pail
for
the
workmen
naturally  large
portion
of
those
who
flourished
under
its
policies
gave
their
support
to
it
voted
for
its
candidates
and
subscribed
to
its
campaign
funds
sources
of
republican
strength
in
the
north
the
republican
party
was
in
fact  political
organization
of
singular
power
it
originated
in  wave
of
moral
enthusiasm
having
attracted
to
itself
if
not
the
abolitionists
certainly
all
those
idealists
like
james
russell
lowell
and
george
william
curtis
who
had
opposed
slavery
when
opposition
was
neither
safe
nor
popular
to
moral
principles
it
added
practical
considerations
business
men
had
confidence
in
it
workingmen
who
longed
for
the
independence
of
the
farmer
owed
to
its
indulgent
land
policy
the
opportunity
of
securing
free
homesteads
in
the
west
the
immigrant
landing
penniless
on
these
shores
as  result
of
the
same
beneficent
system
often
found
himself
in  little
while
with
an
estate
as
large
as
many  baronial
domain
in
the
old
world
under  republican
administration
the
union
had
been
saved
to
it
the
veterans
of
the
war
could
turn
with
confidence
for
those
rewards
of
service
which
the
government
could
bestow
pensions
surpassing
in
liberality
anything
that
the
world
had
ever
seen
under  republican
administration
also
the
great
debt
had
been
created
in
the
defense
of
the
union
and
to
the
republican
party
every
investor
in
government
bonds
could
look
for
the
full
and
honorable
discharge
of
the
interest
and
principal
the
spoils
system
inaugurated
by
jacksonian
democracy
in
turn
placed
all
the
federal
offices
in
republican
hands
furnishing
an
army
of
party
workers
to
be
counted
on
for
loyal
service
in
every
campaign
of
all
these
things
republican
leaders
made
full
and
vigorous
use
sometimes
ascribing
to
the
party
in
accordance
with
ancient
political
usage
merits
and
achievements
not
wholly
its
own
particularly
was
this
true
in
the
case
of
saving
the
union
when
in
the
economy
of
providence
this
land
was
to
be
purged
of
human
slavery
the
republican
party
came
into
power
ran  declaration
in
one
platform
the
republican
party
suppressed  gigantic
rebellion
emancipated
four
million
slaves
decreed
the
equal
citizenship
of
all
and
established
universal
suffrage
ran
another
as
for
the
aid
rendered
by
the
millions
of
northern
democrats
who
stood
by
the
union
and
the
tens
of
thousands
of
them
who
actually
fought
in
the
union
army
the
republicans
in
their
zeal
were
inclined
to
be
oblivious
they
repeatedly
charged
the
democratic
party
with
being
the
same
in
character
and
spirit
as
when
it
sympathized
with
treason
republican
control
of
the
south
to
the
strength
enjoyed
in
the
north
the
republicans
for  long
time
added
the
advantages
that
came
from
control
over
the
former
confederate
states
where
the
newly
enfranchised
negroes
under
white
leadership
gave  grateful
support
to
the
party
responsible
for
their
freedom
in
this
branch
of
politics
motives
were
so
mixed
that
no
historian
can
hope
to
appraise
them
all
at
their
proper
values
on
the
one
side
of
the
ledger
must
be
set
the
vigorous
efforts
of
the
honest
and
sincere
friends
of
the
freedmen
to
win
for
them
complete
civil
and
political
equality
wiping
out
not
only
slavery
but
all
its
badges
of
misery
and
servitude
on
the
same
side
must
be
placed
the
labor
of
those
who
had
valiantly
fought
in
forum
and
field
to
save
the
union
and
who
regarded
continued
republican
supremacy
after
the
war
as
absolutely
necessary
to
prevent
the
former
leaders
in
secession
from
coming
back
to
power
at
the
same
time
there
were
undoubtedly
some
men
of
the
baser
sort
who
looked
on
politics
as  game
and
who
made
use
of
carpet
bagging
in
the
south
to
win
the
spoils
that
might
result
from
it
at
all
events
both
by
laws
and
presidential
acts
the
republicans
for
many
years
kept  keen
eye
upon
the
maintenance
of
their
dominion
in
the
south
their
declaration
that
neither
the
law
nor
its
administration
should
admit
any
discrimination
in
respect
of
citizens
by
reason
of
race
color
or
previous
condition
of
servitude
appealed
to
idealists
and
brought
results
in
elections
even
south
carolina
where
reposed
the
ashes
of
john  calhoun
went
republican
in
by  vote
of
three
to
one
republican
control
was
made
easy
by
the
force
bills
described
in  previous
chapter
measures
which
vested
the
supervision
of
elections
in
federal
officers
appointed
by
republican
presidents
these
drastic
measures
departing
from
american
tradition
the
republican
authors
urged
were
necessary
to
safeguard
the
purity
of
the
ballot
not
merely
in
the
south
where
the
timid
freedman
might
readily
be
frightened
from
using
it
but
also
in
the
north
particularly
in
new
york
city
where
it
was
claimed
that
fraud
was
regularly
practiced
by
democratic
leaders
the
democrats
on
their
side
indignantly
denied
the
charges
replying
that
the
force
bills
were
nothing
but
devices
created
by
the
republicans
for
the
purpose
of
securing
their
continued
rule
through
systematic
interference
with
elections
even
the
measures
of
reconstruction
were
deemed
by
democratic
leaders
as
thinly
veiled
schemes
to
establish
republican
power
throughout
the
country
nor
is
there
the
slightest
doubt
exclaimed
samuel  tilden
spokesman
of
the
democrats
in
new
york
and
candidate
for
president
in
that
the
paramount
object
and
motive
of
the
republican
party
is
by
these
means
to
secure
itself
against  reaction
of
opinion
adverse
to
it
in
our
great
populous
northern
commonwealths
when
the
republican
party
resolved
to
establish
negro
supremacy
in
the
ten
states
in
order
to
gain
to
itself
the
representation
of
those
states
in
congress
it
had
to
begin
by
governing
the
people
of
those
states
by
the
sword
the
next
was
the
creation
of
new
electoral
bodies
for
those
ten
states
in
which
by
exclusions
by
disfranchisements
and
proscriptions
by
control
over
registration
by
applying
test
oaths
by
intimidation
and
by
every
form
of
influence
three
million
negroes
are
made
to
predominate
over
four
and  half
million
whites
the
war
as  campaign
issue
even
the
repeal
of
force
bills
could
not
allay
the
sectional
feelings
engendered
by
the
war
the
republicans
could
not
forgive
the
men
who
had
so
recently
been
in
arms
against
the
union
and
insisted
on
calling
them
traitors
and
rebels
the
southerners
smarting
under
the
reconstruction
acts
could
regard
the
republicans
only
as
political
oppressors
the
passions
of
the
war
had
been
too
strong
the
distress
too
deep
to
be
soon
forgotten
the
generation
that
went
through
it
all
remembered
it
all
for
twenty
years
the
republicans
in
their
speeches
and
platforms
made  straight
appeal
to
the
patriotism
of
the
northern
voters
they
maintained
that
their
party
which
had
saved
the
union
and
emancipated
the
slaves
was
alone
worthy
of
protecting
the
union
and
uplifting
the
freedmen
though
the
democrats
especially
in
the
north
resented
this
policy
and
dubbed
it
with
the
expressive
but
inelegant
phrase
waving
the
bloody
shirt
the
republicans
refused
to
surrender  slogan
which
made
such  ready
popular
appeal
as
late
as  leader
expressed
the
hope
that
they
might
wring
one
more
president
from
the
bloody
shirt
they
refused
to
let
the
country
forget
that
the
democratic
candidate
grover
cleveland
had
escaped
military
service
by
hiring  substitute
and
they
made
political
capital
out
of
the
fact
that
he
had
insulted
the
veterans
of
the
grand
army
of
the
republic
by
going
fishing
on
decoration
day
three
republican
presidents
fortified
by
all
these
elements
of
strength
the
republicans
held
the
presidency
from
to
the
three
presidents
elected
in
this
period
grant
hayes
and
garfield
had
certain
striking
characteristics
in
common
they
were
all
of
origin
humble
enough
to
please
the
most
exacting
jacksonian
democrat
they
had
been
generals
in
the
union
army
grant
next
to
lincoln
was
regarded
as
the
savior
of
the
constitution
hayes
and
garfield
though
lesser
lights
in
the
military
firmament
had
honorable
records
duly
appreciated
by
veterans
of
the
war
now
thoroughly
organized
into
the
grand
army
of
the
republic
it
is
true
that
grant
was
not  politician
and
had
never
voted
the
republican
ticket
but
this
was
readily
overlooked
hayes
and
garfield
on
the
other
hand
were
loyal
party
men
the
former
had
served
in
congress
and
for
three
terms
as
governor
of
his
state
the
latter
had
long
been  member
of
the
house
of
representatives
and
was
senator
elect
when
he
received
the
nomination
for
president
all
of
them
possessed
moreover
another
important
asset
which
was
not
forgotten
by
the
astute
managers
who
led
in
selecting
candidates
all
of
them
were
from
ohio
though
grant
had
been
in
illinois
when
the
summons
to
military
duties
came
and
ohio
was  strategic
state
it
lay
between
the
manufacturing
east
and
the
agrarian
country
to
the
west
having
growing
industries
and
wool
to
sell
it
benefited
from
the
protective
tariff
yet
being
mainly
agricultural
still
it
was
not
without
sympathy
for
the
farmers
who
showed
low
tariff
or
free
trade
tendencies
whatever
share
the
east
had
in
shaping
laws
and
framing
policies
it
was
clear
that
the
west
was
to
have
the
candidates
this
division
in
privileges
not
uncommon
in
political
management
was
always
accompanied
by  judicious
selection
of
the
candidate
for
vice
president
with
garfield
for
example
was
associated  prominent
new
york
politician
chester  arthur
who
as
fate
decreed
was
destined
to
more
than
three
years
service
as
chief
magistrate
on
the
assassination
of
his
superior
in
office
the
disputed
election
of
while
taking
note
of
the
long
years
of
republican
supremacy
it
must
be
recorded
that
grave
doubts
exist
in
the
minds
of
many
historians
as
to
whether
one
of
the
three
presidents
hayes
was
actually
the
victor
in
or
not
his
democratic
opponent
samuel  tilden
received  popular
plurality
of  quarter
of  million
and
had  plausible
claim
to  majority
of
the
electoral
vote
at
all
events
four
states
sent
in
double
returns
one
set
for
tilden
and
another
for
hayes
and  deadlock
ensued
both
parties
vehemently
claimed
the
election
and
the
passions
ran
so
high
that
sober
men
did
not
shrink
from
speaking
of
civil
war
again
fortunately
in
the
end
the
counsels
of
peace
prevailed
congress
provided
for
an
electoral
commission
of
fifteen
men
to
review
the
contested
returns
the
democrats
inspired
by
tilden  moderation
accepted
the
judgment
in
favor
of
hayes
even
though
they
were
not
convinced
that
he
was
really
entitled
to
the
office
the
growth
of
opposition
to
republican
rule
abuses
in
american
political
life
during
their
long
tenure
of
office
the
republicans
could
not
escape
the
inevitable
consequences
of
power
that
is
evil
practices
and
corrupt
conduct
on
the
part
of
some
who
found
shelter
within
the
party
for
that
matter
neither
did
the
democrats
manage
to
avoid
such
difficulties
in
those
states
and
cities
where
they
had
the
majority
in
new
york
city
for
instance
the
local
democratic
organization
known
as
tammany
hall
passed
under
the
sway
of  group
of
politicians
headed
by
boss
tweed
he
plundered
the
city
treasury
until
public
spirited
citizens
supported
by
samuel  tilden
the
democratic
leader
of
the
state
rose
in
revolt
drove
the
ringleader
from
power
and
sent
him
to
jail
in
philadelphia
the
local
republican
bosses
were
guilty
of
offenses
as
odious
as
those
committed
by
new
york
politicians
indeed
the
decade
that
followed
the
civil
war
was
marred
by
so
many
scandals
in
public
life
that
one
acute
editor
was
moved
to
inquire
are
not
all
the
great
communities
of
the
western
world
growing
more
corrupt
as
they
grow
in
wealth
in
the
sphere
of
national
politics
where
the
opportunities
were
greater
betrayals
of
public
trust
were
even
more
flagrant
one
revelation
after
another
showed
officers
high
and

as

on

many  distinguished

james

thought
he

decline
in

in

he
had
exclaimed
there
is
something
magnificent
in

to
love
ten
years
later
when
asked

at

tears
at

advance
in
one
poor
hundred
years
when
his
critics
condemned
him
for
this
attack
upon
his
native
land
lowell
replied
in
sadness
these
fellows
have
no
notion
of
what
love
of
country
means
it
was
in
my
very
blood
and
bones
if  am
not
an
american
who
ever
was
what
fills
me
with
doubt
and
dismay
is
the
degradation
of
the
moral
tone
is
it
or
is
it
not  result
of
democracy
is

of

for
the

or  kakistocracy  government
of
the
worst
rather
for
the
benefit
of
knaves
at
the
cost
of
fools
the
reform
movement
in
republican
ranks
the
sentiments
expressed
by
lowell
himself  republican
and
for  time
american
ambassador
to
england
were
shared
by
many
men
in
his
party
very
soon
after
the
close
of
the
civil
war
some
of
them
began
to
protest
vigorously
against
the
policies
and
conduct
of
their
leaders
in
the
dissenters
calling
themselves
liberal
republicans
broke
away
altogether
nominated  candidate
of
their
own
horace
greeley
and
put
forward  platform
indicting
the
republican
president
fiercely
enough
to
please
the
most
uncompromising
democrat
they
accused
grant
of
using
the
powers
and
opportunities
of
his
high
office
for
the
promotion
of
personal
ends
they
charged
him
with
retaining
notoriously
corrupt
and
unworthy
men
in
places
of
power
and
responsibility
they
alleged
that
the
republican
party
kept
alive
the
passions
and
resentments
of
the
late
civil
war
to
use
them
for
their
own
advantages
and
employed
the
public
service
of
the
government
as  machinery
of
corruption
and
personal
influence
it
was
not
apparent
however
from
the
ensuing
election
that
any
considerable
number
of
republicans
accepted
the
views
of
the
liberals
greeley
though
indorsed
by
the
democrats
was
utterly
routed
and
died
of  broken
heart
the
lesson
of
his
discomfiture
seemed
to
be
that
independent
action
was
futile
so
at
least
it
was
regarded
by
most
men
of
the
rising
generation
like
henry
cabot
lodge
of
massachusetts
and
theodore
roosevelt
of
new
york
profiting
by
the
experience
of
greeley
they
insisted
in
season
and
out
that
reformers
who
desired
to
rid
the
party
of
abuses
should
remain
loyal
to
it
and
do
their
work
on
the
inside
the
mugwumps
and
cleveland
democracy
in
though
aided
by
republican
dissensions
the
democrats
were
slow
in
making
headway
against
the
political
current
they
were
deprived
of
the
energetic
and
capable
leadership
once
afforded
by
the
planters
like
calhoun
davis
and
toombs
they
were
saddled
by
their
opponents
with
responsibility
for
secession
and
they
were
stripped
of
the
support
of
the
prostrate
south
not
until
the
last
southern
state
was
restored
to
the
union
not
until  general
amnesty
was
wrung
from
congress
not
until
white
supremacy
was
established
at
the
polls
and
the
last
federal
soldier
withdrawn
from
southern
capitals
did
they
succeed
in
capturing
the
presidency
the
opportune
moment
for
them
came
in
when  number
of
circumstances
favored
their
aspirations
the
republicans
leaving
the
ohio
valley
in
their
search
for  candidate
nominated
james
blaine
of
maine  vigorous
and
popular
leader
but  man
under
fire
from
the
reformers
in
his
own
party
the
democrats
on
their
side
were
able
to
find
at
this
juncture
an
able
candidate
who
had
no
political
enemies
in
the
sphere
of
national
politics
grover
cleveland
then
governor
of
new
york
and
widely
celebrated
as  man
of
sterling
honesty
at
the

espoused

called
them

and
laughed
at
them
as
the
men

dilettanti
and
carpet
knights
of

they
had  following
that
was
not
to
be
despised
the
campaign
which
took
place
that
year
was
one
of
the
most
savage
in
american
history
issues
were
thrust
into
the
background
the
tariff
though
mentioned
was
not
taken
seriously
abuse
of
the
opposition
was
the
favorite
resource
of
party
orators
the
democrats
insisted
that
the
republican
party
so
far
as
principle
is
concerned
is  reminiscence
in
practice
it
is
an
organization
for
enriching
those
who
control
its
machinery
for
the
republican
candidate
blaine
they
could
hardly
find
words
to
express
their
contempt
the
republicans
retaliated
in
kind
they
praised
their
own
good
works
as
of
old
in
saving
the
union
and
denounced
the
fraud
and
violence
practiced
by
the
democracy
in
the
southern
states
seeing
little
objectionable
in
the
public
record
of
cleveland
as
mayor
of
buffalo
and
governor
of
new
york
they
attacked
his
personal
character
perhaps
never
in
the
history
of
political
campaigns
did
the
discussions
on
the
platform
and
in
the
press
sink
to
so
low  level
decent
people
were
sickened
even
hot
partisans
shrank
from
their
own
words
when
after
the
election
they
had
time
to
reflect
on
their
heedless
passions
moreover
nothing
was
decided
by
the
balloting
cleveland
was
elected
but
his
victory
was  narrow
one  change
of  few
hundred
votes
in
new
york
would
have
sent
his
opponent
to
the
white
house
instead
changing
political
fortunes
after
the
democrats
had
settled
down
to
the
enjoyment
of
their
hard
earned
victory
president
cleveland
in
his
message
of
attacked
the
tariff
as
vicious
inequitable
and
illogical
as  system
of
taxation
that

upon

consumer
in

for

you
see
your

come
out

with
no

the

hill
was
seeking
permanent
settlers
who
would
produce
manufacture
and
use
the
railways
as
the
means
of
exchange
consequently
he
fixed
low
rates
and
let
his
passengers
take  good
deal
of
live
stock
and
household
furniture
free
by
doing
this
he
made
an
appeal
that
was
answered
by
eager

in
the
vanguard
of

seekers
left

coaches

ten

that
followed
people
from

middle
west
and
the
south
responding
to
his
call
went
to
the
western
country
where
they
brought
eight
million
acres
of
prairie
land
under
cultivation
when
hill
got
his
people
on
the
land
he
took
an
interest
in
everything
that
increased
the
productivity
of
their
labor
was
the
output
of
food
for
his
freight
cars
limited
by
bad
drainage
on
the

hill
then
interested
himself
in
practical
ways
of
ditching
and
tiling
were
farmers
hampered
in
hauling
their
goods
to
his
trains
by
bad
roads
in
that
case
he
urged
upon
the
states
the
improvement
of
highways
did
the
traffic
slacken
because
the
food
shipped
was
not
of
the
best
quality
then
live
stock
must
be
improved
and
scientific

promoted
did
the

need

hill
was
an
active
participant
his
was
the
long
vision
seeing
in
conservation
and
permanent
improvements
the
foundation
of
prosperity
for
the
railways
and
the
people
indeed
he
neglected
no
opportunity
to
increase
the
traffic
on
the
lines
he
wanted
no
empty
cars
running
in
either
direction
and
no
wheat
stored
in
warehouses
for
the
lack
of
markets
so
he
looked
to
the
orient
as
well
as
to
europe
as
an
outlet
for
the
surplus
of
the
farms
he
sent
agents
to
china
and
japan
to
discover
what
american
goods
and
produce
those
countries
would
consume
and
what
manufactures
they
had
to
offer
to
americans
in
exchange
to
open
the
pacific
trade
he
bought
two
ocean
monsters
the
minnesota
and
the
dakota
thus
preparing
for
emergencies
west
as
well
as
east
when
some
japanese
came
to
the
united
states
on
their
way
to
europe
to
buy

hill
showed

how
easy
it
was
for
them
to
make
their
purchase
in
this
country
and

by

railways
and
american

so
the

builder
and
promoter
who
helped
to
break
the
virgin
soil
of
the
prairies
lived
through
the
pioneer
epoch
and
into
the
age
of
great
finance
before
he
died
he
saw

fields
of
north
dakota
linked
with
the
spinning
jennies
of
manchester
and
the

of
yokohama
the
evolution
of

the
removal
of
the

unlike
the

of
new

in
colonial
days
or
that
of
kentucky
later
the
advancing

builders
in

had
his
fatal
battle
with
the
sioux
in
and
there
were
minor
brushes
but
they
were
all
of
relatively
slight
consequence
the
former
practice
of
treating
with
the
indians
as
independent
nations
was
abandoned
in
and
most
of
them
were
concentrated
in
reservations
where
they
were
mainly
supported
by
the
government
the
supervision
of
their
affairs
was
vested
in  board
of
commissioners
created
in
and
instructed
to
treat
them
as
wards
of
the
nation  trust
which
unfortunately
was
often
betrayed  further
step
in
indian
policy
was
taken
in
when
provision
was
made
for
issuing
lands
to
individual
indians
thus
permitting
them
to
become
citizens
and
settle
down
among
their
white
neighbors
as
farmers
or
cattle
raisers
the
disappearance
of
the
buffalo
the
main
food
supply
of
the
wild
indians
had
made
them
more
tractable
and
more
willing
to
surrender
the
freedom
of
the

the
routine
of
the

the

between

were

in

reaches
suitable
for

were

outlet
for

there
sprang
up
to
the
westward
cattle
and
sheep
raising
on
an
immense
scale
the
far
famed
american
cowboy
was
the
hero
in
this
scene
great
herds
of
cattle
were
bred
in
texas
with
the
advancing
spring
and
summer
seasons
they
were
driven
northward
across
the
plains
and
over
the
buffalo
trails
in  single
year
it
is
estimated
that
nearly
one
million
head
of
cattle
were
moved
out
of
texas
to
the
north
by
four
thousand
cowboys
supplied
with
horses
and
ponies
during
the
two
decades
from
to
both
the
cattle
men
and
the
sheep
raisers
had
an
almost
free
run
of
the
plains
using
public
lands
without
paying
for
the
privilege
and
waging
war
on
one
another
over
the
possession
of
ranges
at
length
however
both
had
to
go
as
the
homesteaders
and
land
companies
came
and
fenced
in
the
plain
and
desert
with
endless
lines
of
barbed
wire
already
in  writer
familiar
with
the

lamented
the
passing
of
the
picturesque
days
the
unique
position
of
the
cowboys
among
the
americans
is
jeopardized
in  thousand
ways
towns
are
growing
up
on
their
pasture
lands
irrigation
schemes
of  dozen
sorts
threaten
to
turn
bunch
grass
scenery
into

farmers
are
pre
empting

and
the
sides
of
waterways
and
the
day
is
not
far
distant
when
stock
raising
must
be
done
mainly
in
small
herds
with
winter
corrals
and
then
the
cowboy  days
will
end
even
now
his
condition
disappoints
those
who
knew
him
only
half  dozen
years
ago
his
breed
seems
to
have
deteriorated
and
his
ranks
are
filling
with
men
who
work
for
wages
rather
than
for
the
love
of
the
free
life
and
bold
companionship

all
the

in

all

the

already
settlement
under
the
homestead
act
of
two
factors
gave  special
stimulus
to
the
rapid
settlement
of
western
lands
which
swept
away
the
indians
and
the
cattle
rangers
the
first
was
the
policy
of
the
railway
companies
in
selling
large
blocks
of
land
received
from
the
government
at
low
prices
to
induce
immigration
the
second
was
the
operation
of
the
homestead
law
passed
in
this
measure
practically
closed
the
long
controversy
over
the
disposition
of
the
public
domain
that
was
suitable
for
agriculture
it
provided
for
granting
without
any
cost
save  small
registration
fee
public
lands
in
lots
of
acres
each
to
citizens
and
aliens
who
declared
their
intention
of
becoming
citizens
the
one
important
condition
attached
was
that
the
settler
should
occupy
the
farm
for
five
years
before
his
title
was
finally
confirmed
even
this
stipulation
was
waived
in
the
case
of
the
civil
war
veterans
who
were
allowed
to
count
their
term
of
military
service
as  part
of
the
five
years
occupancy
required
as
the
soldiers
of
the
revolutionary
and
mexican
wars
had
advanced
in
great
numbers
to
the
frontier
in
earlier
days
so
now
veterans
led
in
the
settlement
of
the
middle
border
along
with
them
went
thousands
of
german
irish
and
scandinavian
immigrants
fresh
from
the
old
world
between
and
acres
were
staked
out
in
quarter
section
farms
in
twenty
years
the
population
of
nebraska
leaped
from
to
almost
half  million
kansas
from
to  million
iowa
from
to
and
the
dakotas
from
to
the
diversity
of
western
agriculture
in
soil
produce
and
management
western
agriculture
presented
many
contrasts
to
that
of
the
east
and
south
in
the
region
of
arable
and
watered
lands
the
typical
american
unit
the
small
farm
tilled
by
the
owner
appeared
as
usual
but
by
the
side
of
it
many  huge
domain
owned
by
foreign
or
eastern
companies
and
tilled
by
hired
labor
sometimes
the
great
estate
took
the
shape
of
the
bonanza
farm
devoted
mainly
to
wheat
and
corn
and
cultivated
on  large
scale
by
machinery
again
it
assumed
the
form
of
the
cattle
ranch
embracing
tens
of
thousands
of
acres
again
it
was  vast
holding
of
diversified
interest
such
as
the
santa
anita
ranch
near
los
angeles  domain
of
acres
cultivated
in  glorious
sweep
of
vineyards
and
orange
and
olive
orchards
rich
sheep
and
cattle
pastures
and
horse
ranches
their
life
and
customs
handed
down
from
the
spanish
owners
of
the
various
ranches
which
were
swept
into
one
estate
irrigation
in
one
respect
agriculture
in
the
far
west
was
unique
in  large
area
spreading
through
eight
states
montana
idaho
wyoming
utah
colorado
nevada
arizona
new
mexico
and
parts
of
adjoining
states
the
rainfall
was
so
slight
that
the
ordinary
crops
to
which
the
american
farmer
was
accustomed
could
not
be
grown
at
all
the
mormons
were
the
first
anglo
saxons
to
encounter
aridity
and
they
were
baffled
at
first
but
they
studied
it
and
mastered
it
by
magnificent
irrigation
systems
as
other
settlers
poured
into
the
west
the
problem
of
the
desert
was
attacked
with  will
some
of
them
replying
to
the
commiseration
of
eastern
farmers
by
saying
that
it
was
easier
to
scoop
out
an
irrigation
ditch
than
to
cut
forests
and
wrestle
with
stumps
and
stones
private
companies
bought
immense
areas
at
low
prices
built
irrigation
works
and
disposed
of
their
lands
in
small
plots
some
ranchers
with
an
instinct
for
water
like
that
of
the
miner
for
metal
sank
wells
into
the
dry
sand
and
were
rewarded
with
gushers
that
soused
the
thirsty
desert
and
turned
its
good
for
nothing
sand
into
good
for
anything
loam
the
federal
government
came
to
the
aid
of
the
arid
regions
in
by
granting
lands
to
the
states
to
be
used
for
irrigation
purposes
in
this
work
wyoming
took
the
lead
with  law
which
induced
capitalists
to
invest
in
irrigation
and
at
the
same
time
provided
for
the
sale
of
the
redeemed
lands
to
actual
settlers
finally
in
the
federal
government
by
its
liberal
reclamation
act
added
its
strength
to
that
of
individuals
companies
and
states
in
conquering
arid
america
nowhere
writes
powell  historian
of
the
west
in
his
picturesque
end
of
the
trail
has
the
white
man
fought  more
courageous
fight
or
won  more
brilliant
victory
than
in
arizona
his
weapons
have
been
the
transit
and
the
level
the
drill
and
the
dredge
the
pick
and
the
spade
and
the
enemy
which
he
has
conquered
has
been
the
most
stubborn
of
all
foes
the
hostile
forces
of
nature
the
story
of
how
the
white
man
within
the
space
of
less
than
thirty
years
penetrated
explored
and
mapped
this
almost
unknown
region
of
how
he
carried
law
order
and
justice
into  section
which
had
never
had
so
much
as  speaking
acquaintance
with
any
one
of
the
three
before
of
how
realizing
the
necessity
for
means
of
communication
he
built
highways
of
steel
across
this
territory
from
east
to
west
and
from
north
to
south
of
how
undismayed
by
the
savageness
of
the
countenance
which
the
desert
turned
upon
him
he
laughed
and
rolled
up
his
sleeves
and
spat
upon
his
hands
and
slashed
the
face
of
the
desert
with
canals
and
irrigating
ditches
and
filled
those
ditches
with
water
brought
from
deep
in
the
earth
or
high
in
the
mountains
and
of
how
in
the
conquered
and
submissive
soil
he
replaced
the
aloe
with
alfalfa
the
mesquite
with
maize
the
cactus
with
cotton
forms
one
of
the
most
inspiring
chapters
in
our
history
it
is
one
of
the
epics
of
civilization
this
reclamation
of
the
southwest
and
its
heroes
thank
god
are
americans
other
desert
regions
have
been
redeemed
by
irrigation
egypt
for
example
and
mesopotamia
and
parts
of
the
sudan
but
the
people
of
all
those
regions
lay
stretched
out
in
the
shade
of  convenient
palm
metaphorically
speaking
and
waited
for
some
one
with
more
energy
than
themselves
to
come
along
and
do
the
work
but
the
arizonians
mindful
of
the
fact
that
god
the
government
and
carnegie
help
those
who
help
themselves
spent
their
days
wielding
the
pick
and
shovel
and
their
evenings
in
writing
letters
to
washington
with
toil
hardened
hands
after  time
the
government
was
prodded
into
action
and
the
great
dams
at
laguna
and
roosevelt
are
the
result
then
the
people
organizing
themselves
into
cooperative
leagues
and
water
users
associations
took
up
the
work
of
reclamation
where
the
government
left
off
it

to
these
energetic
persevering
men
who
have
drilled

plowed

dug

through
the

of
that
great
region
which
stretches
from

that
the
metamorphosis
of

other
peculiar
features
which
made  lasting
impression
on
western
economic
life
mining
lumbering
and
fruit
growing
for
instance
employed
thousands
of
workers
during
the
rush
months
and
turned
them
out
at

the
inevitable
result
was
an
army
of
migratory
laborers
wandering
from
camp
to
camp
from
town
to
town
and
from
ranch
to
ranch
without
fixed
homes
or
established
habits
of

from

extraordinary
condition
there
issued
many  long
and
lawless

giving  distinct
color
to
the

movement
in
whole
sections
of
the
mountain

states
the
admission
of

the
spirit
of
self
government
the
instinct
of
self
government
was
strong
in
the
western
communities
in
the
very
beginning
it
led
to
the
organization
of
volunteer
committees
known
as
vigilantes
to
suppress
crime
and
punish
criminals
as
soon
as
enough
people
were
settled
permanently
in  region
they
took
care
to
form  more
stable
kind
of
government
an
illustration
of
this
process
is
found
in
the
oregon
compact
made
by
the
pioneers
in
the
spirit
of
which
is
reflected
in
an
editorial

claim

any

which
from

from

is
so
situated

not

as
may
be
necessary
for

safety
protection
and

always
with
the

that
they
shall
at
the
earliest
moment
when
the

shall
extend
an
effective

give
it
their
unqualified

people
who
turned
so
naturally
to
the
organization
of
local

were
equally
eager
for
admission
to
the

as
soon
as
any
shadow
of  claim
to
statehood
could
be
advanced
as
long
as  region
was
merely
one
of
the
territories
of
the
united

the
appointment
of
the

and
other
officers
was
controlled
by
politics
at
washington
moreover
the
disposition
of
land
mineral
rights
forests
and
water
power
was
also
in
the
hands
of
national
leaders
thus
practical
considerations
were
united
with
the
spirit
of
independence
in
the
quest
for
local
autonomy
nebraska
and
colorado
two
states
nebraska
and
colorado
had
little
difficulty
in
securing
admission
to
the
union
the
first
nebraska
had
been
organized
as  territory
by
the
famous
kansas
nebraska
bill
which
did
so
much
to
precipitate
the
civil
war
lying
to
the
north
of
kansas
which
had
been
admitted
in
it
escaped
the
invasion
of
slave
owners
from
missouri
and
was
settled
mainly
by
farmers
from
the
north
though
it
claimed  population
of
only
it
was
regarded
with
kindly
interest
by
the
republican
congress
at
washington
and
reduced
to
its
present
boundaries
it
received
the
coveted
statehood
in
this
was
hardly
accomplished
before
the
people
of
colorado
to
the
southwest
began
to
make
known
their
demands
they
had
been
organized
under
territorial
government
in
when
they
numbered
only  handful
but
within
ten
years
the
aspect
of
their
affairs
had
completely
changed
the
silver
and
gold
deposits
of
the
leadville
and
cripple
creek
regions
had
attracted
an
army
of
miners
and
prospectors
the
city
of
denver
founded
in
and
named
after
the
governor
of
kansas
whence
came
many
of
the
early

had
grown
from  straggling

of
log
huts
into  prosperous
center
of

by
it
was
reckoned
that
the
population
of
the
territory
was
not
less
than
one
hundred
thousand
the
following
year
congress
yielding
to
the
popular
appeal
made
colorado  member
of
the
american
union
six
new
states
for
many
years
there
was  deadlock
in
congress
over
the
admission
of
new
states
the
spell
was
broken
in
under
the
leadership
of
the
dakotas
for  long
time
the
dakota
territory
organized
in
had
been
looked
upon
as
the
home
of
the
powerful
sioux
indians
whose
enormous
reservation
blocked
the
advance
of
the
frontier
the
discovery
of
gold
in
the
black
hills
however
marked
their
doom
even
before
congress
could
open
their
lands
to
prospectors
pioneers
were
swarming
over
the
country
farmers
from
the
adjoining
minnesota
and
the
eastern
states
scandinavians
germans
and
canadians
came
in
swelling
waves
to
occupy
the
fertile
dakota
lands
now
famous
even
as
far
away
as
the

of

seldom
had
the
plow
of
man
cut
through
richer
soil
than
was
found
in
the
bottoms
of
the
red
river
valley
and
it
became
all
the
more
precious
when
the
opening
of
the
northern
pacific
in
afforded  means
of
transportation
east
and
west
the
population
which
had
numbered
in
passed
the
half
million
mark
before
ten
years
had
elapsed
remembering
that
nebraska
had
been
admitted
with
only
inhabitants
the
dakotans
could
not
see
why
they
should
be
kept
under
federal
tutelage
at
the
same
time
washington
far
away
on
the

coast
montana
idaho
and

boasting
of

put
in
their

pleas
but
the
members
of

were
busy
with
politics
the
democrats
saw
no
good
reason
for
admitting
new
republican
states
until
after
their
defeat
in
near
the
end
of
their
term
the
next
year
they
opened
the
door
for
north
and
south
dakota
washington

in  republican

idaho
and

into
the

had
been
granted
twenty
one
years
before
utah
although
utah
had
long
presented
all
the
elements
of  well
settled
and
industrious
community
its
admission
to
the
union
was
delayed
on
account
of
popular
hostility
to
the
practice
of
polygamy
the
custom
it
is
true
had
been
prohibited
by
act
of
congress
in
but
the
law
had
been
systematically
evaded
in
congress
made
another
and
more
effective
effort
to
stamp
out
polygamy
five
years
later
it
even
went
so
far
as
to
authorize
the
confiscation
of
the
property
of
the
mormon
church
in
case
the
practice
of
plural
marriages
was
not
stopped
meanwhile
the
gentile
or
non
mormon
population
was
steadily
increasing
and
the
leaders
in
the
church
became
convinced
that
the
battle
against
the
sentiment
of
the
country
was
futile
at
last
in
utah
was
admitted
as  state
under  constitution
which
forbade
plural

supplanted
them
both
in
agrarian
economy
the
west
became
the
granary
of
the
east
and
of
western
europe
the
scoop
shovel
once
used
to
handle
grain
was
superseded
by
the
towering
elevator
loading
and
unloading
thousands
of
bushels
every
hour
the
refrigerator
car
and
ship
made
the
packing
industry
as
stable
as
the
production
of
cotton
or
corn
and
gave
an
immense
impetus
to
cattle
raising
and
sheep
farming
so
the
meat
of
the
west
took
its
place
on
the
english
dinner
table
by
the
side
of
bread
baked
from
dakotan
wheat
aid
in
american
economic
independence
the
effects
of
this
economic
movement
were
manifold
and
striking
billions
of
dollars
worth
of
american
grain
dairy
produce
and
meat
were
poured
into
european
markets
where
they
paid
off
debts
due
money
lenders
and
acquired
capital
to
develop
american
resources
thus
they
accelerated
the
progress
of
american
financiers
toward
national
independence
the
country
which
had
timidly
turned
to
the
old
world
for
capital
in
hamilton  day
and
had
borrowed
at
high
rates
of
interest
in
london
in
lincoln  day
moved
swiftly
toward
the
time
when
it
would
be
among
the
world  first
bankers
and
money
lenders
itself
every
grain
of
wheat
and
corn
pulled
the
balance
down
on
the
american
side
of
the
scale
eastern
agriculture
affected
in
the
east
as
well
as
abroad
the
opening
of
the
western
granary
produced
momentous
results
the
agricultural
economy
of
that
part
of
the
country
was
changed
in
many
respects
whole
sections
of
the
poorest
land
went
almost
out
of
cultivation
the
abandoned
farms
of
the
new
england
hills
bearing
solemn
witness
to
the
competing
power
of
western
wheat
fields
sheep
and
cattle
raising
as
well
as
wheat
and
corn
production
suffered
at
least  relative
decline
thousands
of
farmers
cultivating
land
of
the
lower
grade
were
forced
to
go
west
or
were
driven
to
the
margin
of
subsistence
even
the
herds
that
supplied
eastern
cities
with
milk
were
fed
upon
grain
brought
halfway
across
the
continent
the
expansion
of
the
american
market
upon
industry
as
well
as
agriculture
the
opening
of
vast
food
producing
regions
told
in  thousand
ways
the
demand
for
farm
machinery
clothing
boots
shoes
and
other
manufactures
gave
to
american
industries
such  market
as
even
hamilton
had
never
foreseen
moreover
it
helped
to
expand
far
into
the
mississippi
valley
the
industrial
area
once
confined
to
the
northern
seaboard
states
and
to
transform
the
region
of
the
great
lakes
into
an
industrial
empire
herein
lies
the
explanation
of
the
growth
of
mid
western
cities
after
chicago
with
its
thirty
five
railways
tapped
every
locality
of
the
west
and
south
to
the
railways
were
added
the
water
routes
of
the
lakes
thus
creating  strategic
center
for
industries
long
foresight
carried
the
mccormick
reaper
works
to
chicago
before
from
troy
new
york
went  large
stove
plant
that
was
followed
by  shoe
factory
from
massachusetts
the
packing
industry
rose
as  matter
of
course
at  point
so
advantageous
for
cattle
raisers
and
shippers
and
so
well
connected
with
eastern
markets
to
the
opening
of
the
far
west
also
the
lake
region
was
indebted
for  large
part
of
that
water
borne
traffic
which
made
it
the
mediterranean
basin
of
north
america
the
produce
of
the
west
and
the
manufactures
of
the
east
poured
through
it
in
an
endless
stream
the
swift
growth
of
shipbuilding
on
the
great
lakes
helped
to
compensate
for
the
decline
of
the
american
marine
on
the
high
seas
in
response
to
this
stimulus
detroit
could
boast
that
her
shipwrights
were
able
to
turn
out  ten
thousand
ton
leviathan
for
ore
or
grain
about
as
quickly
as
carpenters
could
put
up
an
eight
room
house
thus
in
relation
to
the
far
west
the
old
northwest
territory
the
wilderness
of
jefferson  time
had
taken
the
position
formerly
occupied
by
new
england
alone
it
was
supplying
capital
and
manufactures
for  vast
agricultural
empire
west
and
south
america
on
the
pacific
it
has
been
said
that
the
mediterranean
sea
was
the
center
of
ancient
civilization
that
modern
civilization
has
developed
on
the
shores
of
the
atlantic
and
that
the
future
belongs
to
the
pacific
at
any
rate
the
sweep
of
the
united
states
to
the
shores
of
the
pacific
quickly
exercised  powerful
influence
on
world
affairs
and
it
undoubtedly
has  still
greater
significance
for
the
future
very
early
regular
traffic
sprang
up
between
the
pacific
ports
and
the
hawaiian
islands
china
and
japan
two
years
before
the
adjustment
of
the
oregon
controversy
with
england
namely
in
the
united

had
established
official
and
trading
relations
with
china
ten
years
later
four
years
after
the
admission
of
california
to
the
union
the
barred
door
of
japan
was
forced
open
by
commodore
perry
the
commerce
which
had
long
before
developed
between
the
pacific
ports
and
hawaii
china
and
japan
now
flourished
under
official
care
in  ship
from
honolulu
carried
sugar
molasses
and
fruits
from
hawaii
to
the
oregon
port
of
astoria
the
next
year  vessel
from
hongkong
brought
rice
mats
and
tea
from
china
an
era
of
lucrative
trade
was
opened
the
annexation
of

in
the
addition
of

at
the
same
time
and
the
participation
of
american
troops
in
the
suppression
of
the

from
an
old

commodore

making

the
disappearance
of

frontier
also
brought
new
and
serious
problems
to
the
governments
of
the
states
and
the
nation
the
people
of
the
whole
united
states
suddenly
were
forced
to
realize
that
there
was  limit
to
the
rich
new
land
to
exploit
and
to
the
forests
and
minerals
awaiting
the
ax
and
the
pick
then
arose
in
america
the
questions
which
had
long
perplexed
the
countries
of
the
old
world
the
scientific
use
of
the
soils
and
conservation
of
natural
resources
hitherto
the
government
had
followed
the
easy
path
of
giving
away
arable
land
and
selling
forest
and
mineral
lands
at
low
prices
now
it
had
to
face
far
more
difficult
and
complex
problems
it
also
had
to
consider
questions
of
land
tenure
again
especially
if
the
ideal
of  nation
of
home
owning
farmers
was
to
be
maintained
while
there
was
plenty
of
land
for
every
man
or
woman
who
wanted  home
on
the
soil
it
made
little
difference
if
single
landlords
or
companies
got
possession
of
millions
of
acres
if  hundred
men
in
one
western
river
valley
owned
acres
but
when
the
good
land
for
small
homesteads
was
all
gone
then
was
raised
the
real
issue
at
the
opening
of
the
twentieth
century
the
nation
which  hundred
years
before
had
land
and
natural
resources
apparently
without
limit
was
compelled
to
enact
law
after
law
conserving
its
forests
and
minerals
then
it
was
that
the
great
state
of
california
on
the
very
border
of
the
continent
felt
constrained
to
enact  land
settlement
measure
providing
government
assistance
in
an
effort
to
break
up
large
holdings
into
small
lots
and
to
make
it
easy
for
actual
settlers
to
acquire
small
farms

for
thirty
years
after

the
leading
political
parties
although
they
engaged
in
heated
presidential
campaigns
were
not
sharply
and
clearly
opposed
on
many
matters
of
vital
significance
during
none
of
that
time
was
there  clash
of
opinion
over
specific
issues
such
as
rent

in
when
jefferson
rode  popular
wave
to
victory
or
again
in
when
jackson  western
hordes
came
sweeping
into
power
the
democrats
who
before
definitely
opposed
protective
tariffs
federal
banking
internal
improvements
and
heavy
taxes
now
spoke
cautiously
on
all
these
points
the
republicans
conscious
of
the
fact
that
they
had
been  minority
of
the
voters
in
and
warned
by
the
early
loss
of
the
house
of
representatives
in
also
moved
with
considerable
prudence
among
the
perplexing
problems
of
the
day
again
and
again
the
votes
in
congress
showed
that
no
clear
line
separated
all
the
democrats
from
all
the
republicans
there
were
republicans
who
favored
tariff
reductions
and
cheap
money
there
were
democrats
who
looked
with
partiality
upon
high
protection
or
with
indulgence
upon
the
contraction
of
the
currency
only
on
matters
relating
to
the
coercion
of
the
south
was
the
division
between
the
parties
fairly
definite
this
could
be
readily
accounted
for
on
practical
as
well
as
sentimental
grounds
after
all
the
vague
criticisms
and
proposals
that
found
their
way
into
the
political
platforms
did
but
reflect
the
confusion
of
mind
prevailing
in
the
country
the
fact
that
out
of
the
eighteen
years
between
and
the
democrats
held
the
house
of
representatives
for
fourteen
years
while
the
republicans
had
every
president
but
one
showed
that
the
voters
like
the
politicians
were
in  state
of
indecision
hayes

but
in

he
had
the
barest
majority
from
to
and
lost
that
altogether
at
the
election
held
in
the
middle
of
his
term
the
opinion
of
the
country
was
evidently
unsettled
and
fluctuating
it
was
still
distracted
by
memories
of
the
dead
past
and
uncertain
as
to
the
trend
of
the
future
the
currency
question
nevertheless
these
years
of
muddled
politics
and
nebulous
issues
proved
to
be  period
in
which
social
forces
were
gathering
for
the
great
campaign
of
except
for
three
new
features
the
railways
the
trusts
and
the
trade
unions
the
subjects
of
debate
among
the
people
were
the
same
as
those
that
had
engaged
their
attention
since
the
foundation
of
the
republic
the
currency
the
national
debt
banking
the
tariff
and
taxation
debtors
and
the
fall
in
prices
for
many
reasons
the
currency
question
occupied
the
center
of
interest
as
of
old
the
farmers
and
planters
of
the
west
and
south
were
heavily
in
debt
to
the
east
for
borrowed
money
secured
by
farm
mortgages
and
they
counted
upon
the
sale
of
cotton
corn
wheat
and
hogs
to
meet
interest
and
principal
when
due
during
the
war
the
western
farmers
had
been
able
to
dispose
of
their
produce
at
high
prices
and
thus
discharge
their
debts
with
comparative
ease
but
after
the
war
prices
declined
wheat
that
sold
at
two
dollars  bushel
in
brought
sixty
four
cents
twenty
years
later
the
meaning
of
this
for
the
farmers
in
debt
and
nearly
three
fourths
of
them
were
in
that
class
can
be
shown
by  single
illustration  thousand
dollar
mortgage
on  western
farm
could
be
paid
off
by
five
hundred
bushels
of
wheat
when
prices
were
high
whereas
it
took
about
fifteen
hundred
bushels
to
pay
the
same
debt
when
wheat
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
scale
for
the
farmer
it
must
be
remembered
wheat
was
the
measure
of
his
labor
the
product
of
his
toil
under
the
summer
sun
and
in
its
price
he
found
the
test
of
his
prosperity
creditors
and
falling
prices
to
the
bondholders
or
creditors
on
the
other
hand
falling
prices
were
clear
gain
if  fifty
dollar
coupon
on  bond
bought
seventy
or
eighty
bushels
of
wheat
instead
of
twenty
or
thirty
the
advantage
to
the
owner
of
the
coupon
was
obvious
moreover
the
advantage
seemed
to
him
entirely
just
creditors
had
suffered
heavy
losses
when
the
civil
war
carried
prices
skyward
while
the
interest
rates
on
their
old
bonds
remained
stationary
for
example
if  man
had  bond
issued
before
and
paying
interest
at
five
per
cent
he
received
fifty
dollars  year
from
it
before
the
war
each
dollar
would
buy  bushel
of
wheat
in
it
would
only
buy
half  bushel
when
prices
that
is
the
cost
of
living
began
to
go
down
creditors
therefore
generally
regarded
the
change
with
satisfaction
as  return
to
normal
conditions
the
cause
of
falling
prices
the
fall
in
prices
was
due
no
doubt
to
many
factors
among
them
must
be
reckoned
the
discontinuance
of
government
buying
for
war
purposes
labor
saving
farm
machinery
immigration
and
the
opening
of
new
wheat
growing
regions
the
currency
too
was
an
element
in
the
situation
whatever
the
cause
the
discontented
farmers
believed
that
the
way
to
raise
prices
was
to
issue
more
money
they
viewed
it
as  case
of
supply
and
demand
if
there
was  small
volume
of
currency
in
circulation
prices
would
be
low
if
there
was  large
volume
prices
would
be
high
hence
they
looked
with
favor
upon
all
plans
to
increase
the
amount
of
money
in
circulation
first
they
advocated
more
paper
notes
greenbacks
and
then
they
turned
to
silver
as
the
remedy
the
creditors
on
the
other
hand
naturally
approved
the
reduction
of
the
volume
of
currency
they
wished
to
see
the
greenbacks
withdrawn
from
circulation
and
gold  metal
more
limited
in
volume
than
silver
made
the
sole
basis
of
the
national
monetary
system
the
battle
over
the
greenbacks
the
contest
between
these
factions
began
as
early
as
in
that
year
congress
enacted  law
authorizing
the
treasury
to
withdraw
the
greenbacks
from
circulation
the
paper
money
party
set
up  shrill
cry
of
protest
and
kept
up
the
fight
until
in
it
forced
congress
to
provide
for
the
continuous
re
issue
of
the
legal
tender
notes
as
they
came
into
the
treasury
in
payment
of
taxes
and
other
dues
then
could
the
friends
of
easy
money
rejoice
thou
greenback
tis
of
thee
fair
money
of
the
free
of
thee
we
sing
resumption
of
specie
payment
there
was
however
another
side
to
this
victory
the
opponents
of
the
greenbacks
unable
to
stop
the
circulation
of
paper
induced
congress
to
pass  law
in
providing
that
on
and
after
january
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
shall
redeem
in
coin
the
united
states
legal
tender
notes
then
outstanding
on
their
presentation
at
the
office
of
the
assistant
treasurer
of
the
united
states
in
the
city
of
new
york
in
sums
of
not
less
than
fifty
dollars
the
way
to
resume
john
sherman
had
said
is
to
resume
when
the
hour
for
redemption
arrived
the
treasury
was
prepared
with  large
hoard
of
gold
on
the
appointed
day
wrote
the
assistant
secretary
anxiety
reigned
in
the
office
of
the
treasury
hour
after
hour
passed
no
news
from
new
york
inquiry
by
wire
showed
that
all
was
quiet
at
the
close
of
the
day
this
message
came
of
notes
presented
for
coin
of
gold
for
notes
that
was
all
resumption
was
accomplished
with
no
disturbance
by
five  clock
the
news
was
all
over
the
land
and
the
new
york
bankers
were
sipping
their
tea
in
absolute
safety
the
specie
problem
the
parity
of
gold
and
silver
defeated
in
their
efforts
to
stop
the
present
suicidal
and
destructive
policy
of
contraction
the
advocates
of
an
abundant
currency
demanded
an
increase
in
the
volume
of
silver
in
circulation
this
precipitated
one
of
the
sharpest
political
battles
in
american
history
the
issue
turned
on
legal
as
well
as
economic
points
the
constitution
gave
congress
the
power
to
coin
money
and
it
forbade
the
states
to
make
anything
but
gold
and
silver
legal
tender
in
the
payment
of
debts
it
evidently
contemplated
the
use
of
both
metals
in
the
currency
system
such
at
least
was
the
view
of
many
eminent
statesmen
including
no
less  personage
than
james
blaine
the
difficulty
however
lay
in
maintaining
gold
and
silver
coins
on  level
which
would
permit
them
to
circulate
with
equal
facility
obviously
if
the
gold
in  gold
dollar
exceeds
the
value
of
the
silver
in  silver
dollar
on
the
open
market
men
will
hoard
gold
money
and
leave
silver
money
in
circulation
when
for
example
congress
in
fixed
the
ratio
of
the
two
metals
at
one
to
fifteen
one
ounce
of
gold
declared
worth
fifteen
of
silver
it
was
soon
found
that
gold
had
been
undervalued
when
again
in
the
ratio
was
put
at
one
to
sixteen
it
was
found
that
silver
was
undervalued
consequently
the
latter
metal
was
not
brought
in
for
coinage
and
silver
almost
dropped
out
of
circulation
many  silver
dollar
was
melted
down
by
silverware
factories
silver
demonetized
in
so
things
stood
in
at
that
time
congress
in
enacting  mintage
law
discontinued
the
coinage
of
the
standard
silver
dollar
then
practically
out
of
circulation
this
act
was
denounced
later
by
the
friends
of
silver
as
the
crime
of  conspiracy
devised
by
the
money
power
and
secretly
carried
out
this
contention
the
debates
in
congress
do
not
seem
to
sustain
in
the
course
of
the
argument
on
the
mint
law
it
was
distinctly
said
by
one
speaker
at
least
this
bill
provides
for
the
making
of
changes
in
the
legal
tender
coin
of
the
country
and
for
substituting
as
legal
tender
coin
of
only
one
metal
instead
of
two
as
heretofore
the
decline
in
the
value
of
silver
absorbed
in
the
greenback
controversy
the
people
apparently
did
not
appreciate
at
the
time
the
significance
of
the
demonetization
of
silver
but
within  few
years
several
events
united
in
making
it
the
center
of  political
storm
germany
having
abandoned
silver
in
steadily
increased
her
demand
for
gold
three
years
later
the
countries
of
the
latin
union
followed
this
example
thus
helping
to
enhance
the
price
of
the
yellow
metal
all
the
while
new
silver
lodes
discovered
in
the
far
west
were
pouring
into
the
market
great
streams
of
the
white
metal
bearing
down
the
price
then
came
the
resumption
of
specie
payment
which
in
effect
placed
the
paper
money
on  gold
basis
within
twenty
years
silver
was
worth
in
gold
only
about
half
the
price
of
that
there
had
been  real
decline
in
silver
was
denied
by
the
friends
of
that
metal
they
alleged
that
gold
had
gone
up
because
it
had
been
given  monopoly
in
the
coinage
markets
of
civilized
governments
this
monopoly
they
continued
was
the
fruit
of  conspiracy
against
the
people
conceived
by
the
bankers
of
the
world
moreover
they
went
on
the
placing
of
the
greenbacks
on  gold
basis
had
itself
worked  contraction
of
the
currency
it
lowered
the
prices
of
labor
and
produce
to
the
advantage
of
the
holders
of
long
term
investments
bearing  fixed
rate
of
interest
when
wheat
sold
at
sixty
four
cents  bushel
their
search
for
relief
became
desperate
and
they
at
last
concentrated
their
efforts
on
opening
the
mints
of
the
government
for
the
free
coinage
of
silver
at
the
ratio
of
sixteen
to
one
republicans
and
democrats
divided
on
this
question
both
republicans
and
democrats
were
divided
the
line
being
drawn
between
the
east
on
the
one
hand
and
the
south
and
west
on
the
other
rather
than
between
the
two
leading
parties
so
trusted  leader
as
james
blaine
avowed
in  speech
delivered
in
the
senate
in
that
as
the
constitution
required
congress
to
make
both
gold
and
silver
the
money
of
the
land
the
only
question
left
was
that
of
fixing
the
ratio
between
them
he
affirmed
moreover
the
main
contention
of
the
silver
faction
that  reopening
of
the
government
mints
of
the
world
to
silver
would
bring
it
up
to
its
old
relation
with
gold
he
admitted
also
that
their
most
ominous
warnings
were
well
founded
saying  believe
the
struggle
now
going
on
in
this
country
and
in
other
countries
for  single
gold
standard
would
if
successful
produce
widespread
disaster
throughout
the
commercial
world
the
destruction
of
silver
as
money
and
the
establishment
of
gold
as
the
sole
unit
of
value
must
have  ruinous
effect
on
all
forms
of
property
except
those
investments
which
yield  fixed
return
this
was
exactly
the
concession
that
the
silver
party
wanted
three
fourths
of
the
business
enterprises
of
this
country
are
conducted
on
borrowed
capital
said
senator
jones
of
nevada
three
fourths
of
the
homes
and
farms
that
stand
in
the
names
of
the
actual
occupants
have
been
bought
on
time
and  very
large
proportion
of
them
are
mortgaged
for
the
payment
of
some
part
of
the
purchase
money
under
the
operation
of  shrinkage
in
the
volume
of
money
this
enormous
mass
of
borrowers
at
the
maturity
of
their
respective
debts
though
nominally
paying
no
more
than
the
amount
borrowed
with
interest
are
in
reality
in
the
amount
of
the
principal
alone
returning  percentage
of
value
greater
than
they
received
more
in
equity
than
they
contracted
to
pay
in
all
discussions
of
the
subject
the
creditors
attempt
to
brush
aside
the
equities
involved
by
sneering
at
the
debtors
the
silver
purchase
act
even
before
the
actual
resumption
of
specie
payment
the
advocates
of
free
silver
were  power
to
be
reckoned
with
particularly
in
the
democratic
party
they
had  majority
in
the
house
of
representatives
in
and
they
carried  silver
bill
through
that
chamber
blocked
by
the
republican
senate
they
accepted  compromise
in
the
bland
allison
bill
which
provided
for
huge
monthly
purchases
of
silver
by
the
government
for
coinage
into
dollars
so
strong
was
the
sentiment
that  two
thirds
majority
was
mustered
after
president
hayes
vetoed
the
measure
the
effect
of
this
act
as
some
had
anticipated
was
disappointing
it
did
not
stay
silver
on
its
downward
course
thereupon
the
silver
faction
pressed
through
congress
in  bill
providing
for
the
issue
of
paper
certificates
based
on
the
silver
accumulated
in
the
treasury
still
silver
continued
to
fall
then
the
advocates
of
inflation
declared
that
they
would
be
content
with
nothing
short
of
free
coinage
at
the
ratio
of
sixteen
to
one
if
the
issue
had
been
squarely
presented
in
there
is
good
reason
for
believing
that
free
silver
would
have
received  majority
in
both
houses
of
congress
but
it
was
not
presented
the
sherman
silver
purchase
act
and
the
bond
sales
republican
leaders
particularly
from
the
east
stemmed
the
silver
tide
by  diversion
of
forces
they
passed
the
sherman
act
of
providing
for
large
monthly
purchases
of
silver
and
for
the
issue
of
notes
redeemable
in
gold
or
silver
at
the
discretion
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
in  clause
of
superb
ambiguity
they
announced
that
it
was
the
established
policy
of
the
united
states
to
maintain
the
two
metals
on  parity
with
each
other
upon
the
present
legal
ratio
or
such
other
ratio
as
may
be
provided
by
law
for  while
silver
was
buoyed
up
then
it
turned
once
more
on
its
downward
course
in
the
meantime
the
treasury
was
in  sad
plight
to
maintain
the
gold
reserve
president
cleveland
felt
compelled
to
sell
government
bonds
and
to
his
dismay
he
found
that
as
soon
as
the
gold
was
brought
in
at
the
front
door
of
the
treasury
notes
were
presented
for
redemption
and
the
gold
was
quickly
carried
out
at
the
back
door
alarmed
at
the
vicious
circle
thus
created
he
urged
upon
congress
the
repeal
of
the
sherman
silver
purchase
act
for
this
he
was
roundly
condemned
by
many
of
his
own
followers
who
branded
his
conduct
as
treason
to
the
party
but
the
republicans
especially
from
the
east
came
to
his
rescue
and
in
swept
the
troublesome
sections
of
the
law
from
the
statute
book
the
anger
of
the
silver
faction
knew
no
bounds
and
the
leaders
made
ready
for
the
approaching
presidential
campaign
the
protective
tariff
and
taxation
fluctuation
in
tariff
policy
as
each
of
the
old
parties
was
divided
on
the
currency
question
it
is
not
surprising
that
there
was
some
confusion
in
their
ranks
over
the
tariff
like
the
silver
issue
the
tariff
tended
to
align
the
manufacturing
east
against
the
agricultural
west
and
south
rather
than
to
cut
directly
between
the
two
parties
still
the
republicans
on
the
whole
stood
firmly
by
the
rates
imposed
during
the
civil
war
if
we
except
the
reductions
of
which
were
soon
offset
by
increases
we
may
say
that
those
rates
were
substantially
unchanged
for
nearly
twenty
years
when  revision
was
brought
about
however
it
was
initiated
by
republican
leaders
seeing  huge
surplus
of
revenue
in
the
treasury
in
they
anticipated
popular
clamor
by
revising
the
tariff
on
the
theory
that
it
ought
to
be
reformed
by
its
friends
rather
than
by
its
enemies
on
the
other
hand
it
was
the
republicans
also
who
enacted
the
mckinley
tariff
bill
of
which
carried
protection
to
its
highest
point
up
to
that
time
the
democrats
on
their
part
were
not
all
confirmed
free
traders
or
even
advocates
of
tariff
for
revenue
only
in
cleveland  first
administration
they
did
attack
the
protective
system
in
the
house
where
they
had  majority
and
in
this
they
were
vigorously
supported
by
the
president
the
assault
however
proved
to
be  futile
gesture
for
it
was
blocked
by
the
republicans
in
the
senate
when
after
the
sweeping
victory
of
the
democrats
in
the
house
again
attempted
to
bring
down
the
tariff
by
the
wilson
bill
of
they
were
checkmated
by
their
own
party
colleagues
in
the
upper
chamber
in
the
end
they
were
driven
into  compromise
that
looked
more
like  mckinley
than  calhoun
tariff
the
republicans
taunted
them
with
being
babes
in
the
woods
president
cleveland
was
so
dissatisfied
with
the
bill
that
he
refused
to
sign
it
allowing
it
to
become  law
on
the
lapse
of
ten
days
without
his
approval
the
income
tax
of
the
advocates
of
tariff
reduction
usually
associated
with
their
proposal  tax
on
incomes
the
argument
which
they
advanced
in
support
of
their
program
was
simple
most
of
the
industries
they
said
are
in
the
east
and
the
protective
tariff
which
taxes
consumers
for
the
benefit
of
manufacturers
is
in
effect  tribute
laid
upon
the
rest
of
the
country
as
an
offset
they
offered  tax
on
large
incomes
this
owing
to
the
heavy
concentration
of
rich
people
in
the
east
would
fall
mainly
upon
the
beneficiaries
of
protection
we
propose
said
one
of
them
to
place  part
of
the
burden
upon
the
accumulated
wealth
of
the
country
instead
of
placing
it
all
upon
the
consumption
of
the
people
in
this
spirit
the
sponsors
of
the
wilson
tariff
bill
laid  tax
upon
all
incomes
of  year
or
more
in
taking
this
step
the
democrats
encountered
opposition
in
their
own
party
senator
hill
of
new
york
turned
fiercely
upon
them
exclaiming
the
professors
with
their
books
the
socialists
with
their
schemes
the
anarchists
with
their
bombs
are
all
instructing
the
people
in
the
principles
of
taxation
even
the
eastern
republicans
were
hardly
as
savage
in
their
denunciation
of
the
tax
but
all
this
labor
was
wasted
the
next
year
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
declared
the
income
tax
to
be  direct
tax
and
therefore
null
and
void
because
it
was
laid
on
incomes
wherever
found
and
not
apportioned
among
the
states
according
to
population
the
fact
that
four
of
the
nine
judges
dissented
from
this
decision
was
also
an
index
to
the
diversity
of
opinion
that
divided
both
parties
the
railways
and
trusts
the
grangers
and
state
regulation
the
same
uncertainty
about
the
railways
and
trusts
pervaded
the
ranks
of
the
republicans
and
democrats
as
to
the
railways
the
first
firm
and
consistent
demand
for
their
regulation
came
from
the
west
there
the
farmers
in
the
early
seventies
having
got
control
in
state
legislatures
particularly
in
iowa
wisconsin
and
illinois
enacted
drastic
laws
prescribing
the
maximum
charges
which
companies
could
make
for
carrying
freight
and
passengers
the
application
of
these
measures
however
was
limited
because
the
state
could
not
fix
the
rates
for
transporting
goods
and
passengers
beyond
its
own
borders
the
power
of
regulating
interstate
commerce
under
the
constitution
belonged
to
congress
the
interstate
commerce
act
of
within  few
years
the
movement
which
had
been
so
effective
in
western
legislatures
appeared
at
washington
in
the
form
of
demands
for
the
federal
regulation
of
interstate
rates
in
the
pressure
became
so
strong
that
congress
created
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
forbade
many
abuses
on
the
part
of
railways
such
as
discriminating
in
charges
between
one
shipper
and
another
and
granting
secret
rebates
to
favored
persons
this
law
was  significant
beginning
but
it
left
the
main
question
of
rate
fixing
untouched
much
to
the
discontent
of
farmers
and
shippers
the
sherman
anti
trust
law
of
as
in
the
case
of
the
railways
attacks
upon
the
trusts
were
first
made
in
state
legislatures
where
it
became
the
fashion
to
provide
severe
penalties
for
those
who
formed
monopolies
and
conspired
to
enhance
prices
republicans
and
democrats
united
in
the
promotion
of
measures
of
this
kind
as
in
the
case
of
the
railways
also
the
movement
to
curb
the
trusts
soon
had
spokesmen
at
washington
though
blaine
had
declared
that
trusts
were
largely  private
affair
with
which
neither
the
president
nor
any
private
citizen
had
any
particular
right
to
interfere
it
was  republican
congress
that
enacted
in
the
first
measure
the
sherman
anti
trust
law
directed
against
great
combinations
in
business
this
act
declared
illegal
every
contract
combination
in
the
form
of
trust
or
otherwise
or
conspiracy
in
restraint
of
trade
and
commerce
among
the
several
states
or
with
foreign
nations
the
futility
of
the
anti
trust
law
whether
the
sherman
law
was
directed
against
all
combinations
or
merely
those
which
placed
an
unreasonable
restraint
on
trade
and
competition
was
not
apparent
senator
platt
of
connecticut  careful
statesman
of
the
old
school
averred
the
questions
of
whether
the
bill
would
be
operative
of
how
it
would
operate
or
whether
it
was
within
the
power
of
congress
to
enact
it
have
been
whistled
down
the
wind
in
this
senate
as
idle
talk
and
the
whole
effort
has
been
to
get
some
bill
headed  bill
to
punish
trusts
with
which
to
go
to
the
country
whatever
its
purpose
its
effect
upon
existing
trusts
and
upon
the
formation
of
new
combinations
was
negligible
it
was
practically
unenforced
by
president
harrison
and
president
cleveland
in
spite
of
the
constant
demand
for
harsh
action
against
monopolies
it
was
patent
that
neither
the
republicans
nor
the
democrats
were
prepared
for  war
on
the
trusts
to
the
bitter
end
the
minor
parties
and
unrest
the
demands
of
dissenting
parties
from
the
election
of
when
horace
greeley
made
his
ill
fated
excursion
into
politics
onward
there
appeared
in
each
presidential
campaign
one
and
sometimes
two
or
more
parties
stressing
issues
that
appealed
mainly
to
wage
earners
and
farmers
whether
they
chose
to
call
themselves
labor
reformers
greenbackers
or
anti
monopolists
their
slogans
and
their
platforms
all
pointed
in
one
direction
even
the
prohibitionists
who
in
started
on
their
career
with  single
issue
the
abolition
of
the
liquor
traffic
found
themselves
making
declarations
of
faith
on
other
matters
and
hopelessly
split
over
the
money
question

placing

of

on

and
producers
criticism
of
the
old
parties
to
this
long
program
of
measures
the
reformers
added
harsh
and
acrid
criticism
of
the
old
parties
and
sometimes
it
must
be
said
of
established
institutions
of
government
we
denounce
exclaimed
the
labor
party
in
the
democratic
and
republican
parties
as
hopelessly
and
shamelessly
corrupt
and
by
reason
of
their
affiliation
with
monopolies
equally
unworthy
of
the
suffrages
of
those
who
do
not
live
upon
public
plunder
the
united
states
senate
insisted
the
greenbackers
is  body
composed
largely
of
aristocratic
millionaires
who
according
to
their
own
party
papers
generally
purchased
their
elections
in
order
to
protect
the
great
monopolies
which
they
represent
indeed
if
their
platforms
are
to
be
accepted
at
face
value
the
greenbackers
believed
that
the
entire
government
had
passed
out
of
the
hands
of
the
people
the
grangers
this
unsparing
not
to
say
revolutionary
criticism
of
american
political
life
appealed
it
seems
mainly
to
farmers
in
the
middle
west
always
active
in
politics
they
had
before
the
civil
war
cast
their
lot
as  rule
with
one
or
the
other
of
the
leading
parties
in
however
there
grew
up
among
them
an
association
known
as
the
patrons
of
husbandry
which
was
destined
to
play  large
role
in
the
partisan
contests
of
the
succeeding
decades
this
society
which
organized
local
lodges
or
granges
on
principles
of
secrecy
and
fraternity
was
originally
designed
to
promote
in  general
way
the
interests
of
the
farmers
its
political
bearings
were
apparently
not
grasped
at
first
by
its
promoters
yet
appealing
as
it
did
to
the
most
active
and
independent
spirits
among
the
farmers
and
gathering
to
itself
the
strength
that
always
comes
from
organization
it
soon
found
itself
in
the
hands
of
leaders
more
or
less
involved
in
politics
where  few
votes
are
marshaled
together
in  democracy
there
is
power
the
greenback
party
the
first
extensive
activity
of
the
grangers
was
connected
with
the
attack
on
the
railways
in
the
middle
west
which
forced
several
state
legislatures
to
reduce
freight
and
passenger
rates
by
law
at
the
same
time
some
leaders
in
the
movement
no
doubt
emboldened
by
this
success
launched
in  new
political
party
popularly
known
as
the
greenbackers
favoring  continued
re
issue
of
the
legal
tenders
the
beginnings
were
disappointing
but
two
years
later
in
the
congressional
elections
the
greenbackers
swept
whole
sections
of
the
country
their
candidates
polled
more
than  million
votes
and
fourteen
of
them
were
returned
to
the
house
of
representatives
to
all
outward
signs  new
and
formidable
party
had
entered
the
lists
the
sanguine
hopes
of
the
leaders
proved
to
be
illusory
the
quiet
operations
of
the
resumption
act
the
following
year  revival
of
industry
from  severe
panic
which
had
set
in
during
the
silver
purchase
act
and
the
re
issue
of
greenbacks
cut
away
some
of
the
grounds
of
agitation
there
was
also  diversion
of
forces
to
the
silver
faction
which
had  substantial
support
in
the
silver
mine
owners
of
the
west
at
all
events
the
greenback
vote
fell
to
about
in
the
election
of  still
greater
drop
came
four
years
later
and
the
party
gave
up
the
ghost
its
sponsors
returning
to
their
former
allegiance
or
sulking
in
their
tents
the
rise
of
the
populist
party
those
leaders
of
the
old
parties
who
now
looked
for  happy
future
unvexed
by
new
factions
were
doomed
to
disappointment
the
funeral
of
the
greenback
party
was
hardly
over
before
there
arose
two
other
political
specters
in
the
agrarian
sections
the
national
farmers
alliance
and
industrial
union
particularly
strong
in
the
south
and

in

two
orders

over
three
million
members
as

the
case

years
before
the

an
easy
way
into
politics

held  convention

for
president
and
adopted
the
name
of

which
they
were
known
as
populists

nearly
all
conservative

it

widely

firmly
held
it
was
they
who
picked
up
the
gauge
thrown
down
by

of

also
battled
against

defection
in

ranks
when

all
the

with

false

gather
at

shore
to
lure
the
ship
of

yet
it
is
due
to
historic
truth
to
state
that
mckinley
whom
the
republicans
nominated
had
voted
in
congress
for
the
free
coinage
of
silver
was
widely
known
as  bimetallist
and
was
only
with
difficulty
persuaded
to
accept
the
unequivocal
indorsement
of
the
gold
standard
which
was
pressed
upon
him
by
his
counselors
having
accepted
it
however
he
proved
to
be  valiant
champion
though
his
major
interest
was
undoubtedly
in
the
protective
tariff
to
him
nothing
was
more
reprehensible
than
attempts

the

masses
section

labor
against

the

interest

such
was
the
language
of
his
acceptance
speech
the
whole
program
of
populism
he
now
viewed
as  sudden
dangerous
and
revolutionary
assault
upon
law
and
order
the
democratic
convention
at
chicago
never
save
at
the
great
disruption
on
the
eve
of

the

the
platform
on
which
mr
bryan
stood
unlike

manifestoes
was
explicit
in
its
language
and
its
appeal
it
denounced
the
practice
of
allowing
national
banks
to
issue
notes
intended
to
circulate
as

on
the
ground
that
it
was
in

of

it
recurred
to
the
practice
abandoned
in

tax
came
next
on
the
program
the
platform
alleged
that
the
law
of
passed
by  democratic
congress
was
in
strict
pursuance
of
the
uniform
decisions
of
the
supreme
court
for
nearly  hundred

then
hinted
that
the
decision
annulling
the
law
might
be
reversed
by

body
as
it
may
hereafter
be
constituted
the
appeal
to
labor
voiced
by
mr
bryan
in

in

referring
to
the
recent
pullman
strike
the
passions
of
which
had
not
yet
died
away
the
platform
denounced
arbitrary
interference
by
federal
authorities
in
local
affairs
as  violation
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and  crime
against
free
institutions  special
objection
was
lodged
against

by
injunction
as  new
and
highly
dangerous
form
of
oppression
by
which
federal
judges
in
contempt
of
the
laws
of

and
rights
of

become
at

the

advanced

having

the

the
heated
campaign
the
campaign
which
ensued
outrivaled
in
the
range
of
its
educational
activities
and
the
bitterness
of
its
tone
all
other
political
conflicts
in
american
history
not
excepting
the
fateful
struggle
of
immense
sums
of
money
were
contributed
to
the
funds
of
both
parties
railway
banking
and
other
corporations
gave
generously
to
the
republicans
the
silver
miners
less
lavishly
but
with
the
same
anxiety
supported
the
democrats
the
country
was
flooded
with
pamphlets
posters
and
handbills
every
public
forum
from
the
great
auditoriums
of
the
cities
to
the
red
schoolhouses
on
the
countryside
was
occupied
by
the
opposing
forces
mr
bryan
took
the
stump
himself
visiting
all
parts
of
the
country
in
special
trains
and
addressing
literally
millions
of
people
in
the
open
air
mr
mckinley
chose
the
older
and
more
formal
plan
he
received
delegations
at
his
home
in
canton
and
discussed
the
issues
of
the
campaign
from
his
front
porch
leaving
to
an
army
of
well
organized
orators
the
task
of
reaching
the
people
in
their
home
towns
parades
processions
and
monster
demonstrations
filled
the
land
with
politics
whole
states
were
polled
in
advance
by
the
republicans
and
the
doubtful
voters
personally
visited
by
men
equipped
with
arguments
and
literature
manufacturers
frightened
at
the
possibility
of
disordered
public
credit
announced
that
they
would
close
their
doors
if
the
democrats
won
the
election
men
were
dismissed
from
public
and
private
places
on
account
of
their
political
views
one
eminent
college
president
being
forced
out
for
advocating
free
silver
the
language
employed
by
impassioned
and
embittered
speakers
on
both
sides
roused
the
public
to  state
of
frenzy
once
more
showing
the
lengths
to
which
men
could
go
in
personal
and
political
abuse
the
republican
victory
the
verdict
of
the
nation
was
decisive
mckinley
received
of
the
electoral
votes
and
popular
votes
as
against
bryan  the
congressional
elections
were
equally
positive
although
on
account
of
the
composition
of
the
senate
the
hold
over
democrats
and
populists
still
enjoyed  power
out
of
proportion
to
their
strength
as
measured
at
the
polls
even
as
it
was
the
republicans
got
full
control
of
both
houses  dominion
of
the
entire
government
which
they
were
to
hold
for
fourteen
years
until
the
second
half
of
mr
taft  administration
when
they
lost
possession
of
the
house
of
representatives
the
yoke
of
indecision
was
broken
the
party
of
sound
finance
and
protective
tariffs
set
out
upon
its
lease
of
power
with
untroubled
assurance
republican
measures
and
results
the
gold
standard
and
the
tariff
yet
strange
as
it
may
seem
the
republicans
did
not
at
once
enact
legislation
making
the
gold
dollar
the
standard
for
the
national
currency
not
until
did
they
take
that
positive
step
in
his
first
inaugural
president
mckinley
as
if
still
uncertain
in
his
own
mind
or
fearing  revival
of
the
contest
just
closed
placed
the
tariff
not
the
money
question
in
the
forefront
the
people
have
decided
he
said
that
such
legislation
should
be
had
as
will
give
ample
protection
and
encouragement
to
the
industries
and
development
of
our
country
protection
for
american
industries
therefore
he
urged
is
the
task
before
congress
with
adequate
revenue
secured
but
not
until
then
we
can
enter
upon
changes
in
our
fiscal
laws
as
the
republicans
had
only
forty
six
of
the
ninety
senators
and
at
least
four
of
them
were
known
advocates
of
free
silver
the
discretion
exercised
by
the
president
in
selecting
the
tariff
for
congressional
debate
was
the
better
part
of
valor
congress
gave
heed
to
the
warning
under
the
direction
of
nelson  dingley
whose
name
was
given
to
the
bill  tariff
measure
levying
the
highest
rates
yet
laid
in
the
history
of
american
imposts
was
prepared
and
driven
through
the
house
of
representatives
the
opposition
encountered
in
the
senate
especially
from
the
west
was
overcome
by
concessions
in
favor
of
that
section
but
the
duties
on
sugar
tin
steel
lumber
hemp
and
in
fact
all
of
the
essential
commodities
handled
by
combinations
and
trusts
were

raised

the
years
that
followed

were
whatever

the
most

the

had
witnessed
for

commerce
spread
more

than
ever

coincident
with
this
progress
was
the
organization
of
the
greatest

the

had
yet
seen

in
the

the

with  capital
of

took

of

and
the

was
incorporated
under

shortly
afterward
at  year
later
the

policy
of
issuing
to
the
stockholders
no
public
statement
of
its

or

condition
before
another
twelvemonth
had
elapsed
all
previous
corporate

was
reduced
to
small
proportions
by
the

of
the

steel
corporation
with  capital
of
more
than  billion
dollars
an
enterprise
set
in
motion
by
the
famous
morgan
banking
house
of
new

in
nearly
all
these
gigantic
undertakings
the
same
great
leaders
in
finance
were
more
or
less
intimately
associated
to
use
the
language
of
an
eminent
authority
they
are
all
allied
and
intertwined
by
their
various
mutual
interests
for
instance
the
pennsylvania
railroad
interests
are
on
the
one
hand
allied
with
the
vanderbilts
and
on
the
other
with
the
rockefellers
the
vanderbilts
are
closely
allied
with
the
morgan
group
viewed
as  whole
we
find
the
dominating
influences
in
the
trusts
to
be
made
up
of  network
of
large
and
small
capitalists
many
allied
to
one
another
by
ties
of
more
or
less
importance
but
all
being
appendages
to
or
parts
of
the
greater
groups
which
are
themselves
dependent
on
and
allied
with
the
two
mammoth

rockefeller
and
morgan
groups
these
two
mammoth
groups
jointly
constitute
the
heart
of
the
business
and
commercial
life
of
the
nation
such
was
the
picture
of
triumphant

enterprise
drawn
by  financier
within  few
years
after
the
memorable
campaign
of
america
had

america  world
power
it
has
now
become  fashion
sanctioned
by
wide
usage
and
by
eminent
historians
to
speak
of
america
triumphant
over
spain
and
possessed
of
new
colonies
as
entering
the
twentieth
century
in
the
role
of  world
power
for
the
first
time
perhaps
at
this
late
day
it
is
useless
to
protest
against
the
currency
of
the
idea
nevertheless
the
truth
is
that
from
the
fateful
moment
in
march
when
edmund
burke
unfolded
to
his
colleagues
in
the
british
parliament
the
resources
of
an
invincible
america
down
to
the
settlement
at
versailles
in
closing
the
drama
of
the
world
war
this
nation
has
been  world
power
influencing
by
its
example
by
its
institutions
by
its
wealth
trade
and
arms
the
course
of
international
affairs
and
it
should
be
said
also
that
neither
in
the
field
of
commercial
enterprise
nor
in
that
of
diplomacy
has
it
been
wanting
in
spirit
or
ingenuity
when
john
hay
secretary
of
state
heard
that
an
american
citizen
perdicaris
had
been
seized
by
raisuli  moroccan
bandit
in
he
wired
his
brusque
message
we
want
perdicaris
alive
or
raisuli
dead
this
was
but
an
echo
of
commodore
decatur  equally
characteristic
answer
not  minute
given
nearly  hundred
years
before
to
the
pirates
of
algiers
begging
for
time
to
consider
whether
they
would
cease
preying
upon
american
merchantmen
was
it
not
as
early
as
that
the
american
commissioner
caleb
cushing
taking
advantage
of
the
british
opium
war
on
china
negotiated
with
the
celestial
empire  successful
commercial
treaty
did
he
not
then
exultantly
exclaim
the
laws
of
the
union
follow
its
citizens
and
its
banner
protects
them
even
within
the
domain
of
the
chinese
empire
was
it
not
almost
half  century
before
the
battle
of
manila
bay
in
that
commodore
perry
with
an
adequate
naval
force
gently
coerced
japan
into
friendship
with
us
leading
all
the
nations
of
the
earth
in
the
opening
of
that
empire
to
the
trade
of
the
occident
nor
is
it
inappropriate
in
this
connection
to
recall
the
fact
that
the
monroe
doctrine
celebrates
in
its
hundredth
anniversary
american
foreign
relations
french
intrigues
in
mexico
blocked
between
the
war
for
the
union
and
the
war
with
spain
the
department
of
state
had
many
an
occasion
to
present
the
rights
of
america
among
the
powers
of
the
world
only  little
while
after
the
civil
conflict
came
to  close
it
was
called
upon
to
deal
with  dangerous
situation
created
in
mexico
by
the
ambitions
of
napoleon
iii
during
the
administration
of
buchanan
mexico
had
fallen
into
disorder
through
the
strife
of
the
liberal
and
the
clerical
parties
the
president
asked
for
authority
to
use
american
troops
to
bring
to  peaceful
haven  wreck
upon
the
ocean
drifting
about
as
she
is
impelled
by
different
factions
our
own
domestic
crisis
then
intervened
observing
the
united
states
heavily
involved
in
its
own
problems
the
great
powers
england
france
and
spain
decided
in
the
autumn
of
to
take  hand
themselves
in
restoring
order
in
mexico
they
entered
into
an
agreement
to
enforce
the
claims
of
their
citizens
against
mexico
and
to
protect
their
subjects
residing
in
that
republic
they
invited
the
united
states
to
join
them
and
on
meeting  polite
refusal
they
prepared
for  combined
military
and
naval
demonstration
on
their
own
account
in
the
midst
of
this
action
england
and
spain
discovering
the
sinister
purposes
of
napoleon
withdrew
their
troops
and
left
the
field
to
him
the
french
emperor
it
was
well
known
looked
with
jealousy
upon
the
growth
of
the
united
states
and
dreamed
of
establishing
in
the
western
hemisphere
an
imperial
power
to
offset
the
american
republic
intervention
to
collect
debts
was
only  cloak
for
his
deeper
designs
throwing
off
that
guise
in
due
time
he
made
the
archduke
maximilian  brother
of
the
ruler
of
austria
emperor
in
mexico
and
surrounded
his
throne
by
french
soldiers
in
spite
of
all
protests
this
insolent
attack
upon
the
mexican
republic
deeply
resented
in
the
united
states
was
allowed
to
drift
in
its
course
until
at
that
juncture
general
sheridan
was
dispatched
to
the
mexican
border
with  large
armed
force
general
grant
urged
the
use
of
the
american
army
to
expel
the
french
from
this
continent
the
secretary
of
state
seward
counseled
negotiation
first
and
applying
the
monroe
doctrine
was
able
to
prevail
upon
napoleon
iii
to
withdraw
his
troops
without
the
support
of
french
arms
the
sham
empire
in
mexico
collapsed
like  house
of
cards
and
the
unhappy
maximilian
the
victim
of
french
ambition
and
intrigue
met
his
death
at
the
hands
of  mexican
firing
squad
alaska
purchased
the
mexican
affair
had
not
been
brought
to  close
before
the
department
of
state
was
busy
with
negotiations
which
resulted
in
the
purchase
of
alaska
from
russia
the
treaty
of
cession
signed
on
march
added
to
the
united
states  domain
of
nearly
six
hundred
thousand
square
miles  territory
larger
than
texas
and
nearly
three
fourths
the
size
of
the
louisiana
purchase
though
it
was  distant
colony
separated
from
our
continental
domain
by  thousand
miles
of
water
no
question
of
imperialism
or
colonization
foreign
to
american
doctrines
seems
to
have
been
raised
at
the
time
the
treaty
was
ratified
promptly
by
the
senate
the
purchase
price
was
voted
by
the
house
of
representatives
after
the
display
of
some
resentment
against  system
that
compelled
it
to
appropriate
money
to
fulfill
an
obligation
which
it
had
no
part
in
making
seward
who
formulated
the
treaty
rejoiced
as
he
afterwards
said
that
he
had
kept
alaska
out
of
the
hands
of
england
american
interest
in
the
caribbean
having
achieved
this
diplomatic
triumph
seward
turned
to
the
increase
of
american
power
in
another
direction
he
negotiated
with
denmark  treaty
providing
for
the
purchase
of
the
islands
of
st
john
and
st
thomas
in
the
west
indies
strategic
points
in
the
caribbean
for
sea
power
this
project
long
afterward
brought
to
fruition
by
other
men
was
defeated
on
this
occasion
by
the
refusal
of
the
senate
to
ratify
the
treaty
evidently
it
was
not
yet
prepared
to
exercise
colonial
dominion
over
other
races
undaunted
by
the
misadventure
in
caribbean
policies
president

warmly
advocated
the
acquisition
of
santo

this
little
republic
had
long
been
in  state
of
general
disorder
in  treaty
of
annexation
was
concluded
with
its
president
the
document
grant
transmitted
to
the
senate
with
his
cordial
approval
only
to
have
it
rejected
not
at
all
changed
in
his
opinion
by
the
outcome
of
his
effort
he
continued
to
urge
the
subject
of
annexation
even
in
his
last
message
to
congress
he
referred
to
it
saying
that
time
had
only
proved
the
wisdom
of
his
early
course
the
addition
of
santo
domingo
to
the
american
sphere
of
protection
was
the
work
of  later
generation
the
state
department
temporarily
checked
had
to
bide
its
time
the
alabama
claims
arbitrated
indeed
it
had
in
hand  far
more
serious
matter  vexing
issue
that
grew
out
of
civil
war
diplomacy
the
british
government
as
already
pointed
out
in
other
connections
had
permitted
confederate
cruisers
including

ports

this
action
denounced
at
the
time
by
our
government
as  grave
breach
of

as

as  grievous
injury

britain

her
foreign

denied

adding
somewhat
curtly
that
he
wished
to
say
once
for
all
that
her
majesty  government
disclaimed
any
responsibility
for

and
hoped
that
they
had
made
their
position
perfectly
clear

of

though
closed
was
barred

his
secretary
of
state
renewed
the
demand
finally
he
secured
from
the
british
government
in
the
treaty
of
washington
providing
for
the
arbitration
not
merely
of
the
alabama
and
other
claims
but
also
all
points
of
serious
controversy
between
the
two
countries
the
tribunal
of
arbitration
thus
authorized
sat
at
geneva
in
switzerland
and
after  long
and
careful
review
of
the
arguments
on
both
sides
awarded
to
the
united
states
the
lump
sum
of
to
be
distributed
among
the
american
claimants
the
damages
thus
allowed
were
large
unquestionably
larger
than
strict
justice
required
and
it
is
not
surprising
that
the
decision
excited
much
adverse
comment
in
england
nevertheless
the
prompt
payment
by
the
british
government
swept
away
at
once  great
cloud
of
ill
feeling
in
america
moreover
the
spectacle
of
two
powerful
nations
choosing
the
way
of
peaceful
arbitration
to
settle
an
angry
dispute
seemed  happy
if
illusory
omen
of  modern
method
for
avoiding
the
arbitrament
of
war
samoa
if
the
senate
had
its
doubts
at
first
about
the
wisdom
of
acquiring
strategic
points
for
naval
power
in
distant
seas
the
same
could
not
be
said
of
the
state

officers

of
the
samoan
islands
far
below
the

in

southern

agreement
providing
among
other
things
for

use
of
the
harbor
of
pago
pago
as  naval
base
was
six
years
later
changed
into  formal
treaty
ratified
by
the
senate
such
enterprise
could
not
escape
the
vigilant
eyes
of
england
and
germany
both
mindful
of
the
course
of
the
sea
power
in
history
the
german
emperor
seizing
as  pretext  quarrel
between
his
consul
in
the
islands
and  native
king
laid
claim
to
an
interest
in
the
samoan
group
england
aware
of
the
dangers
arising
from
german
outposts
in
the
southern
seas
so
near
to
australia
was
not
content
to
stand
aside
so
it
happened
that
all
three
countries
sent
battleships
to
the
samoan
waters
threatening  crisis
that
was
fortunately
averted
by
friendly
settlement
if
as
is
alleged
germany
entertained  notion
of
challenging
american
sea
power
then
and
there
the
presence
of
british
ships
must
have
dispelled
that
dream
the
result
of
the
affair
was  tripartite
agreement
by
which
the
three
powers
in
undertook  protectorate
over
the
islands
but
joint
control
proved
unsatisfactory
there
was
constant
friction
between
the
germans
and
the
english
the
spheres
of
authority
being
vague
and
open
to
dispute
the
plan
had
to
be
abandoned
at
the
end
of
ten
years
england
withdrew
altogether
leaving
to
germany
all
the
islands
except
tutuila
which
was
ceded
outright
to
the
united
states
thus
one
of
the
finest
harbors
in
the
pacific
to
the
intense
delight
of
the
american
navy
passed
permanently
under
american
dominion
another
triumph
in
diplomacy
was
set
down
to
the
credit
of
the
state
department
cleveland
and
the
venezuela
affair
in
the
relations
with
south
america
as
well
as
in
those
with
the
distant
pacific
the
diplomacy
of
the
government
at
washington
was
put
to
the
test
for
some
time
it
had
been
watching  dispute
between
england
and
venezuela
over
the
western
boundary
of
british
guiana
and
on
an
appeal
from
venezuela
it
had
taken  lively
interest
in
the
contest
in
president
cleveland
saw
that
great
britain
would
yield
none
of
her
claims
after
hearing
the
arguments
of
venezuela
his
secretary
of
state
richard  olney
in  note
none
too
conciliatory
asked
the
british
government
whether
it
was
willing
to
arbitrate
the
points
in
controversy
this
inquiry
he
accompanied
by  warning
to
the
effect
that
the
united
states
could
not
permit
any
european
power
to
contest
its
mastery
in
this
hemisphere
the
united
states
said
the
secretary
is
practically
sovereign
on
this
continent
and
its
fiat
is
law
upon
the
subjects
to
which
it
confines
its
interposition
its
infinite
resources
combined
with
its
isolated
position
render
it
master
of
the
situation
and
practically
invulnerable
against
any
or
all
other
powers
the
reply
evoked
from
the
british
government
by
this
strong
statement
was
firm
and
clear
the
monroe
doctrine
it
said
even
if
not
so
widely
stretched
by
interpretation
was
not
binding
in
international
law
the
dispute
with
venezuela
was  matter
of
interest
merely
to
the
parties
involved
and
arbitration
of
the
question
was
impossible
this
response
called
forth
president
cleveland  startling
message
of
he
asked
congress
to
create  commission
authorized
to
ascertain
by
researches
the
true
boundary
between
venezuela
and
british
guiana
he
added
that
it
would
be
the
duty
of
this
country
to
resist
by
every
means
in
its
power
as  willful
aggression
upon
its
rights
and
interests
the
appropriation
by
great
britain
of
any
lands
or
the
exercise
of
governmental
jurisdiction
over
any
territory
which
after
investigation
we
have
determined
of
right
belongs
to
venezuela
the
serious
character
of
this
statement
he
thoroughly
understood
he
declared
that
he
was
conscious
of
his
responsibilities
intimating
that
war
much
as
it
was
to
be
deplored
was
not
comparable
to  supine
submission
to
wrong
and
injustice
and
the
consequent
loss
of
national
self
respect
and
honor
illustration
grover
cleveland
the
note
of
defiance
which
ran
through
this
message
greeted
by
shrill
cries
of
enthusiasm
in
many
circles
was
viewed
in
other
quarters
as  portent
of
war
responsible
newspapers
in
both
countries
spoke
of
an
armed
settlement
of
the
dispute

inevitable
congress
created
the
commission

appropriated
money
for
the
investigation  body
of
learned
men
was
appointed
to
determine
the
merits
of
the
conflicting

the
british
government
deaf
to
the
clamor
of
the
bellicose
section
of
the
london
press
deplored
the
incident
courteously
replied
in
the
affirmative
to  request
for
assistance
in
the
search
for
evidence
and
finally
agreed
to
the
proposition
that
the
issue
be
submitted
to
arbitration
the
outcome
of
this
somewhat
perilous
dispute
contributed
not  little
to
cleveland  reputation
as  sterling
representative
of
the
true
american
spirit
this
was
not
diminished
when
the
tribunal
of
arbitration
found
that
great
britain
was
on
the
whole
right
in
her
territorial
claims
against
venezuela
the
annexation
of
hawaii
while
engaged
in
the
dangerous
venezuela
controversy
president
cleveland
was
compelled
by  strange
turn
in
events
to
consider
the
annexation
of
the
hawaiian
islands
in
the
mid
pacific
for
more
than
half  century
american
missionaries
had
been
active
in
converting
the
natives
to
the
christian
faith
and
enterprising
american
business
men
had
been
developing
the
fertile
sugar
plantations
both
the
department
of
state
and
the
navy
department
were
fully
conscious
of
the
strategic
relation
of
the
islands
to
the
growth
of
sea
power
and
watched
with
anxiety
any
developments
likely
to
bring
them
under
some
other
dominion
the
country
at
large
was
indifferent
however
until
when  revolution
headed
by
americans
broke
out
ending
in
the
overthrow
of
the
native
government
the
abolition
of
the
primitive
monarchy
and
the
retirement
of
queen
liliuokalani
to
private
life
this
crisis  repetition
of
the
texas
affair
in  small
theater
was
immediately
followed
by  demand
from
the
new
hawaiian
government
for
annexation
to
the
united
states
president
harrison
looked
with
favor
on
the
proposal
negotiated
the
treaty
of
annexation
and
laid
it
before
the
senate
for
approval
there
it
still
rested
when
his
term
of
office
was
brought
to  close
harrison  successor
cleveland
it
was
well
known
had
doubts
about
the
propriety
of
american
action
in
hawaii
for
the
purpose
of
making
an
inquiry
into
the
matter
he
sent  special
commissioner
to
the
islands
on
the
basis
of
the
report
of
his
agent
cleveland
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
revolution
in
the
island
kingdom
had
been
accomplished
by
the
improper
use
of
the
armed
forces
of
the
united
states
and
that
the
wrong
should
be
righted
by  restoration
of
the
queen
to
her
throne
such
being
his
matured
conviction
though
the
facts
upon
which
he
rested
it
were
warmly
controverted
he
could
do
nothing
but
withdraw
the
treaty
from
the
senate
and
close
the
incident
to
the
republicans
this
sharp
and
cavalier
disposal
of
their
plans
carried
out
in  way
that
impugned
the
motives
of  republican
president
was
nothing
less
than  betrayal
of
american
interests
in
their
platform
of
they
made
clear
their
position
our
foreign
policy
should
be
at
all
times
firm
vigorous
and
dignified
and
all
our
interests
in
the
western
hemisphere
carefully
watched
and
guarded
the
hawaiian
islands
should
be
controlled
by
the
united
states
and
no
foreign
power
should
be
permitted
to
interfere
with
them
there
was
no
mistaking
this
view
of
the
issue
as
the
vote
in
the
election
gave
popular
sanction
to
republican
policies
congress
by  joint
resolution
passed
on
july
annexed
the

of

last
remnants

for  century
the
department

had
kept
an
anxious
eye
upon
this
base
of
power
knowing
full
well
that
both
france

already
well
established
in

their
attention

had
united
in
proposing
to
the
united
states  tripartite
treaty
guaranteeing
spain

none
too
certain
ownership
this
proposal
squarely
rejected
furnished
the
occasion
for  statement
of
american
policy
which
stood
the
test
of
all
the
years
that
followed
namely
that
the
affair
was
one
between
spain

the

long
contest

an
opportunity
to
announce
their
purposes
publicly
was
afforded
in
by  controversy

the

of
an
american
ship
by

authorities
on
that
occasion
three
american
ministers
abroad

held  conference

issued
the
celebrated
ostend

they
united

by
her
geographical
position
formed  part
of
the

that
possession
by  foreign

is

of
american
opinion
few
gave
heed
to
the
grave
breach
of
diplomatic
courtesy
committed
by
breaking
open
private
correspondence
the
spanish
government
was
compelled
to
recall
de
lome
thus
officially
condemning
his
conduct
at
this
point  far
more
serious
crisis
put
the
pacific
relations
of
the
two
negotiating
countries
in
dire
peril
on
february
the
battleship
maine
riding
in
the
harbor
of
havana
was
blown
up
and
sunk
carrying
to
death
two
officers
and
two
hundred
and
fifty
eight
members
of
the
crew
this
tragedy
ascribed
by
the
american
public
to
the
malevolence
of
spanish
officials
profoundly
stirred
an
already
furious
nation
when
on
march  commission
of
inquiry
reported
that
the
ill
fated
ship
had
been
blown
up
by  submarine
mine
which
had
in
turn
set
off
some
of
the
ship  magazines
the
worst
suspicions
seemed
confirmed
if
any
one
was
inclined
to
be
indifferent
to
the
cuban
war
for
independence
he
was
now
met
by
the
vehement
cry
remember
the
maine
spanish
concessions
still
the
state
department
under
mckinley  steady
hand
pursued
the
path
of
negotiation
spain
proving
more
pliable
and
more
ready
with
promises
of
reform
in
the
island
early
in
april
however
there
came  decided
change
in
the
tenor
of
american
diplomacy
on
the
th
mckinley
evidently
convinced
that
promises
did
not
mean
performances
instructed
our
minister
at
madrid
to
warn
the
spanish
government
that
as
no
effective
armistice
had
been
offered
to
the
cubans
he
would
lay
the
whole
matter
before
congress
this
decision
every
one
knew
from
the
temper
of
congress
meant
war  prospect
which
excited
all
the
european
powers
the
pope
took
an
active
interest
in
the
crisis
france
and
germany
foreseeing
from
long
experience
in
world
politics
an
increase
of
american
power
and
prestige
through
war
sought
to
prevent
it
spain
hopeless
and
conscious
of
her
weakness
at
last
dispatched
to
the
president  note
promising
to
suspend
hostilities
to
call  cuban
parliament
and
to
grant
all
the
autonomy
that
could
be
reasonably
asked
president
mckinley
calls
for
war
for
reasons
of
his
own
reasons
which
have
never
yet
been
fully
explained
mckinley
ignored
the
final
program
of
concessions
presented
by
spain
at
the
very
moment
when
his
patient
negotiations
seemed
to
bear
full
fruit
he
veered
sharply
from
his
course
and
launched
the
country
into
the
war
by
sending
to
congress
his
militant
message
of
april
without
making
public
the
last
note
he
had
received
from
spain
he
declared
that
he
was
brought
to
the
end
of
his
effort
and
the
cause
was
in
the
hands
of
congress
humanity
the
protection
of
american
citizens
and
property
the
injuries
to
american
commerce
and
business
the
inability
of
spain
to
bring
about
permanent
peace
in
the
island
these
were
the
grounds
for
action
that
induced
him
to
ask
for
authority
to
employ
military
and
naval
forces
in
establishing  stable
government
in
cuba
they
were
sufficient
for  public
already
straining
at
the
leash
the
resolution
of
congress
there
was
no
doubt
of
the
outcome
when
the
issue
was
withdrawn
from
diplomacy
and
placed
in
charge
of
congress
resolutions
were
soon
introduced
into
the
house
of
representatives
authorizing
the
president
to
employ
armed
force
in
securing
peace
and
order
in
the
island
and
establishing
by
the
free
action
of
the
people
thereof  stable
and
independent
government
of
their
own
to
the
form
and
spirit
of
this
proposal
the
democrats
and
populists
took
exception
in
the
senate
where
they
were
stronger
their
position
had
to
be
reckoned
with
by
the
narrow
republican
majority
as
the
resolution
finally
read
the
independence
of
cuba
was
recognized
spain
was
called
upon
to
relinquish
her
authority
and
withdraw
from
the
island
and
the
president
was
empowered
to
use
force
to
the
extent
necessary
to
carry
the
resolutions
into
effect
furthermore
the
united
states
disclaimed
any
disposition
or
intention
to
exercise
sovereignty
jurisdiction
or
control
over
said
island
except
for
the
pacification
thereof
final
action
was
taken
by
congress
on
april
and
approved
by
the
president
on
the
following
day

stern
facts
as
early
as

acting
through
the
french
ambassador  cambon
the
madrid
government
approached
president
mckinley
for  statement
of
the
terms
on
which
hostilities
could
be
brought
to  close
after
some
skirmishing

yielded
reluctantly
to

ultimatum

was
signed
stipulating
that

commissioners
of

two
countries
met
at
paris
to
bring
about
the
final
settlement
peace
negotiations
when
the
day
for
the
first
session
of
the
conference
arrived
the
government
at
washington
apparently
had
not
made
up
its
mind
on
the
final
disposition
of
the
philippines
perhaps
before
the
battle
of
manila
bay
not
ten
thousand
people
in
the
united
states
knew
or
cared
where
the
philippines
were
certainly
there
was
in
the
autumn
of
no
decided
opinion
as
to
what
should
be
done
with
the
fruits
of
dewey  victory
president
mckinley
doubtless
voiced
the
sentiment
of
the
people
when
he
stated
to
the
peace
commissioners
on
the
eve
of
their
departure
that
there
had
originally
been
no
thought
of
conquest
in
the
pacific
the
march
of
events
he
added
had
imposed
new
duties
on
the
country
incidental
to
our
tenure
in
the
philippines
he
said
is
the
commercial
opportunity
to
which
american
statesmanship
cannot
be
indifferent
it
is
just
to
use
every
legitimate
means
for
the
enlargement
of
american
trade
on
this
ground
he
directed
the
commissioners
to
accept
not
less
than
the
cession
of
the
island
of
luzon
the
chief
of
the
philippine
group
with
its
harbor
of
manila
it
was
not
until
the
latter
part
of
october
that
he
definitely
instructed
them
to
demand
the
entire
archipelago
on
the
theory
that
the
occupation
of
luzon
alone
could
not
be
justified
on
political
commercial
or
humanitarian
grounds
this
departure
from
the
letter
of
the
peace
protocol
was
bitterly
resented
by
the
spanish
agents
it
was
with
heaviness
of
heart
that
they
surrendered
the
last
sign
of
spain  ancient
dominion
in
the
far
pacific
the
final
terms
of
peace
the
treaty
of
peace
as
finally
agreed
upon
embraced
the
following
terms
the
independence
of
cuba
the
cession
of
porto
rico
guam
and
the
philippines
to
the
united
states
the
settlement
of
claims
filed
by
the
citizens
of
both
countries
the
payment
of
twenty
million
dollars
to
spain
by
the
united
states
for
the
philippines
and
the
determination
of
the
status
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
ceded
territories
by
congress
the
great
decision
had
been
made
its
issue
was
in
the
hands
of
the
senate
where
the
democrats
and
the
populists
held
the
balance
of
power
under
the
requirement
of
the
two
thirds
vote
for
ratification
the
contest
in
america
over
the
treaty
of
peace
the
publication
of
the
treaty
committing
the
united
states
to
the
administration
of
distant
colonies
directed
the
shifting
tides
of
public
opinion
into
two
distinct
channels
support
of
the
policy
and
opposition
to
it
the
trend
in
republican
leadership
long
in
the
direction
marked
out
by
the
treaty
now
came
into
the
open
perhaps  majority
of
the
men
highest
in
the
councils
of
that
party
had
undergone
the
change
of
heart
reflected
in
the
letters
of
john
hay
secretary
of
state
in
august
of
he
had
hinted
in  friendly
letter
to
andrew
carnegie
that
he
sympathized
with
the
latter  opposition
to
imperialism
but
he
had
added
quickly
the
only
question
in
my
mind
is
how
far
it
is
now
possible
for
us
to
withdraw
from
the
philippines
in
november
of
the
same
year
he
wrote
to
whitelaw
reid
one
of
the
peace
commissioners
at
paris
there
is  wild
and
frantic
attack
now
going
on
in
the
press
against
the
whole
philippine
transaction
andrew
carnegie
really
seems
to
be
off
his
head
but
all
this
confusion
of
tongues
will
go
its
way
the
country
will
applaud
the
resolution
that
has
been
reached
and
you
will
return
in
the
role
of
conquering
heroes
with
your
brows
bound
with
oak
senator
beveridge
of
indiana
and

platt
of
connecticut

the
verdict
of

as
the
proof
of
manifest
destiny
called
for
unquestioning
support
of
the
administration
in
its
final
step
every
expansion
of
our
territory
said
the
latter
has
been
in
accordance
with
the
irresistible
law
of
growth
we
could
no
more
resist
the
successive
expansions
by
which
we
have
grown
to
be
the
strongest
nation
on
earth
than  tree
can
resist
its
growth
the
history
of
territorial
expansion
is
the
history
of
our
nation  progress
and
glory
it
is  matter
to
be
proud
of
not
to
lament
we
should
rejoice
that
providence
has
given
us
the
opportunity
to
extend
our
influence
our
institutions
and
our
civilization
into
regions
hitherto
closed
to
us
rather
than
contrive
how
we
can
thwart
its
designs
this
doctrine
was
savagely
attacked
by
opponents
of
mckinley  policy

career
gave
weight
to

against

to
the
end
of
his
days
believed
that
the

into

was
fraught
with

danger
our

to

such  government
as
we

they
are

we
shall
give

than

to  free

the
most
stinging
of

in

the
germ
of

and
of
all

about

recalcitrant

and
brought

in

patriotism
required

it
was
said
in
one
quarter
the
country
desires
peace
and
the
senate
ought
not
to
delay
it
was
urged
in
another
finally
on
february
the
requisite
majority
of
two
thirds
was
mustered
many  senator
who
voted
for
the
treaty
however
sharing
the
misgivings
of
senator
hoar
as
to
the
dangers
of
imperialism
indeed
at
the
time
the
senators
passed  resolution
declaring
that
the
policy
to
be
adopted
in
the
philippines
was
still
an
open
question
leaving
to
the
future
in
this
way
the
possibility
of
retracing
their
steps
the
attitude
of
england
the
spanish
war
while
accomplishing
the
simple
objects
of
those
who
launched
the
nation
on
that
course
like
all
other
wars
produced
results
wholly
unforeseen
in
the
first
place
it
exercised  profound
influence
on
the
drift
of
opinion
among
european
powers
in
england
sympathy
with
the
united
states
was
from
the
first
positive
and
outspoken
the
state
of
feeling
here
wrote
mr
hay
then
ambassador
in
london
is
the
best  have
ever
known
from
every
quarter
the
evidences
of
it
come
to
me
the
royal
family
by
habit
and
tradition
are
most
careful
not
to
break
the
rules
of
strict
neutrality
but
even
among
them  find
nothing
but
hearty
kindness
and
so
far
as
is
consistent
with
propriety
sympathy
among
the
political
leaders
on
both
sides  find
not
only
sympathy
but  somewhat
eager
desire
that
the
other
fellows
shall
not
seem
more
friendly
joseph
chamberlain
the
distinguished
liberal
statesman
thinking
no
doubt
of
the
continental
situation
said
in  political
address
at
the
very
opening
of
the
war
that
the
next
duty
of
englishmen
is
to
establish
and
maintain
bonds
of
permanent
unity
with
our
kinsmen
across
the
atlantic  even
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
terrible
as
war
may
be
even
war
would
be
cheaply
purchased
if
in  great
and
noble
cause
the
stars
and
stripes
and
the
union
jack
should
wave
together
over
an
anglo
saxon
alliance
to
the
american
ambassador
he
added
significantly
that
he
did
not
care  hang
what
they
say
about
it
on
the
continent
which
was
another
way
of
expressing
the
hope
that
the
warning
to
germany
and
france
was
sufficient
this
friendly
english
opinion
so
useful
to
the
united
states
when  combination
of
powers
to
support
spain
was
more
than
possible
removed
all
fears
as
to
the
consequences
of
the
war
henry
adams
recalling
days
of
humiliation
in
london
during
the
civil
war
when
his
father
was
the
american
ambassador
coolly
remarked
that
it
was
the
sudden
appearance
of
germany
as
the
grizzly
terror
that
frightened
england
into
america  arms
but
the
net
result
in
keeping
the
field
free
for
an
easy
triumph
of
american
arms
was
none
the
less
appreciated
in
washington
where
despite
outward
calm
fears
of
european
complications
were
never
absent
american
policies
in
the
philippines
and
the
orient
the
filipino
revolt
against
american
rule
in
the
sphere
of
domestic
politics
as
well
as
in
the
field
of
foreign
relations
the
outcome
of
the
spanish
war
exercised  marked
influence
it
introduced
at
once
problems
of
colonial
administration
and
difficulties
in
adjusting
trade
relations
with
the
outlying
dominions
these
were
furthermore
complicated
in
the
very
beginning
by
the
outbreak
of
an
insurrection
against
american
sovereignty
in
the
philippines
the
leader
of
the
revolt
aguinaldo
had
been
invited
to
join
the
american
forces
in
overthrowing
spanish
dominion
and
he
had
assumed
apparently
without
warrant
that
independence
would
be
the
result
of
the
joint
operations
when
the
news
reached
him
that
the
american
flag
had
been
substituted
for
the
spanish
flag
his
resentment
was
keen
in
february
there
occurred  slight
collision
between
his
men
and
some
american
soldiers
the
conflict
thus
begun
was
followed
by
serious
fighting
which
finally
dwindled
into  vexatious
guerrilla
warfare
lasting
three
years
and
costing
heavily
in
men
and
money
atrocities
were
committed
by
the
native
insurrectionists
and
sad
to
relate
they
were
repaid
in
kind
it
was
argued
in
defense
of
the
army
that
the
ordinary
rules
of
warfare
were
without
terror
to
men
accustomed
to
fighting
like
savages
in
vain
did
mckinley
assure
the
filipinos
that
the
institutions
and
laws
established
in
the
islands
would
be
designed
not
for
our
satisfaction
or
for
the
expression
of
our
theoretical
views
but
for
the
happiness
peace
and
prosperity
of
the
people
of
the
philippine
islands
nothing
short
of
military
pressure
could
bring
the
warring
revolutionists
to
terms
attacks
on
republican
imperialism
the
filipino
insurrection
following
so
quickly
upon
the
ratification
of
the
treaty
with
spain
moved
the
american
opponents
of
mckinley  colonial
policies
to
redouble
their
denunciation
of
what
they
were
pleased
to
call
imperialism
senator
hoar
was
more
than
usually
caustic
in
his
indictment
of
the
new
course
the
revolt
against
american
rule
did
but
convince
him
of
the
folly
hidden
in
the
first
fateful
measures
everywhere
he
saw  conspiracy
of
silence
and
injustice  have
failed
to
discover
in
the
speeches
public
or
private
of
the
advocates
of
this
war
he
contended
in
the
senate
or
in
the
press
which
supports
it
and
them  single
expression
anywhere
of  desire
to
do
justice
to
the

of
the
philippine

or
of  desire
to
make
known
to
the

of
the

truth
of
the
case

catchwords
the
cries
the
pithy
and
pregnant
phrases
of
which
their
speech
is
full
all
mean
dominion
they
mean
perpetual
dominion
there
is
not
one
of
these
gentlemen
who
will
rise
in
his
place
and
affirm
that
if
he
were  filipino
he
would
not
do
exactly
as
the
filipinos
are
doing
that
he
would
not
despise
them
if
they
were
to
do
otherwise
so
much
at
least
they
owe
of
respect
to
the
dead
and
buried
history
the
dead
and
buried
history
so
far
as
they
can
slay
and
bury
it
of
their
country
in
the
way
of
practical
suggestions
the
senator
offered
as  solution
of
the
problem
the
recognition
of
independence
assistance
in
establishing
self
government
and
an
invitation
to
all
powers
to
join
in  guarantee
of
freedom
to
the
islands
the
republican
answer
to
mckinley
and
his
supporters
engaged
in  sanguinary
struggle
to
maintain
american
supremacy
such
talk
was
more
than
quixotic
it
was
scarcely
short
of
treasonable
they
pointed
out
the
practical
obstacles
in
the
way
of
uniform
self
government
for  collection
of
seven
million
people
ranging
in
civilization
from
the
most
ignorant
hill
men
to
the
highly
cultivated
inhabitants
of
manila
the
incidents
of
the
revolt
and
its
repression
they
admitted
were
painful
enough
but
still
nothing
as
compared
with
the
chaos
that
would
follow
the
attempt
of  people
who
had
never
had
experience
in
such
matters
to
set
up
and
sustain
democratic
institutions
they
preferred
rather
the
gradual
process
of
fitting
the
inhabitants
of
the
islands
for
self
government
this
course
in
their
eyes
though
less
poetic
was
more
in
harmony
with
the
ideals
of
humanity
having
set
out
upon
it
they
pursued
it
steadfastly
to
the
end
first
they
applied
force
without
stint
to
the
suppression
of
the
revolt
then
they
devoted
such
genius
for
colonial
administration
as
they
could
command
to
the
development
of
civil
government
commerce
and
industry

foreign
troops
were
in

the
chinese
capital
diplomatic
questions
of
the
most
delicate
character
arose
for
more
than
half  century
the
imperial
powers
of
europe
had
been
carving
up
the
chinese
empire
taking
to
themselves
territory
railway
concessions
mining
rights
ports
and
commercial
privileges
at
the
expense
of
the
huge
but
helpless
victim
the
united
states
alone
among
the
great
nations
while
as
zealous
as
any
in
the
pursuit
of
peaceful
trade
had
refrained
from
seizing
chinese
territory
or
ports
moreover
the
department
of
state
had
been
urging
european
countries
to
treat
china
with
fairness
to
respect
her
territorial
integrity
and
to
give
her
equal
trading
privileges
with
all
nations
the
american
policy
of
the
open
door
in
the
autumn
of
secretary
hay
had
addressed
to
london
berlin
rome
paris
tokyo
and
st
petersburg
his
famous
note
on
the
open
door
policy
in
china
in
this
document
he
proposed
that
existing
treaty
ports
and
vested
interests
of
the
several
foreign
countries
should
be
respected
that
the
chinese
government
should
be
permitted
to
extend
its
tariffs
to
all
ports
held
by
alien
powers
except
the
few
free
ports
and
that
there
should
be
no
discrimination
in
railway
and
port
charges
among
the
citizens
of
foreign
countries
operating
in
the
empire
to
these
principles
the
governments
addressed
by
mr
hay
finally
acceded
with
evident
reluctance
illustration
american
dominions
in
the
pacific
on
this
basis
he
then
proposed
the
settlement
that
had
to
follow
the
boxer
uprising
the
policy
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
he
said
to
the
great
powers
in
the
summer
of
is
to
seek  solution
which
may
bring
about
permanent
safety
and
peace
to
china
preserve
chinese
territorial
and
administrative
entity
protect
all
rights
guaranteed
to
friendly
powers
by
treaty
and
international
law
and
safeguard
for
the
world
the
principle
of
equal
and
impartial
trade
with
all
parts
of
the
chinese
empire
this
was  friendly
warning
to
the
world
that
the
united
states
would
not
join
in  scramble
to
punish
the
chinese
by
carving
out
more
territory
the
moment
we
acted
said
mr
hay
the
rest
of
the
world
paused
and
finally
came
over
to
our
ground
and
the
german
government
which
is
generally
brutal
but
seldom
silly
recovered
its
senses
and
climbed
down
off
its
perch
in
taking
this
position
the
secretary
of
state
did
but
reflect
the
common
sense
of
america
we
are
of
course
he
explained
opposed
to
the
dismemberment
of
that
empire
and
we
do
not
think
that
the
public
opinion
of
the
united
states
would
justify
this
government
in
taking
part
in
the
great
game
of
spoliation
now
going
on
heavy
damages
were
collected
by
the
european
powers
from
china
for
the
injuries
inflicted
upon
their
citizens
by
the
boxers
but
the
united
states
finding
the
sum
awarded
in
excess
of
the
legitimate
claims
returned
the
balance
in
the
form
of  fund
to
be
applied
to
the
education
of
chinese
students
in
american
universities  would
rather
be  think
said
mr
hay
the
dupe
of
china
than
the
chum
of
the
kaiser
by
pursuing  liberal
policy
he
strengthened
the
hold
of
the
united
states
upon
the
affections
of
the
chinese
people
and
in
the
long
run
as
he
remarked
himself
safeguarded
our
great
commercial
interests
in
that
empire
imperialism
in
the
presidential
campaign
of
it
is
not
strange
that
the
policy
pursued
by
the
republican
administration
in
disposing
of
the
questions
raised
by
the
spanish
war
became
one
of
the
first
issues
in
the
presidential
campaign
of
anticipating
attacks
from
every
quarter
the
republicans
in
renominating
mckinley
set
forth
their
position
in
clear
and
ringing
phrases
in
accepting
by
the
treaty
of
paris
the
just
responsibility
of
our
victories
in
the
spanish
war
the
president
and
senate
won
the
undoubted
approval
of
the
american
people
no
other
course
was
possible
than
to
destroy
spain  sovereignty
throughout
the
west
indies
and
in
the
philippine
islands
that
course
created
our
responsibility
before
the
world
and
with
the
unorganized
population
whom
our
intervention
had
freed
from
spain
to
provide
for
the
maintenance
of
law
and
order
and
for
the
establishment
of
good
government
and
for
the
performance
of
international
obligations
our
authority
could
not
be
less
than
our
responsibility
and
wherever
sovereign
rights
were
extended
it
became
the
high
duty
of
the
government
to
maintain
its
authority
to
put
down
armed
insurrection
and
to
confer
the
blessings
of
liberty
and
civilization
upon
all
the
rescued
peoples
the
largest
measure
of
self
government
consistent
with
their
welfare
and
our
duties
shall
be
secured
to
them
by
law
to
give
more
strength
to
their
ticket
the
republican
convention
in  whirlwind
of
enthusiasm
nominated
for
the
vice
presidency
against
his
protest
theodore
roosevelt
the
governor
of
new
york
and
the
hero
of
the
rough
riders
so
popular
on
account
of
their
cuban
campaign
the
democrats
as
expected
picked
up
the
gauntlet
thrown
down
with
such
defiance
by
the
republicans
mr
bryan
whom
they
selected
as
their
candidate
still
clung
to
the
currency
issue
but
the
main
emphasis
both
of
the
platform
and
the
appeal
for
votes
was
on
the
imperialistic
program
of
the
republican
administration
the
democrats
denounced
the
treatment
of
cuba
and
porto
rico
and
condemned
the
philippine
policy
in
sharp
and
vigorous
terms
as
we
are
not
willing
ran
the
platform
to
surrender
our
civilization
or
to
convert
the
republic
into
an
empire
we
favor
an
immediate
declaration
of
the
nation  purpose
to
give
to
the
filipinos
first  stable
form
of
government
second
independence
third
protection
from
outside
interference
the
greedy
commercialism
which
dictated
the
philippine
policy
of
the
republican
administration
attempts
to
justify
it
with
the
plea
that
it
will
pay
but
even
this
sordid
and
unworthy
plea
fails
when
brought
to
the
test
of
facts
the
war
of
criminal
aggression
against
the
filipinos
entailing
an
annual
expense
of
many
millions
has
already
cost
more
than
any
possible
profit
that
could
accrue
from
the
entire
philippine
trade
for
years
to
come
we
oppose
militarism
it
means
conquest
abroad
and
intimidation
and
oppression
at
home
it
means
the
strong
arm
which
has
ever
been
fatal
to
free
institutions
it
is
what
millions
of
our
citizens
have
fled
from
in
europe
it
will
impose
upon
our
peace
loving
people  large
standing
army
an
unnecessary
burden
of
taxation
and
would
be  constant
menace
to
their
liberties
such
was
the
tenor
of
their
appeal
to
the
voters
with
the
issues
clearly
joined
the
country
rejected
the
democratic
candidate
even
more
positively
than
four
years
before
the
popular
vote
cast
for
mckinley
was
larger
and
that
cast
for
bryan
smaller
than
in
the
silver
election
thus
vindicated
at
the
polls
mckinley
turned
with
renewed
confidence
to
the
development
of
the
policies
he
had
so
far
advanced
but
fate
cut
short
his
designs
in
the
september
following
his
second
inauguration
he
was
shot
by
an
anarchist
while
attending
the
buffalo
exposition
what  strange
and
tragic
fate
it
has
been
of
mine

on

of

of
the
gentlest
of

risen
to
the
head
of
the
state
and
all
done
to
death
by
assassins
on
september
the
vice
president
theodore
roosevelt
took
up
the
lines
of
power
that
had
fallen
from
the
hands
of
his
distinguished
chief
promising
to
continue

he
had

the

aspects
of

from

ruin
of

the

the
development
of

many
of

were
broken
up

class
was

swept
away
before  standardized

by

the

frontier
had
disappeared
the
wild

life
so
long
associated
with
america
was
gone
the
unity
of
the
nation
was
established
in
the

progress
was
most
marked
the
industrial
system
which
had
risen
and
flourished
before
the

grew
into
immense
proportions
and
the
industrial
area
was
extended
from
the

into
all
parts
of
the
country
small
business
concerns
were
transformed
into
huge
corporations
individual
plants
were

management
of
gigantic

the

rose
into

the

increased

the

the

that

for

of
its

became  competitor
of

in

in

the

the
continued
discussion
of

such
as

the
evolution
of
republican
policies
the
personality
and
early
career
of
roosevelt
on
september
when
theodore
roosevelt
took
the
oath
of
office
the
presidency
passed
to  new
generation
and  leader
of  new
type
recalling
if
comparisons
must
be
made
andrew
jackson
rather
than
any
republican
predecessor
roosevelt
was
brusque
hearty
restless
and
fond
of
action  young
fellow
of
infinite
dash
and
originality
as
john
hay
remarked
of
him
combining
the
spirit
of
his
old
college
harvard
with
the
breezy
freedom
of
the
plains
interested
in
everything  new
species
of
game  new
book  diplomatic
riddle
or  novel
theory
of
history
or
biology
though
only
forty
three
years
old
he
was
well
versed
in
the
art
of
practical
politics
coming
upon
the
political
scene
in
the
early
eighties
he
had
associated
himself
with
the
reformers
in
the
republican
party
but
he
was
no
mugwump
from
the
first
he
vehemently
preached
the
doctrine
of
party
loyalty
if
beaten
in
the
convention
he
voted
the
straight
ticket
in
the
election
for
twenty
years
he
adhered
to
this
rule
and
during  considerable
portion
of
that
period
he
held
office
as  spokesman
of
his
party
he
served
in
the
new
york
legislature
as
head
of
the
metropolitan
police
force
as
federal
civil
service
commissioner
under
president
harrison
as
assistant
secretary
of
the
navy
under
president
mckinley
and
as
governor
of
the
empire
state
political
managers
of
the
old
school
spoke
of
him
as
brilliant
but
erratic
they
soon
found
him
equal
to
the
shrewdest
in
negotiation
and
action

talking
to
the
engineer
of  railroad
train
foreign
affairs
the
panama
canal
the
most
important
foreign
question
confronting
president
roosevelt
on
the
day
of
his
inauguration
that
of
the
panama
canal
was  heritage
from
his
predecessor
the
idea
of  water
route
across
the
isthmus
long  dream
of
navigators
had
become  living
issue
after
the
historic
voyage
of
the
battleship
oregon
around
south
america
during
the
spanish
war
but
before
the
united
states
could
act
it
had
to
undo
the
clayton
bulwer
treaty
made
with
great
britain
in
providing
for
the
construction
of
the
canal
under
joint
supervision
this
was
finally
effected
by
the
hay
pauncefote
treaty
of
authorizing
the
united
states
to
proceed
alone
on
condition
that
there
should
be
no
discriminations
against
other
nations
in
the
matter
of
rates
and
charges
this
accomplished
it
was
necessary
to
decide
just
where
the
canal
should
be
built
one
group
in
congress
favored
the
route
through
nicaragua
in
fact
two
official
commissions
had
already
approved
that
location
another
group
favored
cutting
the
way
through
panama
after
purchasing
the
rights
of
the
old
french
company
which
under
the
direction
of
de
lesseps
the
hero
of
the
suez
canal
had
made  costly
failure
some
twenty
years
before
after  heated
argument
over
the
merits
of
the
two
plans
preference
was
given
to
the
panama
route
as
the
isthmus
was
then  part
of
colombia
president
roosevelt
proceeded
to
negotiate
with
the
government
at
bogota  treaty
authorizing
the
united
states
to
cut  canal
through
its
territory
the
treaty
was
easily
framed
but
it
was
rejected
by
the
colombian
senate
much
to
the
president  exasperation
you
could
no
more
make
an
agreement
with
the
colombian
rulers
he
exclaimed
than
you
could
nail
jelly
to  wall
he
was
spared
the
necessity
by  timely
revolution
on
november
panama
renounced
its
allegiance
to
colombia
and
three
days
later
the
united
states
recognized
its
independence

this
amazing
incident
was
followed
shortly
by
the
signature
of  treaty
between
panama
and
the
united
states
in
which
the
latter
secured
the
right
to
construct
the
long
discussed
canal
in
return
for  guarantee
of
independence
and
certain
cash
payments
the
rights
and

of
the
french
concern
were
then
bought
and
the
final

rather
than  sea
level
canal
was
agreed
upon

by
the
government
directly
instead
of
by
private

adopted
scientific
medicine
was
summoned
to
stamp
out

tropical
diseases
that
had
made

in
as
the
president
said
the
dirt
began
to
fly
after
surmounting
formidable
difficulties
engineering
labor
and
sanitary
the
american
forces
in
joined
the
waters
of
the
atlantic
and
the
pacific
nearly
eight
thousand
miles
were
cut
off
the
sea
voyage
from
new
york
to
san
francisco
if
any
were
inclined
to
criticize
president
roosevelt
for
the
way
in
which
he
snapped
off
negotiations
with
colombia
and
recognized
the
panama
revolutionists
their
attention
was
drawn
to
the
magnificent
outcome
of
the
affair
notwithstanding
the
treaty
with
great
britain
congress
passed  tolls
bill
discriminating
in
rates
in
favor
of
american
ships
it
was
only
on
the
urgent
insistence
of
president
wilson
that
the
measure
was
later
repealed
the
conclusion
of
the
russo
japanese
war
the
applause
which
greeted
the
president  next
diplomatic
stroke
was
unmarred
by
censure
of
any
kind
in
the
winter
of
there
broke
out
between
japan
and
russia  terrible
conflict
over
the
division
of
spoils
in
manchuria
the
fortunes
of
war
were
with
the
agile
forces
of
nippon
in
this
struggle
it
seems
president
roosevelt  sympathies
were
mainly
with
the
japanese
although
he
observed
the
proprieties
of
neutrality
at
all
events
secretary
hay
wrote
in
his
diary
on
new
year  day
that
the
president
was
quite
firm
in
his
view
that
we
cannot
permit
japan
to
be
robbed  second
time
of
her
victory
referring
to
the
fact
that
japan
ten
years
before
after
defeating
china
on
the
field
of
battle
had
been
forced
by
russia
germany
and
france
to
forego
the
fruits
of
conquest
whatever
the
president  personal
feelings
may
have
been
he
was
aware
that
japan
despite
her
triumphs
over
russia
was
staggering
under  heavy
burden
of
debt
at  suggestion
from
tokyo
he
invited
both
belligerents
in
the
summer
of
to
join
in  peace
conference
the
celerity
of
their
reply
was
aided
by
the
pressure
of
european
bankers
who
had
already
come
to  substantial
agreement
that
the
war
must
stop
after
some
delay
portsmouth
new
hampshire
was
chosen
as
the
meeting
place
for
the
spokesmen
of
the
two
warring
powers
roosevelt
presided
over
the
opening
ceremonies
with
fine
urbanity
thoroughly
enjoying
the
justly
earned
honor
of
being
for
the
moment
at
the
center
of
the
world  interest
he
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
the
conference
end
in  treaty
of
peace
and
amity
the
monroe
doctrine
applied
to
germany
less
spectacular
than
the
russo
japanese
settlement
but
not
less
important
was  diplomatic
passage
at
arms
with
germany
over
the
monroe
doctrine
this
clash
grew
out
of
the
inability
or
unwillingness
of
the
venezuelan
government
to
pay
debts
due
foreign
creditors
having
exhausted
their
patience
in
negotiations
england
and
germany
in
december
sent
battleships
to
establish
what
they
characterized
as  peaceful
blockade
of
venezuelan
ports
their
action
was
followed
by
the
rupture
of
diplomatic
relations
there
was  possibility
that
war
and
the
occupation
of
venezuelan
territory
might
result
while
unwilling
to
stand
between  latin
american
country
and
its
creditors
president
roosevelt
was
determined
that
debt
collecting
should
not
be
made
an
excuse
for
european
countries
to
seize
territory
he
therefore
urged
arbitration
of
the
dispute
winning
the
assent
of
england
and
italy
germany
with  somewhat
haughty
air
refused
to
take
the
milder
course
the
president
learning
of
this
refusal
called
the
german
ambassador
to
the
white
house
and
informed
him
in
very
precise
terms
that
unless
the
imperial
german
government
consented
to
arbitrate
admiral
dewey
would
be
ordered
to
the
scene
with
instructions
to
prevent
germany
from
seizing
any
venezuelan
territory  week
passed
and
no
answer
came
from
berlin
not
baffled
the
president
again
took
the
matter
up
with
the
ambassador
this
time
with
even
more
firmness
he
stated
in
language
admitting
of
but
one
meaning
that
unless
within
forty
eight
hours
the
emperor
consented
to
arbitration
american
battleships
already
coaled
and
cleared
would
sail
for
venezuelan
waters
the
hint
was
sufficient
the
kaiser
accepted
the
proposal
and
the
president
with
the
fine
irony
of
diplomacy
complimented
him
publicly
on
being
so
stanch
an
advocate
of
arbitration
in
terms
of
the
monroe
doctrine
this
action
meant
that
the
united
states
while
not
denying
the
obligations
of
debtors
would
not
permit
any
move
on
the
part
of
european
powers
that
might
easily
lead
to
the
temporary
or
permanent
occupation
of
latin
american
territory
the
santo
domingo
affair
the
same
issue
was
involved
in  controversy
over
santo
domingo
which
arose
in
the
dominican
republic
like
venezuela
was
heavily
in
debt
and
certain
european
countries
declared
that
unless
the
united
states
undertook
to
look
after
the
finances
of
the
embarrassed
debtor
they
would
resort
to
armed
coercion
what
was
the
united
states
to
do
the
danger
of
having
some
european
power
strongly
intrenched
in
santo
domingo
was
too
imminent
to
be
denied
president
roosevelt
acted
with
characteristic
speed
and
notwithstanding
strong
opposition
in
the
senate
was
able
in
to
effect  treaty
arrangement
which
placed
dominican
finances
under
american
supervision
in
the
course
of
the
debate
over
this
settlement  number
of
interesting
questions
arose
it
was
pertinently
asked
whether
the
american
navy
should
be
used
to
help
creditors
collect
their
debts
anywhere
in
latin
america
it
was
suggested
also
that
no
sanction
should
be
given
to
the
practice
among
european
governments
of
using
armed
force
to
collect
private
claims
opponents
of
president
roosevelt  policy
and
they
were
neither
few
nor
insignificant
urged
that
such
matters
should
be
referred
to
the
hague
court
or
to
special
international
commissions
for
arbitration
to
this
the
answer
was
made
that
the
united
states
could
not
surrender
any
question
coming
under
the
terms
of
the
monroe
doctrine
to
the
decision
of
an
international
tribunal
the
position
of
the
administration
was
very
clearly
stated
by
president
roosevelt
himself
the
country
he
said
would
certainly
decline
to
go
to
war
to
prevent  foreign
government
from
collecting  just
debt
on
the
other
hand
it
is
very
inadvisable
to
permit
any
foreign
power
to
take
possession
even
temporarily
of
the
customs
houses
of
an
american
republic
in
order
to
enforce
the
payment
of
its
obligations
for
such  temporary
occupation
might
turn
into  permanent
occupation
the
only
escape
from
these
alternatives
may
at
any
time
be
that
we
must
ourselves
undertake
to
bring
about
some
arrangement
by
which
so
much
as
possible
of  just
obligation
shall
be
paid
the
monroe
doctrine
was
negative
it
denied
to
european
powers  certain
liberty
of
operation
in
this
hemisphere
the
positive
obligations
resulting
from
its
application
by
the
united
states
were
points
now
emphasized
and
developed
the
hague
conference
the
controversies
over
latin
american
relations
and
his
part
in
bringing
the
russo
japanese
war
to  close
naturally
made  deep
impression
upon
roosevelt
turning
his
mind
in
the
direction
of
the
peaceful
settlement
of
international
disputes
the
subject
was
moreover
in
the
air
as
if
conscious
of
impending
calamity
the
statesmen
of
the
old
world
to
all
outward
signs
at
least
seemed
searching
for  way
to
reduce
armaments
and
avoid
the
bloody
and
costly
trial
of
international
causes
by
the
ancient
process
of
battle
it
was
the
czar
nicholas
ii
fated
to
die
in
one
of
the
terrible
holocausts
which
he
helped
to
bring
upon
mankind
who
summoned
the
delegates
of
the
nations
in
the
first
hague
peace
conference
in
the
conference
did
nothing
to
reduce
military
burdens
or
avoid
wars
but
it
did
recognize
the
right
of
friendly
nations
to
offer
the
services
of
mediation
to
countries
at
war
and
did
establish  court
at
the
hague
for
the
arbitration
of
international
disputes
encouraged
by
this
experiment
feeble
as
it
was
president
roosevelt
in
proposed  second
conference
yielding
to
the
czar
the
honor
of
issuing
the
call
at
this
great
international
assembly
held
at
the
hague
in
the
representatives
of
the
united
states
proposed  plan
for
the
compulsory
arbitration
of
certain
matters
of
international
dispute
this
was
rejected
with
contempt
by
germany
reduction
of
armaments
likewise
proposed
in
the
conference
was
again
deferred
in
fact
nothing
was
accomplished
beyond
agreement
upon
certain
rules
for
the
conduct
of
civilized
warfare
casting  somewhat
lurid
light
upon
the
pacific
intentions
of
most
of
the
powers
assembled
the
world
tour
of
the
fleet
as
if
to
assure
the
world
then
that
the
united
states
placed
little
reliance
upon
the
frail
reed
of
peace
conferences
roosevelt
the
following
year
made
an
imposing
display
of
american
naval
power
by
sending  fleet
of
sixteen
battleships
on  tour
around
the
globe
on
his
own
authority
he
ordered
the
ships
to
sail
out
of
hampton
roads
and
circle
the
earth
by
way
of
the
straits
of
magellan
san
francisco
australia
the
philippines
china
japan
and
the
suez
canal
this
enterprise
was
not
as
some
critics
claimed  mere
boyish
flourish
president
roosevelt
knew
how
deep
was
the
influence
of
sea
power
on
the
fate
of
nations
he
was
aware
that
no
country
could
have  wide
empire
of
trade
and
dominion
without
force
adequate
to
sustain
it
the
voyage
around
the
world
therefore
served  double
purpose
it
interested
his
own
country
in
the
naval
program
of
the
government
and
it
reminded
other
powers
that
the
american
giant
though
quiet
was
not
sleeping
in
the
midst
of
international
rivalries
colonial
administration  constitutional
question
settled
in
colonial
administration
as
in
foreign
policy
president
roosevelt
advanced
with
firm
step
in  path
already
marked
out
president
mckinley
had
defined
the
principles
that
were
to
control
the
development
of
porto
rico
and
the
philippines
the
republican
party
had
announced  program
of
pacification
gradual
self
government
and
commercial
improvement
the
only
remaining
question
of
importance
to
use
the
popular
phrase
does
the
constitution
follow
the
flag
had
been
answered
by
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
although
it
was
well
known
that
the
constitution
did
not
contemplate
the
government
of
dependencies
such
as
the
philippines
and
porto
rico
the
court
by
generous
and
ingenious
interpretations
found  way
for
congress
to
apply
any
reasonable
rules
required
by
the
occasion
porto
rico
the
government
of
porto
rico
was  relatively
simple
matter
it
was  single
island
with  fairly
homogeneous
population
apart
from
the
spanish
upper
class
for  time
after
military
occupation
in
it
was
administered
under
military
rule
this
was
succeeded
by
the
establishment
of
civil
government
under
the
organic
act
passed
by
congress
in
the
law
assured
to
the
porto
ricans
american
protection
but
withheld
american
citizenship  boon
finally
granted
in
it
provided
for  governor
and
six
executive
secretaries
appointed
by
the
president
with
the
approval
of
the
senate
and
for  legislature
of
two
houses
one
elected
by
popular
native
vote
and
an
upper
chamber
composed
of
the
executive
secretaries
and
five
other
persons
appointed
in
the
same
manner
thus
the
united
states
turned
back
to
the
provincial
system
maintained
by
england
in
virginia
or
new
york
in
old
colonial
days
the
natives
were
given  voice
in
their
government
and
the
power
of
initiating
laws
but
the
final
word
both
in
law
making
and
administration
was
vested
in
officers
appointed
in
washington
such
was
the
plan
under
which
the
affairs
of
porto
rico
were
conducted
by
president
roosevelt
it
lasted
until
the
new
organic
act
of
illustration
photograph
from
underwood
and
underwood  y  sugar
mill
porto
rico
the
philippines
the
administration
of
the
philippines
presented
far
more
difficult
questions
the
number
of
islands
the
variety
of
languages
and
races
the
differences
in
civilization
all
combined
to
challenge
the
skill
of
the
government
moreover
there
was
raging
in  stubborn
revolt
against
american
authority
which
had
to
be
faced
following
the
lines
laid
down
by
president
mckinley
the
evolution
of
american
policy
fell
into
three
stages
at
first
the
islands
were
governed
directly
by
the
president
under
his
supreme
military
power
in  civilian
commission
headed
by
william
howard
taft
was
selected
by
the
president
and
charged
with
the
government
of
the
provinces
in
which
order
had
been
restored
six
years
later
under
the
terms
of
an
organic
act
passed
by
congress
in
the
third
stage
was
reached
the
local
government
passed
into
the
hands
of  governor
and
commission
appointed
by
the
president
and
senate
and  legislature
one
house
elected
by
popular

intact

congress
under

wilson  leadership
carried
the

into

by
making

thus
by
the
steady
pursuit

policy
self

extended

extinguished

cuba
though
nominally

also
presented
problems
to
the

at

in
the
fine
enthusiasm
that
accompanied
the
declaration

congress
unmindful
of

recognized

or
control
over
said
island
except
for
the
pacification
thereof
in
the
settlement
that
followed

however
it
was
deemed
undesirable
to
set
the
young
republic
adrift
upon
the
stormy
sea
of
international
politics
without  guiding
hand
before
withdrawing
american
troops
from
the

in

enacted
and
required
cuba
to
approve  series
of
restrictions
known
as
the
platt

limiting
her
power
to
incur
indebtedness
securing
the
right
of
the

made
strong
protests
against
what
they
deemed
infringements
of
their
sovereignty
but
finally
with
good
grace
accepted
their
fate
even
when
in
president
roosevelt
landed
american
troops
in
the
island
to
quell  domestic
dissension
they
acquiesced
in
the
action
evidently
regarding
it
as  distinct
warning
that
they
should
learn
to
manage
their
elections
in
an
orderly
manner
the
roosevelt
domestic
policies
social
questions
to
the
front
from
the
day
of
his
inauguration
to
the
close
of
his
service
in
president
roosevelt
in
messages
speeches
and
interviews
kept
up  lively
and
interesting
discussion
of
trusts
capital
labor
poverty
riches
lawbreaking
good
citizenship
and
kindred
themes
many  subject
previously
touched
upon
only
by
representatives
of
the
minor
and
dissenting
parties
he
dignified
by  careful
examination
that
he
did
this
with
any
fixed
design
or
policy
in
mind
does
not
seem
to
be
the
case
he
admitted
himself
that
when
he
became
president
he
did
not
have
in
hand
any
settled
or
far
reaching
plan
of
social
betterment
he
did
have
however
serious
convictions
on
general
principles  was
bent
upon
making
the
government
he
wrote
the
most
efficient
possible
instrument
in
helping
the
people
of
the
united
states
to
better
themselves
in
every
way
politically
socially
and
industrially  believed
with
all
my
heart
in
real
and
thorough
going
democracy
and  wished
to
make
the
democracy
industrial
as
well
as
political
although  had
only
partially
formulated
the
method  believed
we
should
follow
it
is
thus
evident
at
least
that
he
had
departed  long
way
from
the
old
idea
of
the
government
as
nothing
but  great
policeman
keeping
order
among
the
people
in  struggle
over
the
distribution
of
the
nation  wealth
and
resources
roosevelt  view
of
the
constitution
equally
significant
was
roosevelt  attitude
toward
the
constitution
and
the
office
of
president
he
utterly
repudiated
the
narrow
construction
of
our
national
charter
he
held
that
the
constitution
should
be
treated
as
the
greatest
document
ever
devised
by
the
wit
of
man
to
aid  people
in
exercising
every
power
necessary
for
its
own
betterment
not
as  strait
jacket
cunningly
fashioned
to
strangle
growth
he
viewed
the
presidency
as
he
did
the
constitution
strict
constructionists
of
the
jeffersonian
school
of
whom
there
were
many
on
occasion
even
in
the
republican
party
had
taken  view
that
the
president
could
do
nothing
that
he
was
not
specifically
authorized
by
the
constitution
to
do
roosevelt
took
exactly
the
opposite
position
it
was
his
opinion
that
it
was
not
only
the
president  right
but
his
duty
to
do
anything
that
the
needs
of
the
nation
demanded
unless
such
action
was
forbidden
by
the
constitution
or
the
laws
he
went
on
to
say
that
he
acted
for
the
common
well
being
of
all
our
people
whenever
and
in
whatever
manner
was
necessary
unless
prevented
by
direct
constitutional
or
legislative
prohibition
the
trusts
and
railways
to
the
trust
question
roosevelt
devoted
especial
attention
this
was
unavoidable
by
far
the
larger
part
of
the
business
of
the
country
was
done
by
corporations
as
distinguished
from
partnerships
and
individual
owners
the
growth
of
these
gigantic
aggregations
of
capital
had
been
the
leading
feature
in
american
industrial
development
during
the
last
two
decades
of
the
nineteenth
century
in
the
conquest
of
business
by
trusts
and
the
resulting
private
fortunes
of
great
magnitude
the
populists
and
the
democrats
had
seen  grievous
danger
to
the
republic
plutocracy
has
taken
the
place
of
democracy
the
tariff
breeds
trusts
let
us
destroy
therefore
the
tariff
and
the
trusts
such
was
the
battle
cry
which
had
been
taken
up
by
bryan
and
his
followers
president
roosevelt
countered
vigorously
he
rejected
the
idea
that
the
trusts
were
the
product
of
the
tariff
or
of
governmental
action
of
any
kind
he
insisted
that
they
were
the
outcome
of
natural
economic
forces
destructive
competition
among
business
men
compelling
them
to
avoid
ruin
by
cooperation
in
fixing
prices
the
growth
of
markets
on  national
scale
and
even
international
scale
calling
for
vast
accumulations
of
capital
to
carry
on
such
business
the
possibility
of
immense
savings
by
the
union
of
many
plants
under
one
management
in
the
corporation
he
saw  new
stage
in
the
development
of
american
industry
unregulated
competition
he
regarded
as
the
source
of
evils
which
all
men
concede
must
be
remedied
if
this
civilization
of
ours
is
to
survive
the
notion
therefore
that
these
immense
business
concerns
should
be
or
could
be
broken
up
by  decree
of
law
roosevelt
considered
absurd
at
the
same
time
he
proposed
that
evil
trusts
should
be
prevented
from
wrong
doing
of
any
kind
that
is
punished
for
plain
swindling
for
making
agreements
to
limit
output
for
refusing
to
sell
to
customers
who
dealt
with
rival
firms
and
for
conspiracies
with
railways
to
ruin
competitors
by
charging
high
freight
rates
and
for
similar
abuses
accordingly
he
proposed
not
the
destruction
of
the
trusts
but
their
regulation
by
the
government
this
he
contended
would
preserve
the
advantages
of
business
on  national
scale
while
preventing
the
evils
that
accompanied
it
the
railway
company
he
declared
to
be  public
servant
its
rates
should
be
just
to
and
open
to
all
shippers
alike
so
he
answered
those
who
thought
that
trusts
and
railway
combinations
were
private
concerns
to
be
managed
solely
by
their
owners
without
let
or
hindrance
and
also
those
who
thought
trusts
and
railway
combinations
could
be
abolished
by
tariff
reduction
or
criminal
prosecution
the
labor
question
on
the
labor
question
then
pressing
to
the
front
in
public
interest
president
roosevelt
took
advanced
ground
for
his
time
he
declared
that
the
working
man
single
handed
and
empty
handed
threatened
with
starvation
if
unemployed
was
no
match
for
the
employer
who
was
able
to
bargain
and
wait
this
led
him
accordingly
to
accept
the
principle
of
the
trade
union
namely
that
only
by
collective
bargaining
can
labor
be
put
on  footing
to
measure
its
strength
equally
with
capital
while
he
severely
arraigned
labor
leaders
who
advocated
violence
and
destructive
doctrines
he
held
that
the
organization
of
labor
into
trade
unions
and
federations
is
necessary
is
beneficent
and
is
one
of
the
greatest
possible
agencies
in
the
attainment
of  true
industrial
as
well
as  true
political
democracy
in
the
united
states
the
last
resort
of
trade
unions
in
labor
disputes
the
strike
he
approved
in
case
negotiations
failed
to
secure  fair
deal
he
thought
however
that
labor
organizations
even
if
wisely
managed
could
not
solve
all
the
pressing
social
questions
of
the
time
the
aid
of
the
government
at
many
points
he
believed
to
be
necessary
to
eliminate
undeserved
poverty
industrial
diseases
unemployment
and
the
unfortunate
consequences
of
industrial
accidents
in
his
first
message
of
for
instance
he
urged
that
workers
injured
in
industry
should
have
certain
and
ample
compensation
from
time
to
time
he
advocated
other
legislation
to
obtain
what
he
called  larger
measure
of
social
and
industrial
justice
great
riches
and
taxation
even
the
challenge
of
the
radicals
such
as
the
populists
who
alleged
that
the
toil
of
millions
is
boldly
stolen
to
build
up
colossal
fortunes
for  few
challenges
which
his
predecessors
did
not
consider
worthy
of
notice
president
roosevelt
refused
to
let
pass
without
an
answer
in
his
first
message
he
denied
the
truth
of
the
common
saying
that
the
rich
were
growing
richer
and
the
poor
were
growing
poorer
he
asserted
that
on
the
contrary
the
average
man
wage
worker
farmer
and
small
business
man
was
better
off
than
ever
before
in
the
history
of
our
country
that
there
had
been
abuses
in
the
accumulation
of
wealth
he
did
not
pretend
to
ignore
but
he
believed
that
even
immense
fortunes
on
the
whole
represented
positive
benefits
conferred
upon
the
country
nevertheless
he
felt
that
grave
dangers
to
the
safety
and
the
happiness
of
the
people
lurked
in
great
inequalities
of
wealth
in
he
wrote
that
he
wished
it
were
in
his
power
to
prevent
the
heaping
up
of
enormous
fortunes
the
next
year
to
the
astonishment
of
many
leaders
in
his
own
party
he
boldly
announced
in  message
to
congress
that
he
approved
both
income
and
inheritance
taxes
then
generally
viewed
as
populist
or
democratic
measures
he
even
took
the
stand
that
such
taxes
should
be
laid
in
order
to
bring
about  more
equitable
distribution
of
wealth
and
greater
equality
of
opportunity
among
citizens
legislative
and
executive
activities
economic
legislation
when
president
roosevelt
turned
from
the
field
of
opinion
he
found
himself
in  different
sphere
many
of
his
views
were
too
advanced
for
the
members
of
his
party
in
congress
and
where
results
depended
upon
the
making
of
new
laws
his
progress
was
slow
nevertheless
in
his
administrations
several
measures
were
enacted
that
bore
the
stamp
of
his
theories
though
it
could
hardly
be
said
that
he
dominated
congress
to
the
same
degree
as
did
some
other
presidents
the
hepburn
railway
act
of
enlarged
the
interstate
commerce
commission
it
extended
the
commission  power
over
oil
pipe
lines
express
companies
and
other
interstate
carriers
it
gave
the
commission
the
right
to
reduce
rates
found
to
be
unreasonable
and
discriminatory
it
forbade
midnight
tariffs
that
is
sudden
changes
in
rates
favoring
certain
shippers
and
it
prohibited
common
carriers
from
transporting
goods
owned
by
themselves
especially
coal
except
for
their
own
proper
use
two
important
pure
food
and
drug
laws
enacted
during
the
same
year
were
designed
to
protect
the
public
against
diseased
meats
and
deleterious
foods
and
drugs  significant
piece
of
labor
legislation
was
an
act
of
the
same
congress
making
interstate
railways
liable
to
damages
for
injuries
sustained
by
their
employees
when
this
measure
was
declared
unconstitutional
by
the
supreme
court
it
was
reenacted
with
the
objectionable
clauses
removed  second
installment
of
labor
legislation
was
offered
in
the
law
of
limiting
the
hours
of
railway
employees
engaged
as
trainmen

roosevelt
no
less
than
railway
and
industrial
questions
indeed
in
his
first
message
to
congress
he
placed
the
conservation
of
natural
resources
among
the
most
vital
internal
problems
of
the
age
and
forcibly
emphasized
an
issue
that
had
been
discussed
in  casual
way
since
cleveland  first
administration
the
suggestion
evoked
an
immediate
response
in
congress
under
the
leadership
of
senator
newlands
of
nevada
the
reclamation
act
of
was
passed
providing
for
the
redemption
of
the
desert
areas
of
the
west
the
proceeds
from
the
sale
of

were
dedicated
to
the
construction
of

dams

to
hold

and
divert

furthermore
it
was
stipulated
that

to
continue
the
good

forever
construction
was
started
immediately

terms
of
the

within
seventeen

about
acres
had
been
reclaimed
and
more

the

urged

in
when
the

was
created
in

noteworthy
advances
were
made
in
the
administration

the
science
of
forestry
was
improved
and
knowledge
of
the
subject
spread
among
the
people

in
the
national

available
for

were
opened

instead

the

was
enlarged
from

being
added
in

the

the

held
until

was
prepared
to
enact

for
the
disposition

them
in
the
public
interest
prosecutions
were
instituted
against
men
who
had
obtained
public
lands
by
fraud
and
vast
tracts
were
recovered
for
the
national

an
agitation
was
begun
which
bore
fruit
under
the
administrations
of

in

reserving
to
the

the
ownership
of

to

for  period
of
years
the
prosecution
of
the
trusts
as
an
executive
president
roosevelt
was
also  distinct
personality
his
discrimination
between
good
and
bad
trusts
led
him
to
prosecute
some
of
them
with
vigor
on
his
initiative
the
northern
securities
company
formed
to
obtain
control
of
certain
great
western
railways
was
dissolved
by
order
of
the

hardly  week
passed
without
stirring
news
of
wrong
doers
and
malefactors
haled
into
federal
courts
the
great
coal
strike
the
roosevelt
theory
that
the
president
could
do
anything
for
public
welfare
not
forbidden
by
the
constitution
and
the
laws
was
put
to  severe
test
in  strike
of
the
anthracite
coal
miners
which
started
in
the
summer
ran
late
into
the
autumn
industries
were
paralyzed
for
the
want
of
coal
cities
were
threatened
with
the
appalling
menace
of  winter
without
heat
governors
and
mayors
were
powerless
and
appealed
for
aid
the
mine
owners
rejected
the
demands
of
the
men
and
refused
to
permit
the
arbitration
of
the
points
in
dispute
although
john
mitchell
the
leader
of
the
miners
repeatedly
urged
it
after
observing
closely
the
course
affairs
president
roosevelt
made
up
his
mind
that
the
situation
was
intolerable
he
arranged
to
have
the
federal
troops
if
necessary
take
possession
of
the
mines
and
operate
them
until
the
strike
could
be
settled
he
then
invited
the
contestants
to
the
white
house
and
by
dint
of
hard
labor
induced
them
to
accept
as  substitute
or
compromise
arbitration
by  commission
which
he
appointed
thus
by
stepping
outside
the
constitution
and
acting
as
the
first
citizen
of
the
land
president
roosevelt
averted  crisis
of
great
magnitude
the
election
of
the
views
and
measures
which
he
advocated
with
such
vigor
aroused
deep
hostility
within
as
well
as
without
his
party
there
were
rumors
of  republican
movement
to
defeat
his
nomination
in
and
it
was
said
that
the
financial
and

interests
were
in

and
favoring
labor
unions
when
the
republican
convention
assembled
in
chicago
however
the
opposition
disappeared
and
roosevelt
was
nominated
by
acclamation
this
was
the
signal
for  change
on
the
part
of
democratic
leaders
they
denounced
the
president
as
erratic
dangerous
and
radical
and
decided
to
assume
the
moderate
role
themselves
they
put
aside
mr
bryan
and
selected
as
their
candidate
judge
alton  parker
of
new
york  man
who
repudiated
free
silver
and
made  direct
appeal
for
the
conservative
vote
the
outcome
of
the
reversal
was
astounding
judge
parker  vote
fell
more
than  million
below
that
cast
for
bryan
in
of
the
electoral
votes
he
received
only
roosevelt
in
addition
to
sweeping
the
republican
sections
even
invaded
democratic
territory
carrying
the
state
of
missouri
thus
vindicated
at
the
polls
he
became
more
outspoken
than
ever
his
leadership
in
the
party
was
so
widely
recognized
that
he
virtually
selected
his
own
successor
the
administration
of
president
taft
the
campaign
of
long
before
the
end
of
his
elective
term
president
roosevelt
let
it
be
known
that
he
favored
as
his
successor
william
howard
taft
of
ohio
his
secretary
of
war
to
attain
this
end
he
used
every
shred
of
his
powerful
influence
when
the
republican
convention
assembled
mr
taft
easily
won
the
nomination
though
the
party
platform
was
conservative
in
tone
he
gave
it  progressive
tinge
by
expressing
his
personal
belief
in
the
popular
election
of
united
states
senators
an
income
tax
and
other
liberal
measures
president
roosevelt
announced
his
faith
in
the
republican
candidate
and
appealed
to
the
country
for
his
election
the
turn
in
republican
affairs
now
convinced
mr
bryan
that
the
signs
were
propitious
for  third
attempt
to
win
the
presidency
the
disaster
to
judge
parker
had
taught
the
party
that
victory
did
not
lie
in  conservative
policy
with
little
difficulty
therefore
the
veteran
leader
from
nebraska
once
more
rallied
the
democrats
around
his
standard
won
the
nomination
and
wrote  platform
vigorously
attacking
the
tariff
trusts
and
monopolies
supported
by  loyal
following
he
entered
the
lists
only
to
meet
another
defeat
though
he
polled
almost  million
and  half
more
votes
than
did
judge
parker
in
the
palm
went
to
mr
taft
the
tariff
revision
and
party
dissensions
at
the
very
beginning
of
his
term
president
taft
had
to
face
the
tariff
issue
he
had
met
it
in
the
campaign
moved
by
the
democratic
demand
for  drastic
reduction
he
had
expressed
opinions
which
were
thought
to
imply  downward
revision
the
democrats
made
much
of
the
implication
and
the
republicans
from
the
middle
west
rejoiced
in
it
pressure
was
coming
from
all
sides
more
than
ten
years
had
elapsed
since
the
enactment
of
the
dingley
bill
and
the
position
of
many
industries
had
been
altered
with
the
course
of
time
evidently
the
day
for
revision
at
best  thankless
task
had
arrived
taft
accepted
the
inevitable
and
called
congress
in  special
session
until
the
midsummer
of
republican
senators
and
representatives
wrangled
over
tariff
schedules
the
president
making
little
effort
to
influence
their
decisions
when
on
august
the
payne
aldrich
bill
became  law  breach
had
been
made
in
republican
ranks
powerful
senators
from
the
middle
west
had
spoken
angrily
against
many
of
the
high
rates
imposed
by
the
bill
they
had
even
broken
with
their
party
colleagues
to
vote
against
the
entire
scheme
of
tariff
revision
the
income
tax
amendment
the
rift
in
party
harmony
was
widened
by
another
serious
difference
of
opinion
during
the
debate
on
the
tariff
bill
there
was  concerted
movement
to
include
in
it
an
income
tax
provision
this
in
spite
of
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
in
declaring
it
unconstitutional
conservative
men
were
alarmed
by
the
evident
willingness
of
some
members
to
flout  solemn
decree
of
that
eminent
tribunal
at
the
same
time
they
saw  powerful
combination
of
republicans
and
democrats
determined
upon
shifting
some
of
the
burden
of
taxation
to
large
incomes
in
the
press
of
circumstances  compromise
was
reached
the
income
tax
bill
was
dropped
for
the
present
but
congress
passed
the
sixteenth
amendment
to
the
constitution
authorizing
taxes
upon
incomes
from
whatever
source
they
might
be
derived
without
reference
to
any
apportionment
among
the
states
on
the
basis
of
population
the
states
ratified
the
amendment
and
early
in
it
was
proclaimed
president
taft  policies
after
the
enactment
of
the
tariff
bill
taft
continued
to
push
forward
with
his
legislative
program
he
recommended
and
congress
created  special
court
of
commerce
with
jurisdiction
among
other
things
over
appeals
from
the
interstate
commerce
commission
thus
facilitating
judicial
review
of
the
railway
rates
fixed
and
the
orders
issued
by
that
body
this
measure
was
quickly
followed
by
an
act
establishing  system
of
postal
savings
banks
in
connection
with
the
post
office  scheme
which
had
long
been
opposed
by
private
banks
two
years
later
congress
defied
the
lobby
of
the
express
companies
and
supplemented
the
savings
banks
with  parcels
post
system
thus
enabling
the
american
postal
service
to
catch
up
with
that
of
other
progressive
nations
with  view
to
improving
the
business
administration
of
the
federal
government
the
president
obtained
from
congress  large
appropriation
for
an
economy
and
efficiency
commission
charged
with
the
duty
of
inquiring
into
wasteful
and
obsolete
methods
and
recommending
improved
devices
and
practices
the
chief
result
of
this
investigation
was  vigorous
report
in
favor
of  national
budget
system
which
soon
found
public
backing
president
taft
negotiated
with
england
and
france
general
treaties
providing
for
the
arbitration
of
disputes
which
were
justiciable
in
character
even
though
they
might
involve
questions
of
vital
interest
and
national
honor
they
were
coldly
received
in
the
senate
and
so
amended
that
taft
abandoned
them
altogether  tariff
reciprocity
agreement
with
canada
however
he
forced
through
congress
in
the
face
of
strong
opposition
from
his
own
party
after
making  serious
breach
in
republican
ranks
he
was
chagrined
to
see
the
whole
scheme
come
to
naught
by
the
overthrow
of
the
liberals
in
the
canadian
elections
of
prosecution
of
the
trusts
the
party
schism
was
even
enlarged
by
what
appeared
to
be
the
successful
prosecution
of
several
great
combinations
in
two
important
cases
the
supreme
court
ordered
the
dissolution
of
the
standard
oil
company
and
the
american
tobacco
company
on
the
ground
that
they
violated
the
sherman
anti
trust
law
in
taking
this
step
chief
justice
white
was
at
some
pains
to
state
that
the
law
did
not
apply
to
combinations
which
did
not
unduly
restrain
trade
his
remark
construed
to
mean
that
the
court
would
not
interfere
with
corporations
as
such
became
the
subject
of  popular
outcry
against
the
president
and
the
judges
progressive
insurgency
and
the
election
of
growing
dissensions
all
in
all
taft  administration
from
the
first
day
had
been
disturbed
by
party
discord
high
words
had
passed
over
the
tariff
bill
and
disgruntled
members
of
congress
could
not
forget
them
to
differences
over
issues
were
added
quarrels
between
youth
and
old
age
in
the
house
of
representatives
there
developed  group
of
young
insurgent
republicans
who
resented
the
dominance
of
the
speaker
joseph
cannon
and
other
members
of
the
old
guard
as
they
named
the
men
of
long
service
and
conservative
minds
in
the
insurgents
went
so
far
as
to
join
with
the
democrats
in  movement
to
break
the
speaker  sway
by
ousting
him
from
the
rules
committee
and
depriving
him
of
the
power
to
appoint
its
members
the
storm
was
brewing
in
the
autumn
of
that
year
the
democrats
won  clear
majority
in
the
house
of
representatives
and
began
an
open
battle
with
president
taft
by
demanding
an
immediate
downward
revision
of
the
tariff
the
rise
of
the
progressive
republicans
preparatory
to
the
campaign
of
the
dissenters
within
the
republican
party
added
the
prefix
progressive
to
their
old
title
and
began
to
organize  movement
to
prevent
the
renomination
of
mr
taft
as
early
as
january
they
formed  progressive
republican
league
at
the
home
of
senator
la
follette
of
wisconsin
and
launched
an
attack
on
the
taft
measures
and
policies
in
october
they
indorsed
mr
la
follette
as
the
logical
republican
candidate
and
appealed
to
the
party
for
support
the
controversy
over
the
tariff
had
grown
into  formidable
revolt
against
the
occupant
of
the
white
house
roosevelt
in
the
field
after
looking
on
for  while
ex
president
roosevelt
took  hand
in
the
fray
soon
after
his
return
in
from  hunting
trip
in
africa
and  tour
in
europe
he
made  series
of
addresses
in
which
he
formulated  progressive
program
in  speech
in
kansas
he
favored
regulation
of
the
trusts  graduated
income
tax
bearing
heavily
on
great
fortunes
tariff
revision
schedule
by
schedule
conservation
of
natural
resources
labor
legislation
the
direct
primary
and
the
recall
of
elective
officials
in
an
address
before
the
ohio
state
constitutional
convention
in
february
he
indorsed
the
initiative
and
referendum
and
announced  doctrine
known
as
the
recall
of
judicial
decisions
this
was  new
and
radical
note
in
american
politics
an
ex
president
of
the
united
states
proposed
that
the
people
at
the
polls
should
have
the
right
to
reverse
the
decision
of  judge
who
set
aside
any
act
of  state
legislature
passed
in
the
interests
of
social
welfare
the
progressive
republicans
impressed
by
these
addresses
turned
from
la
follette
to
roosevelt
and
on
february
induced
him
to
come
out
openly
as  candidate
against
taft
for
the
republican
nomination
the
split
in
the
republican
party
the
country
then
witnessed
the
strange
spectacle
of
two
men
who
had
once
been
close
companions
engaged
in  bitter
rivalry
to
secure  majority
of
the
delegates
to
the
republican
convention
to
be
held
at
chicago
when
the
convention
assembled
about
one
fourth
of
the
seats
were
contested
the
delegates
for
both
candidates
loudly
proclaiming
the
regularity
of
their
election
in
deciding
between
the
contestants
the
national
committee
after
the
usual
hearings
settled
the
disputes
in
such  way
that
taft
received  safe
majority
after  week
of
negotiation
roosevelt
and
his
followers
left
the
republican
party
most
of
his
supporters
withdrew
from
the
convention
and
the
few
who
remained
behind
refused
to
answer
the
roll
call
undisturbed
by
this
formidable
bolt
the
regular
republicans
went
on
with
their
work
they
renominated
mr
taft
and
put
forth  platform
roundly
condemning
such
progressive
doctrines
as
the
recall
of
judges
the
formation
of
the
progressive
party
the
action
of
the
republicans
in
seating
the
taft
delegates
was
vigorously
denounced
by
roosevelt
he
declared
that
the
convention
had
no
claim
to
represent
the
voters
of
the
republican
party
that
any
candidate
named
by
it
would
be
the
beneficiary
of  successful
fraud
and
that
it
would
be
deeply
discreditable
to
any
man
to
accept
the
convention  approval
under
such
circumstances
the
bitterness
of
his
followers
was
extreme
on
july  call
went
forth
for  progressive
convention
to
be
held
in
chicago
on
august
the
assembly
which
duly
met
on
that
day
was  unique
political
conference
prominence
was
given
to
women
delegates
and
politicians
were
notably
absent
roosevelt
himself
who
was
cheered
as  conquering
hero
made
an
impassioned
speech
setting
forth
his
confession
of
faith
he
was
nominated
by
acclamation
governor
hiram
johnson
of
california
was
selected
as
his
companion
candidate
for
vice
president
the
platform
endorsed
such
political
reforms
as
woman
suffrage
direct
primaries
the
initiative
referendum
and
recall
popular
election
of
united
states
senators
and
the
short
ballot
it
favored  program
of
social
legislation
including
the
prohibition
of
child
labor
and
minimum
wages
for
women
it
approved
the
regulation
rather
than
the
dissolution
of
the
trusts
like
apostles
in  new
and
lofty
cause
the
progressives
entered  vigorous
campaign
for
the
election
of
their
distinguished
leader
woodrow
wilson
and
the
election
of
with
the
republicans
divided
victory
loomed
up
before
the
democrats
naturally  terrific
contest
over
the
nomination
occurred
at
their
convention
in
baltimore
champ
clark
speaker
of
the
house
of
representatives
and
governor
woodrow
wilson
of
new
jersey
were
the
chief
contestants
after
tossing
to
and
fro
for
seven
long
hot
days
and
taking
forty
six
ballots
the
delegates
powerfully
influenced
by
mr
bryan
finally
decided
in
favor
of
the
governor
as  professor  writer
on
historical
and
political
subjects
and
the
president
of
princeton
university
mr
wilson
had
become
widely
known
in
public
life
as
the
governor
of
new
jersey
he
had
attracted
the
support
of
the
progressives
in
both
parties
with
grim
determination
he
had
waged
war
on
the
bosses
and
pushed
through
the
legislature
measures
establishing
direct
primaries
regulating
public
utilities
and
creating  system
of
workmen  compensation
in
industries
during
the
presidential
campaign
that
followed
governor
wilson
toured
the
country
and
aroused
great
enthusiasm
by  series
of
addresses
later
published
under
the
title
of
the
new
freedom
he
declared
that
the
government
of
the
united
states
is
at
present
the
foster
child
of
the
special
interests
he
proposed
to
free
the
country
by
breaking
the
dominance
of
the
big
bankers
the
big
manufacturers
the
big
masters
of
commerce
the
heads
of
railroad
corporations
and
of
steamship
corporations
in
the
election
governor
wilson
easily
secured  majority
of
the
electoral
votes
and
his
party
while
retaining
possession
of
the
house
of
representatives
captured
the
senate
as
well
the
popular
verdict
however
indicated  state
of
confusion
in
the
country
the
combined
progressive
and
republican
vote
exceeded
that
of
the
democrats
by
the
socialists
with
eugene  debs
as
their
candidate
again
polled
about
votes
more
than
double
the
number
received
four
years

thus
as
the
result
of
an
extraordinary
upheaval
the
republicans
after
holding
the
office
of
president
for
sixteen
years
passed
out
of
power
and
the
government

fearlessly
the
political

which
dominated

the
whole

shock
six
years
later
henry  lloyd
in  powerful
book
entitled

attacked
in

certain

an
author
of

to

the
ruthless
methods
of
that

lincoln
steffens
exposed
the
sordid
character
of
politics
in
several
municipalities
in  series
of
articles
bearing
the
painful
heading
the
shame
of
the
cities
the
critical
spirit
appeared
in
almost
every
form
in
weekly
and
monthly
magazines
in
essays
and
pamphlets
in
editorials
and
news
stories
in
novels
like
churchill  coniston
and
sinclair  the
jungle
it
became
so
savage
and
so
wanton
that
the
opening
years
of
the
twentieth
century
were
well
named
the
age
of
the
muckrakers
the
subjects
of
the
criticism
in
this
outburst
of
invective
nothing
was
spared
it
was
charged
that
each
of
the
political
parties
had
fallen
into
the
hands
of
professional
politicians
who
devoted
their
time
to
managing
conventions
making
platforms
nominating
candidates
and
dictating
to
officials
in
return
for
their
services
they
sold
offices
and
privileges
it
was
alleged
that
mayors
and
councils
had
bargained
away
for
private
benefit
street
railway
and
other
franchises
it
was
asserted
that
many
powerful
labor
unions
were
dominated
by
men
who
blackmailed
employers
some
critics
specialized
in
descriptions
of
the
poverty
slums
and
misery
of
great
cities
others
took
up
frenzied
finance
and
accused
financiers
of
selling
worthless
stocks
and
bonds
to
an
innocent
public
still
others
professed
to
see
in
the
accumulations
of
millionaires
the
downfall
of
our
republic
the
attack
on
invisible
government
some
even
maintained
that
the
control
of
public
affairs
had
passed
from
the
people
to  sinister
minority
called
the
invisible
government
so
eminent
and
conservative  statesman
as
the
hon
elihu
root
lent
the
weight
of
his
great
name
to
such
an
imputation
speaking
of
his
native
state
new
york
he
said
what
is
the
government
of
this
state
what
has
it
been
during
the
forty
years
of
my
acquaintance
with
it
the
government
of
the
constitution
oh
no
not
half
the
time
or
half
way
from
the
days
of
fenton
and
conkling
and
arthur
and
cornell
and
platt
from
the
days
of
david  hill
down
to
the
present
time
the
government
of
the
state
has
presented
two
different
lines
of
activity
one
of
the
constitutional
and
statutory
officers
of
the
state
and
the
other
of
the
party
leaders
they
call
them
party
bosses
they
call
the
system  don  coin
the
phrase
the
system
they
call
invisible
government
for  don  know
how
many
years
mr
conkling
was
the
supreme
ruler
in
this
state
the
governor
did
not
count
the
legislature
did
not
count
comptrollers
and
secretaries
of
state
and
what
not
did
not
count
it
was
what
mr
conkling
said
and
in  great
outburst
of
public
rage
he
was
pulled
down
then
mr
platt
ruled
the
state
for
nigh
upon
twenty
years
he
ruled
it
it
was
not
the
governor
it
was
not
the
legislature
it
was
mr
platt
and
the
capital
was
not
here
in
albany
it
was
at
broadway
mr
platt
and
his
lieutenants
it
makes
no
difference
what
name
you
give
whether
you
call
it
fenton
or
conkling
or
cornell
or
arthur
or
platt
or
by
the
names
of
men
now
living
the
ruler
of
the
state
during
the
greater
part
of
the
forty
years
of
my
acquaintance
with
the
state
government
has
not
been
any
man
authorized
by
the
constitution
or
by
law
the
party
leader
is
elected
by
no
one
accountable
to
no
one
bound
by
no
oath
of
office
removable
by
no
one
the
nation
aroused
with
the
spirit
of
criticism
came
also
the
spirit
of
reform
the
charges
were
usually
exaggerated
often
wholly
false
but
there
was
enough
truth
in
them
to
warrant
renewed
vigilance
on
the
part
of
american
democracy
president
roosevelt
doubtless
summed
up
the
sentiment
of
the
great
majority
of
citizens
when
he
demanded
the
punishment
of
wrong
doers
in
saying
it
makes
not  particle
of
difference
whether
these
crimes
are
committed
by  capitalist
or
by  laborer
by  leading
banker
or
manufacturer
or
railroad
man
or
by  leading
representative
of  labor
union
swindling
in
stocks
corrupting
legislatures
making
fortunes
by
the
inflation
of
securities
by
wrecking
railroads
by
destroying
competitors
through
rebates
these
forms
of
wrong
doing
in
the
capitalist
are
far
more
infamous
than
any
ordinary
form
of
embezzlement
or
forgery
the
time
had
come
he
added
to
stop
muckraking
and
proceed
to
the
constructive
work
of
removing
the
abuses
that
had
grown
up
political
reforms
the
public
service
it
was  wise
comprehension
of
the
needs
of
american
democracy
that
led
the
friends
of
reform
to
launch
and
to
sustain
for
more
than
half  century  movement
to
improve
the
public
service
on
the
one
side
they
struck
at
the
spoils
system
at
the
right
of
the
politicians
to
use
public
offices
as
mere
rewards
for
partisan
work
the
federal
civil
service
act
of
opened
the
way
to
reform
by
establishing
five
vital
principles
in
law
admission
to
office
not
on
the
recommendation
of
party
workers
but
on
the
basis
of
competitive
examinations
promotion
for
meritorious
service
of
the
government
rather
than
of
parties
no
assessment
of
office
holders
for
campaign
funds
permanent
tenure
during
good
behavior
and
no
dismissals
for
political
reasons
the
act
itself
at
first
applied
to
only
federal
offices
but
under
the
constant
pressure
from
the
reformers
it
was
extended
until
in
it
covered
nearly
employees

of
an
executive
force

the

well
intrenched
in
more
than
three
hundred
municipalities
in
excluding

from
public
office
the
reformers
were
in  sense
engaged
in  negative
work
that
of
keeping
the
rascals
out
but
there
was  second
and
larger
phase
to
their
movement
one
constructive
in
character
that
of
getting
skilled
loyal
and
efficient
servants
into
the
places
of
responsibility
everywhere
on
land
and
sea
in
town
and
country
new
burdens
were
laid
upon
public
officers
they
were
called
upon
to
supervise
the
ships
sailing
to
and
from
our
ports
to
inspect
the
water
and
milk
supplies
of
our
cities
to
construct
and
operate
great

such
as

those

no

at

with
the

now
said
the

we
must
make
attractive
careers
in
the

work
for
the

american
talent
we
must
train
those
applying
for
admission
and
increase
the
skill
of
those

of
trust
we
must
see
to
it
that
those
entering
at
the
bottom
have  chance
to
rise
to
the

in
short
we
must

the
australian
ballot  second
line
of
attack
on
the
political
machines
was
made
in
connection
with
the
ballot
in
the
early
days
elections
were
frequently
held
in
the
open
air
and
the
poll
was
taken
by  show
of
hands
or
by
the
enrollment
of
the
voters
under
names
of
their
favorite
candidates
when
this
ancient
practice
was
abandoned
in
favor
of
the
printed
ballot
there
was
still
no
secrecy
about
elections
each
party
prepared
its
own
ballot
often
of  distinctive
color
containing
the
names
of
its
candidates
on
election
day
these
papers
were
handed
out
to
the
voters
by
party
workers
any
one
could
tell
from
the
color
of
the
ballot
dropped
into
the
box
or
from
some
mark
on
the
outside
of
the
folded
ballot
just
how
each
man
voted
those
who
bought
votes
were
sure
that
their
purchases
were
delivered
those
who
intimidated
voters
could
know
when
their
intimidation
was
effective
in
this
way
the
party
ballot
strengthened
the
party
machine
as  remedy
for
such
abuses
reformers
learning
from
the
experience
of
australia
urged
the
adoption
of
the
australian
ballot
that
ballot
though
it
appeared
in
many
forms
had
certain
constant
features
it
was
official
that
is
furnished
by
the
government
not
by
party
workers
it
contained
the
names
of
all
candidates
of
all
parties
it
was
given
out
only
in
the
polling
places
and
it
was
marked
in
secret
the
first
state
to
introduce
it
was
massachusetts
the
year
was
before
the
end
of
the
century
it
had
been
adopted
by
nearly
all
the
states
in
the
union
the
salutary
effect
of
the
reform
in
reducing
the
amount
of
cheating
and
bribery
in
elections
was
beyond
all
question
the
direct
primary
in
connection
with
the
uprising
against
machine
politics
came  call
for
the
abolition
of
the
old
method
of
nominating
candidates
by
conventions
these
time
honored
party
assemblies
which
had
come
down
from
the
days
of
andrew
jackson
were
it
was
said
merely
conclaves
of
party
workers
sustained
by
the
spoils
system
and
dominated
by
an
inner
circle
of
bosses
the
remedy
offered
in
this
case
was
again
more
democracy
namely
the
abolition
of
the
party
convention
and
the
adoption
of
the
direct
primary
candidates
were
no
longer
to
be
chosen
by
secret
conferences
any
member
of  party
was
to
be
allowed
to
run
for
any
office
to
present
his
name
to
his
party
by
securing
signatures
to  petition
and
to
submit
his
candidacy
to
his
fellow
partisans
at  direct
primary
an
election
within
the
party
in
this
movement
governor
la
follette
of
wisconsin
took
the
lead
and
his
state
was
the
first
in
the
union
to
adopt
the
direct
primary
for
state
wide
purposes
the
idea
spread
rapidly
in
the
west
more
slowly
in
the
east
the
public
already
angered
against
the
bosses
grasped
eagerly
at
it
governor
hughes
in
new
york
pressed
it
upon
the
unwilling
legislature
state
after
state
accepted
it
until
by
rhode
island
delaware
connecticut
and
new
mexico
were
the
only
states
that
had
not
bowed
to
the
storm
still
the
results
were
disappointing
and
at
that
very
time
the
pendulum
was
beginning
to
swing
backward
popular
election
of
federal
senators
while
the
movement
for
direct
primaries
was
still
advancing
everywhere  demand
for
the
popular
election
of
senators
usually
associated
with
it
swept
forward
to
victory
under
the
original
constitution
it
had
been
expressly
provided
that
senators
should
be
chosen
by
the
legislatures
of
the
states
in
practice
this
rule
transferred
the
selection
of
senators
to
secret
caucuses
of
party
members
in
the
state
legislatures
in
connection
with
these
caucuses
there
had
been
many
scandals
some
direct
proofs
of
brazen
bribery
and
corruption
and
dark
hints
besides
the
senate
was
called
by
its
detractors  millionaires
club
and
it
was
looked
upon
as
the
citadel
of
conservatism
the
prescription
in
this
case
was
likewise
more
democracy
direct
election
of
senators
by
popular
vote
this
reform
was
not  new
idea
it
had
been
proposed
in
congress
as
early
as
president
johnson
an
ardent
advocate
made
it
the
subject
of  special
message
in
not
long
afterward
it
appeared
in
congress
at
last
in
the
year
after
the
great
populist
upheaval
the
house
of
representatives
by
the
requisite
two
thirds
vote
incorporated
it
in
an
amendment
to
the
federal
constitution
again
and
again
it
passed
the
house
but
the
senate
itself
was
obdurate
able
senators
leveled
their
batteries
against
it
mr
hoar
of
massachusetts
declared
that
it
would
transfer
the
seat
of
power
to
the
great
cities
and
masses
of
population
that
it
would
overthrow
the
whole
scheme
of
the
senate
and
in
the
end
the
whole
scheme
of
the
national
constitution
as
designed
and
established
by
the
framers
of
the
constitution
and
the
people
who
adopted
it
failing
in
the
senate
advocates
of
popular
election
made  rear
assault
through
the
states
they
induced
state
legislatures
to
enact
laws
requiring
the
nomination
of
candidates
for
the
senate
by
the
direct
primary
and
then
they
bound
the
legislatures
to
abide
by
the
popular
choice
nevada
took
the
lead
in
shortly
afterward
oregon
by
the
use
of
the
initiative
and
referendum
practically
bound
legislators
to
accept
the
popular
nominee
and
the
country
witnessed
the
spectacle
of  republican
legislature
electing  democrat
to
represent
the
state
in
the
senate
at
washington
by
three
fourths
of
the
states
had
applied
the
direct
primary
in
some
form
to
the
choice
of
senators
men
selected
by
that
method
began
to
pour
in
upon
the
floors
of
congress
finally
in
the
two
thirds
majority
was
secured
for
an
amendment
to
the
federal
constitution
providing
for
the
popular
election
of
senators
it
was
quickly
ratified
by
the
states
the
following
year
it
was
proclaimed
in
effect
the
initiative
and
referendum
as  corrective
for
the
evils
which
had
grown
up
in
state
legislatures
there
arose  demand
for
the
introduction
of  swiss
device
known
as
the
initiative
and
referendum
the
initiative
permits
any
one
to
draw
up  proposed
bill
and
on
securing  certain
number
of
signatures
among
the
voters
to
require
the
submission
of
the
measure
to
the
people
at
an
election
if
the
bill
thus
initiated
receives  sufficient
majority
it
becomes  law
the
referendum
allows
citizens
who
disapprove
any
act
passed
by
the
legislature
to
get
up  petition
against
it
and
thus
bring
about  reference
of
the
measure
to
the
voters
at
the
polls
for
approval
or
rejection
these
two
practices
constitute  form
of
direct
government
these
devices
were
prescribed
to
restore
the
government
to
the
people
the
populists
favored
them
in
their
platform
of
mr
bryan
two
years
later
made
them  part
of
his
program
and
in
the
same
year
south
dakota
adopted
them
in
oregon
after  strenuous
campaign
added  direct
legislation
amendment
to
the
state
constitution
within
ten
years
all
the
southwestern
mountain
and
pacific
states
except
texas
and
wyoming
had
followed
this
example
to
the
east
of
the
mississippi
however
direct
legislation
met  chilly
reception
by
only
five
states
in
this
section
had
accepted
it
maine
massachusetts
ohio
michigan
and
maryland
the
last
approving
the
referendum
only
the
recall
executive
officers
and
judges
as
well
as
legislatures
had
come
in
for
their
share
of
criticism
and
it
was
proposed
that
they
should
likewise
be
subjected
to  closer
scrutiny
by
the
public
for
this
purpose
there
was
advanced  scheme
known
as
the
recall
which
permitted  certain
percentage
of
the
voters
to
compel
any
officer
at
any
time
during
his
term
to
go
before
the
people
at  new
election
this
feature
of
direct
government
tried
out
first
in
the
city
of
los
angeles
was
extended
to
state
wide
uses
in
oregon
in
it
failed
however
to
capture
popular
imagination
to
the
same
degree
as
the
initiative
and
referendum
at
the
end
of
ten
years
agitation
only
ten
states
mainly
in
the
west
had
adopted
it
for
general
purposes
and
four
of
them
did
not
apply
it
to
the
judges
of
the
courts
still
it
was
extensively
acclaimed
in
cities
and
incorporated
into
hundreds
of
municipal
laws
and
charters
as  general
proposition
direct
government
in
all
its
forms
was
bitterly
opposed
by
men
of  conservative
cast
of
mind
it
was
denounced
by
senator
henry
cabot
lodge
as
nothing
less
than  complete
revolution
in
the
fabric
of
our
government
and
in
the
fundamental
principles
upon
which
that
government
rests
in
his
opinion
it
promised
to
break
down
the
representative
principle
and
undermine
and
overthrow
the
bulwarks
of
ordered
liberty
and
individual
freedom
mr
taft
shared
mr
lodge  views
and
spoke
of
direct
government
with
scorn
votes
he
exclaimed
are
not
bread
referendums
do
not
pay
rent
or
furnish
houses
recalls
do
not
furnish
clothes
initiatives
do
not
supply

commission
government
for
cities
in
the
restless
searching
out
of
evils
the
management
of
cities
early
came
under
critical
scrutiny
city
government
mr
bryce
had
remarked
was
the
one
conspicuous
failure
in
america
this
sharp
thrust
though
resented
by
some
was
accepted
as  warning
by
others
many
prescriptions
were
offered
by
doctors
of
the
body
politic
chief
among
them
was
the
idea
of
simplifying
the
city
government
so
that
the
light
of
public
scrutiny
could
shine
through
it
let
us
elect
only  few
men
and
make
them
clearly
responsible
for
the
city
government
was
the
new
cry
in
municipal
reform
so
many
city
councils
were
reduced
in
size
one
of
the
two
houses
which
several
cities
had
adopted
in
imitation
of
the
federal
government
was
abolished
and
in
order
that
the
mayor
could
be
held
to
account
he
was
given
the
power
to
appoint
all
the
chief
officials
this
made
the
mayor
in
some
cases
the
only
elective
city
official
and
gave
the
voters  short
ballot
containing
only  few
names
an
idea
which
some
proposed
to
apply
also
to
the
state
government  further
step
in
the
concentration
of
authority
was
taken
in
galveston
texas
where
the
people
looking
upon
the
ruin
of
their
city
wrought
by
the
devastating
storm
of
and
confronted
by
the
difficult
problems
of
reconstruction
felt
the
necessity
for  more
businesslike
management
of
city
affairs
and
instituted  new
form
of
local
administration
they
abolished
the
old
scheme
of
mayor
and
council
and
vested
all
power
in
five
commissioners
one
of
whom
without
any
special
prerogatives
was
assigned
to
the
office
of
mayor
president
in
the
commission
form
of
government
as
it
was
soon
characterized
was
adopted
by
des
moines
iowa
the
attention
of
all
municipal
reformers
was
drawn
to
it
and
it
was
hailed
as
the
guarantee
of  better
day
by
more
than
four
hundred
cities
including
memphis
spokane
birmingham
newark
and
buffalo
had
adopted
it
still
the
larger
cities
like
new
york
and
chicago
kept
their
boards
of
aldermen
the
city
manager
plan  few
years
experience
with
commission
government
revealed
certain
patent
defects
the
division
of
the
work
among
five
men
was
frequently
found
to
introduce
dissensions
and
irresponsibility
commissioners
were
often
lacking
in
the
technical
ability
required
to
manage
such
difficult
matters
as
fire
and
police
protection
public
health
public
works
and
public
utilities
some
one
then
proposed
to
carry
over
into
city
government
an
idea
from
the
business
world
in
that
sphere
the
stockholders
of
each
corporation
elect
the
directors
and
the
directors
in
turn
choose  business
manager
to
conduct
the
affairs
of
the
company
it
was
suggested
that
the
city
commissioners
instead
of
attempting
to
supervise
the
details
of
the
city
administration
should
select  manager
to
do
this
the
scheme
was
put
into
effect
in
sumter
south
carolina
in
like
the
commission
plan
it
became
popular
within
eight
years
more
than
one
hundred
and
fifty
towns
and
cities
had
adopted
it
among
the
larger
municipalities
were
dayton
springfield
ohio
akron
kalamazoo
and
phoenix
it
promised
to
create  new
public
service
profession
that
of
city
manager
measures
of
economic
reform
the
spirit
of
american
reform
the
purification
of
the
ballot
the
restriction
of
the
spoils
system
the
enlargement
of
direct
popular
control
over
the
organs
of
government
were
not
the
sole
answers
made
by
the
reformers
to
the
critics
of
american
institutions
nor
were
they
the
most
important
in
fact
they
were
regarded
not
as
ends
in
themselves
but
as
means
to
serve  wider
purpose
that
purpose
was
the
promotion
of
the
general
welfare
the
concrete
objects
covered
by
that
broad
term
were
many
and
varied
but
they
included
the
prevention
of
extortion
by
railway
and
other
corporations
the
protection
of
public
health
the
extension
of
education
the
improvement
of
living
conditions
in
the
cities
the
elimination
of
undeserved
poverty
the
removal
of
gross
inequalities
in
wealth
and
more
equality
of
opportunity
all
these
things
involved
the
use
of
the
powers
of
government
although  few
clung
to
the
ancient
doctrine
that
the
government
should
not
interfere
with
private
business
at
all
the
american
people
at
large
rejected
that
theory
as
vigorously
as
they
rejected
the
doctrines
of
an
extreme
socialism
which
exalts
the
state
above
the
individual
leaders
representing
every
shade
of
opinion
proclaimed
the
government
an
instrument
of
common
welfare
to
be
used
in
the
public
interest
we
must
abandon
definitely
said
roosevelt
the
laissez
faire
theory
of
political
economy
and
fearlessly
champion  system
of
increased
governmental
control
paying
no
attention
to
the
cries
of
worthy
people
who
denounce
this
as
socialistic
this
view
was
shared
by
mr
taft
who
observed
undoubtedly
the
government
can
wisely
do
much
more
to
relieve
the
oppressed
to
create
greater
equality
of
opportunity
to
make
reasonable
terms
for
labor
in
employment
and
to
furnish
vocational
education
he
was
quick
to
add
his
caution
that
there
is  line
beyond
which
the
government
cannot
go
with
any
good
practical
results
in
seeking
to
make
men
and
society
better
the
regulation
of
railways
the
first
attempts
to
use
the
government
in  large
way
to
control
private
enterprise
in
the
public
interest
were
made
by
the
northwestern
states
in
the
decade
between
and
charges
were
advanced
by
the
farmers
particularly
those
organized
into
granges
that
the
railways
extorted
the
highest
possible
rates
for
freight
and
passengers
that
favoritism
was
shown
to
large
shippers
that
fraudulent
stocks
and
bonds
were
sold
to
the
innocent
public
it
was
claimed
that
railways
were
not
like
other
enterprises
but
were
quasi
public
concerns
like
the
roads
and
ferries
and
thus
subject
to
government
control
accordingly
laws
were
enacted
bringing
the
railroads
under
state
supervision
in
some
cases
the
state
legislature
fixed
the
maximum
rates
to
be
charged
by
common
carriers
and
in
other
cases
commissions
were
created
with
the
power
to
establish
the
rates
after
an
investigation
this
legislation
was
at
first
denounced
in
the
east
as
nothing
less
than
the
confiscation
of
the
railways
in
the
interest
of
the
farmers
attempts
to
have
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
declare
it
unconstitutional
were
made
without
avail
still  principle
was
finally
laid
down
to
the
effect
that
in
fixing
rates
state
legislatures
and
commissions
must
permit
railway
companies
to
earn  fair
return
on
the
capital
invested
in  few
years
the
granger
spirit
appeared
in
congress
an
investigation
revealed  long
list
of
abuses
committed
by
the
railways
against
shippers
and
travelers
the
result
was
the
interstate
commerce
act
of
which
created
the
interstate
commerce
commission
forbade
discriminations
in
rates
and
prohibited
other
objectionable
practices
on
the
part
of
railways
this
measure
was
loosely
enforced
and
the
abuses
against
which
it
was
directed
continued
almost
unabated  demand
for
stricter
control
grew
louder
and
louder
congress
was
forced
to
heed
in
it
enacted
the
elkins
law
forbidding
railways
to
charge
rates
other
than
those
published
and
laid
penalties
upon
the
officers
and
agents
of
companies
who
granted
secret
favors
to
shippers
and
upon
shippers
who
accepted
them
three
years
later  still
more
drastic
step
was
taken
by
the
passage
of
the
hepburn
act
the
interstate
commerce
commission
was
authorized
upon
complaint
of
some
party
aggrieved
and
after  public
hearing
to
determine
whether
just
and
reasonable
rates
had
been
charged
by
the
companies
in
effect
the
right
to
fix
freight
and
passenger
rates
was
taken
out
of
the
hands
of
the
owners
of
the
railways
engaged
in
interstate
commerce
and
vested
in
the
hands
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
thus
private
property
to
the
value
of
or
more
was
declared
to
be  matter
of
public
concern
and
subject
to
government
regulation
in
the
common
interest
municipal
utilities
similar
problems
arose
in
connection
with
the
street
railways
electric
light
plants
and
other
utilities
in
the
great
cities
in
the
beginning
the
right
to
construct
such
undertakings
was
freely
and
often
corruptly
granted
to
private
companies
by
city
councils
distressing
abuses
arose
in
connection
with
such
practices
many
grants
or
franchises
were
made
perpetual
or
perhaps
for  term
of
years
the
rates
charged
and
services
rendered
were
left
largely
to
the
will
of
the
companies
holding
the
franchises
mergers
or
unions
of
companies
were
common
and
the
public
was
deluged
with
stocks
and
bonds
of
doubtful
value
bankruptcies
were
frequent
the
connection
between
the
utility
companies
and
the
politicians
was
to
say
the
least
not
always
in
the
public
interest
american
ingenuity
was
quick
to
devise
methods
for
eliminating
such
evils
three
lines
of
progress
were
laid
out
by
the
reformers
one
group
proposed
that
such
utilities
should
be
subject
to
municipal
or
state
regulation
that
the
formation
of
utility
companies
should
be
under
public
control
and
that
the
issue
of
stocks
and
bonds
must
be
approved
by
public
authority
in
some
cases
state
and
in
other
cases
municipal
commissions
were
created
to
exercise
this
great
power
over
quasi
public
corporations
wisconsin
by
laws
enacted
in
put
all
heat
light
water
works
telephone
and
street
railway
companies
under
the
supervision
of  single
railway
commission
other
states
followed
this
example
rapidly
by
the
principle
of
public
control
over
municipal
utilities
was
accepted
in
nearly
every
section
of
the
union  second
line
of
reform
appeared
in
the
model
franchise
for
utility
corporations
an
illustration
of
this
tendency
was
afforded
by
the
chicago
street
railway
settlement
of
the
total
capital
of
the
company
was
fixed
at  definite
sum
its
earnings
were
agreed
upon
and
the
city
was
given
the
right
to
buy
and
operate
the
system
if
it
desired
to
do
so
in
many
states
about
the
same
time
it
was
provided
that
no
franchises
to
utility
companies
could
run
more
than
twenty
five
years  third
group
of
reformers
were
satisfied
with
nothing
short
of
municipal
ownership
they
proposed
to
drive
private
companies
entirely
out
of
the
field
and
vest
the
ownership
and
management
of
municipal
plants
in
the
city
itself
this
idea
was
extensively
applied
to
electric
light
and
water
works
plants
but
to
street
railways
in
only  few
cities
including
san
francisco
and
seattle
in
new
york
the
subways
are
owned
by
the
city
but
leased
for
operation
tenement
house
control
among
the
other
pressing
problems
of
the
cities
was
the
overcrowding
in
houses
unfit
for
habitation
an
inquiry
in
new
york
city
made
under
the
authority
of
the
state
in
revealed
poverty
misery
slums
dirt
and
disease
almost
beyond
imagination
the
immediate
answer
was
the
enactment
of  tenement
house
law
prescribing
in
great
detail
the
size
of
the
rooms
the
air
space
the
light
and
the
sanitary
arrangement
for
all
new
buildings
an
immense
improvement
followed
and
the
idea
was
quickly
taken
up
in
other
states
having
large
industrial
centers
in
new
york
made  further
invasion
of
the
rights
of
landlords
by
assuring
to
the
public
reasonable
rents
for
flats
and
apartments
workmen  compensation
no
small
part
of
the
poverty
in
cities
was
due
to
the
injury
of
wage
earners
while
at
their
trade
every
year
the
number
of
men
and
women
killed
or
wounded
in
industry
mounted
higher
under
the
old
law
the
workman
or
his
family
had
to
bear
the
loss
unless
the
employer
had
been
guilty
of
some
extraordinary
negligence
even
in
that
case
an
expensive
lawsuit
was
usually
necessary
to
recover
damages
in
short
although
employers
insured
their
buildings
and
machinery
against
necessary
risks
from
fire
and
storm
they
allowed
their
employees
to
assume
the
heavy
losses
due
to
accidents
the
injustice
of
this
though
apparent
enough
now
was
once
not
generally
recognized
it
was
said
to
be
unfair
to
make
the
employer
pay
for
injuries
for
which
he
was
not
personally
responsible
but
the
argument
was
overborne
illustration
an
east
side
street
in
new
york
about
there
set
in  decided
movement
in
the
direction
of
lifting
the
burden
of
accidents
from
the
unfortunate
victims
in
the
first
place
laws
were
enacted
requiring
employers
to
pay
damages
in
certain
amounts
according
to
the
nature
of
the
case
no
matter
how
the
accident
occurred
as
long
as
the
injured
person
was
not
guilty
of
willful
negligence
by
more
than
one
half
the
states
had
such
laws
in
the
second
place
there
developed
schemes
of
industrial
insurance
in
the
form
of
automatic
grants
made
by
state
commissions
to
persons
injured
in
industries
the
funds

be

by
the

or
the
state
or
by
both
by
thirty
six
states
had
legislation
of
this
type
minimum
wages
and
mothers
pensions
another
source
of
poverty
especially
among
women
and
children
was
found
to
be
the
low
wages
paid
for
their
labor
report
after
report
showed
this
in
massachusetts
took  significant
step
in
the
direction
of
declaring
the
minimum
wages
which
might
be
paid
to
women
and
children
oregon
the
following
year
created  commission
with
power
to
prescribe
minimum
wages
in
certain
industries
based
on
the
cost
of
living
and
to
enforce
the
rates
fixed
within  short
time
one
third
of
the
states
had
legislation
of
this
character
to
cut
away
some
of
the
evils
of
poverty
and
enable
widows
to
keep
their
homes
intact
and
bring
up
their
children  device
known
as
mothers
pensions
became
popular
during
the
second
decade
of
the
twentieth
century
at
the
opening
of
two
states
colorado
and
illinois
had
laws
authorizing
the
payment
from
public
funds
of
definite
sums
to
widows
with
children
within
four
years
thirty
five
states
had
similar
legislation
taxation
and
great
fortunes
as  part
of
the
campaign
waged
against
poverty
by
reformers
there
came  demand
for
heavy
taxes
upon
great
fortunes
particularly
taxes
upon
inheritances
or
estates
passing
to
heirs
on
the
decease
of
the
owners
roosevelt
was
an
ardent
champion
of
this
type
of
taxation
and
dwelt
upon
it
at
length
in
his
message
to
congress
in
such  tax
he
said
would
help
to
preserve  measurable
equality
of
opportunity
for
the
people
of
the
generations
growing
to
manhood
our
aim
is
to
recognize
what
lincoln
pointed
out
the
fact
that
there
are
some
respects
in
which
men
are
obviously
not
equal
but
also
to
insist
that
there
should
be
equality
of
self
respect
and
of
mutual
respect
an
equality
of
rights
before
the
law
and
at
least
an
approximate
equality
in
the
conditions
under
which
each
man
obtains
the
chance
to
show
the
stuff
that
is
in
him
when
compared
with
his
fellows
the
spirit
of
the
new
age
was
therefore
one
of
reform
not
of
revolution
it
called
for
no
evolutionary
or
utopian
experiments
but
for
the
steady
and
progressive
enactment
of
measures

and
was
promoted
by
their
organizations
where
they
did
not
lead
they
were
affiliated
with
movements
for
social
improvement
no
cause
escaped
their
attention
no
year
passed
without
widening
the
range
of
their
interests
they
served
on
committees
that
inquired
into
the
problems
of
the
day
they
appeared
before
legislative
assemblies
to
advocate
remedies
for
the
evils
they
discovered
by
they
were  force
to
be
reckoned
with
in
national
politics
in
nine
states
complete
and
equal
suffrage
had
been
established
and  widespread
campaign
for  national
suffrage
amendment
was
in
full
swing
on
every
hand
lay
evidences
that
their
sphere
had
been
broadened
to
include
public
affairs
this
was
the
culmination
of
forces
that
had
long
been
operating  new
emphasis
in
history  movement
so
deeply
affecting
important
interests
could
not
fail
to
find  place
in
time
in
the
written
record
of
human
progress
history
often
began
as  chronicle
of
kings
and
queens
knights
and
ladies
written
partly
to
amuse
and
partly
to
instruct
the
classes
that
appeared
in
its
pages
with
the
growth
of
commerce
parliaments
and
international
relations
politics
and
diplomacy
were
added
to
such
chronicles
of
royal
and
princely
doings
after
the
rise
of
democracy
industry
and
organized
labor
the
transactions
of
everyday
life
were
deemed
worthy
of  place
in
the
pages
of
history
in
each
case
history
was
rewritten
and
the
past
rediscovered
in
the
light
of
the
new
age
so
it
will
be
with
the
rise
and
growth
of
women  political
power
the
history
of
their
labor
their
education
their
status
in
society
their
influence
on
the
course
of
events
will
be
explored
and
given
its
place
in
the
general
record
it
will
be  history
of
change
the
superior
position
which
women
enjoy
in
america
to
day
is
the
result
of  slow
evolution
from
an
almost
rightless
condition
in
colonial
times
the
founders
of
america
brought
with
them
the
english
common
law
under
that
law  married
woman  personal
property
jewels
money
furniture
and
the
like
became
her
husband  property
the
management
of
her
lands
passed
into
his
control
even
the
wages
she
earned
if
she
worked
for
some
one
else
belonged
to
him
custom
if
not
law
prescribed
that
women
should
not
take
part
in
town
meetings
or
enter
into
public
discussions
of
religious
questions
indeed
it
is  far
cry
from
the
banishment
of
anne
hutchinson
from
massachusetts
in
for
daring
to
dispute
with
the
church
fathers
to
the
political
conventions
of
in
which
women
sat
as
delegates
made
nominating
speeches
and
served
on
committees
in
the
contrast
between
these
two
scenes
may
be
measured
the
change
in
the
privileges
of
women
since
the
landing
of
the
pilgrims
the
account
of
this
progress
is  narrative
of
individual
effort
on
the
part
of
women
of
organizations
among
them
of
generous
aid
from
sympathetic
men
in
the
long
agitation
for
the
removal
of
civil
and
political
disabilities
it
is
in
part
also  narrative
of
irresistible
economic
change
which
drew
women
into
industry
created  leisure
class
gave
women
wages
and
incomes
and
therewith
economic
independence
the
rise
of
the
woman
movement
protests
of
colonial
women
the
republican
spirit
which
produced
american
independence
was
of
slow
and
steady
growth
it
did
not
spring
up
full
armed
in  single
night
it
was
on
the
contrary
nourished
during  long
period
of
time
by
fireside
discussions
as
well
as
by
debates
in
the
public
forum
women
shared
that
fireside
sifting
of
political
principles
and
passed
on
the
findings
of
that
scrutiny
in
letters
to
their
friends
newspaper
articles
and
every
form
of
written
word
how
widespread
was
this
potent
though
not
spectacular
force
is
revealed
in
the
collections
of
women  letters
articles
songs
dramas
and
satirical
skits
on
english
rule
that
have
come
down
to
us
in
this
search
into
the
reasons
of
government
some
women
began
to
take
thought
about
laws
that
excluded
them
from
the
ballot
two
women
at
least
left
their
protests
on
record
abigail
the
ingenious
and
witty
wife
of
john
adams
wrote
to
her
husband
in
march
that
women
objected
to
all
arbitrary
power
whether
of
state
or
males
and
demanded
political
privileges
in
the
new
order
then
being
created
hannah

the
stir
among
european
women
ferment
in
america
in
the
case
of
women
as
of
men
was
quickened
by
events
in

in
mary
wollstonecraft
published
in
england
the
vindication
of
the
rights
of
women  book
that
was
destined
to
serve
the
cause
of
liberty
among
women
as
the
writings
of
locke
and
paine
had
served
that
of
men
the
specific
grievances
which
stirred
english
women
were
men  invasion
of
women  industries
such
as
spinning
and
weaving
the
denial
of
equal
educational
opportunities
and
political
disabilities
in
france
also
the
great
revolution
raised
questionings
about
the
status
of
women
the
rights
of
citizenesses
as
well
as
the
rights
of
citizens
were
examined
by
the
boldest
thinkers
this
in
turn
reacted
upon
women
in
the
united
states
leadership
in
america
the
origins
of
the
american
woman
movement
are
to
be
found
in
the
writings
of  few
early
intellectual
leaders
during
the
first
decades
of
the
nineteenth
century
books
articles
and
pamphlets
about
women
came
in
increasing
numbers
from
the
press
lydia

margaret
fuller
made  critical
examination
of
the
status
of
women
in
her
time
and
mrs
elizabeth

supplemented
the
older
histories
by
showing
what
an
important
part
women
had
played
in
the
american
revolution
the
struggle
for
education
along
with
criticism
there
was
carried
on  constructive
struggle
for
better
educational
facilities
for
women
who
had
been
from
the
beginning
excluded
from
every
college
in
the
country
in
this
long
battle
emma

for
equal
educational
opportunities
which
helped
to
bear
fruit
in
the
founding
of
vassar
college
shortly
after
the
civil
war
the
desire
to
effect
reforms
as
they
came
to
study
their
own
history
and
their
own
part
in
civilization
women
naturally
became
deeply
interested
in
all
the
controversies
going
on
around
them
the
temperance
question
made  special
appeal
to
them
and
they
organized
to
demand
the
right
to
be
heard
on
it
in
the
daughters
of
temperance
formed  secret
society
favoring
prohibition
they
dared
to
criticize
the
churches
for
their
indifference
and
were
so
bold
as
to
ask
that
drunkenness
be
made  ground
for
divorce
the
slavery
issue
even
more
than
temperance
called
women
into
public
life
the
grimke
sisters
of
south
carolina
emancipated
their
bondmen
and
one
of
these
sisters
exiled
from

for
her
appeal

north
to
work

delegates
represented
eight
states
three
years
later
eight
american
women
five
of
them
in
quaker
costume
attended
the
world
anti
slavery
convention
in
london
much
to
the
horror
of
the
men
who
promptly
excluded
them
from
the
sessions
on
the
ground
that
it
was
not
fitting
for
women
to
take
part
in
such
meetings
in
other
spheres
of
activity
especially
social
service
women
steadily
enlarged
their
interest
nothing
human
did
they
consider
alien
to
them
they
inveighed
against
cruel
criminal
laws
and
unsanitary
prisons
they
organized
poor
relief
and
led
in
private
philanthropy
dorothea
dix
directed
the
movement
that
induced
the
new

legislature
to
establish

asylum
for
the
criminal
insane
in
the

year
sarah

throughout

there
were
misery
and
suffering
women
were
preparing
programs
of
relief
freedom
of
speech
for
women
in
the
advancement
of
their
causes
of
whatever
kind
women
of
necessity
had
to
make
public
appeals
and
take
part
in
open
meetings
here
they
encountered
difficulties
the
appearance
of
women
on
the
platform
was
new
and
strange
naturally
it
was
widely
resented
antoinette
brown
although
she
had
credentials
as  delegate
was
driven
off
the
platform
of  temperance
convention
in
new
york
city
simply
because
she
was  woman
james
russell
lowell
editor
of
the
atlantic
monthly
declined  poem
from
julia
ward
howe
on
the
theory
that
no
woman
could
write  poem
but
he
added
on
second
thought
that
he
might
consider
an
article
in
prose
nathaniel
hawthorne
another
editor
even
objected
to
something
in
prose
because
to
him
all
ink
stained
women
were
equally
detestable
to
the
natural
resentment
against
their
intrusion
into
new
fields
was
added
that
aroused
by
their
ideas
and
methods
as
temperance
reformers
they
criticized
in  caustic
manner
those
who
would
not
accept
their
opinions
as
opponents
of
slavery
they
were
especially
bitter
one
of
their
conventions
held
at
philadelphia
in
passed  resolution
calling
on
all
women
to
leave
those
churches
that
would
not
condemn
every
form
of
human
bondage
this
stirred
against
them
many
of
the
clergy
who
accustomed
to
having
women
sit
silent
during
services
were
in
no
mood
to
treat
such  revolt
leniently
then
came
the
last
straw
women
decided
that
they
would
preach
out
of
the
pulpit
first
and
finally
in
it
women
in
industry
the
period
of
this
ferment
was
also
the
age
of
the
industrial
revolution
in
america
the
rise
of
the
factory
system
and
the
growth
of
mill
towns
the
labor
of
women
was
transferred
from
the
homes
to
the
factories
then
arose
many
questions
the
hours
of
labor
the
sanitary
conditions
of
the
mills
the
pressure
of
foreign
immigration
on
native
labor
the
wages
of
women
as
compared
with
those
of
men
and
the
right
of
married
women
to
their
own
earnings
labor
organizations
sprang
up
among
working
women
the
mill
girls
of
lowell
massachusetts
mainly
the
daughters
of
new
england
farmers
published  magazine
the
lowell
offering
so
excellent
were
their
writings
that
the
french
statesman
thiers
carried  copy
of
their
paper
into
the
chamber
of
deputies
to
show
what
working
women
could
achieve
in  republic
as
women
were
now
admittedly
earning
their
own
way
in
the
world
by
their
own
labor
they
began
to
talk
of
their
economic
independence
the
world
shaken
by
revolution
such
was
the
quickening
of
women  minds
in
when
the
world
was
startled
once
more
by  revolution
in
france
which
spread
to
germany
poland
austria
hungary
and
italy
once
more
the
people
of
the
earth
began
to
explore
the
principles
of
democracy
and
expound
human
rights
women
now
better
educated
and
more
advanced
in
their
ideas
played  role
of
still
greater
importance
in
that
revolution
they
led
in
agitations
and
uprisings
they
suffered
from
reaction
and
persecution
from
their
prison
in
france
two
of
them
who
had
been
jailed
for
too
much
insistence
on
women  rights
exchanged
greetings
with
american
women
who
were
raising
the
same
issue
here
by
this
time
the
women
had
more
supporters
among
the
men
horace
greeley
editor
of
the
new
york
tribune
though
he
afterwards
recanted
used
his
powerful
pen
in
their
behalf
anti
slavery
leaders
welcomed
their
aid
and
repaid
them
by
urging
the
enfranchisement
of
women
the
woman  rights
convention
of
the
forces
moral
and
intellectual
which
had
been
stirring
among
women
crystallized  few
months
after
the
outbreak
of
the
european
revolution
in
the
first
woman  rights
convention
in
the
history
of
america
it
met
at
seneca
falls
new
york
in
on
the
call
of
lucretia
mott
martha
wright
elizabeth
cady
stanton
and
mary
ann
mcclintock
three
of
them
quakers
accustomed
to
take
part
in
church
meetings
with
men
the
quakers
naturally
suggested
that
men
as
well
as
women
be
invited
to
attend
the
convention
indeed  man
presided
over
the
conference
for
that
position
seemed
too
presumptuous
even
for
such
stout
advocates
of
woman  rights
the
deliberations
of
the
seneca
falls
convention
resulted
in  declaration
of
rights
modeled
after
the
declaration
of
independence
for
example
the
preamble
began
when
in
the
course
of
human
events
it
becomes
necessary
for
one
portion
of
the
family
of
man
to
assume
among
the
people
of
the
earth  position
different
from
that
which
they
have
hitherto
occupied
so
also
it
closed
such
has
been
the
patient
suffering
of
women
under
this
government
and
such
is
now
the
necessity
which
constrains
them
to
demand
the
equal
station
to
which
they
are
entitled
then
followed
the
list
of
grievances
the
same
number
which
had
been
exhibited
to
george
iii
in
especially
did
they
assail
the
disabilities
imposed
upon
them
by
the
english
common
law
imported
into
america
the
law
which
denied
married
women
their
property
their
wages
and
their
legal
existence
as
separate
persons
all
these
grievances
they
recited
to  candid
world
the
remedies
for
the
evils
which
they
endured
were
then
set
forth
in
detail
they
demanded
equal
rights
in
the
colleges
trades
and
professions
equal
suffrage
the
right
to
share
in
all
political
offices
honors
and
emoluments
the
right
to
complete
equality
in
marriage
including
equal
guardianship
of
the
children
and
for
married
women
the
right
to
own
property
to
keep
wages
to
make
contracts
to
transact
business
and
to
testify
in
the
courts
of
justice
in
short
they
declared
women
to
be
persons
as
men
are
persons
and
entitled
to
all
the
rights
and
privileges
of
human
beings
such
was
the
clarion
call
which
went
forth
to
the
world
in
to
an
amused
and
contemptuous
world
it
must
be
admitted
but
to  world
fated
to
heed
and
obey
the
first
gains
in
civil
liberty
the
convention
of
did
not
make
political
enfranchisement
the
leading
issue
rather
did
it
emphasize
the
civil
disabilities
of
women
which
were
most
seriously
under
discussion
at
the
time
indeed
the
new
york
legislature
of
that
very
year
as
the
result
of  twelve
years
agitation
passed
the
married
woman  property
act
setting
aside
the
general
principles
of
the
english
common
law
as
applied
to
women
and
giving
them
many
of
the
rights
of
man
california
and
wisconsin
followed
in
massachusetts
in
and
kansas
in
other
states
soon
fell
into
line
women  earnings
and
inheritances
were
at
last
their
own
in
some
states
at
least
in  little
while
laws
were
passed
granting
women
rights
as
equal
guardians
of
their
children
and
permitting
them
to
divorce
their
husbands
on
the
grounds
of
cruelty
and
drunkenness
by
degrees
other
steps
were
taken
the
woman  medical
college
of
pennsylvania
was
founded
in
and
the
philadelphia
school
of
design
for
women
three
years
later
in
the
american
women  educational
association
was
formed
to
initiate
an
agitation
for
enlarged
educational
opportunities
for
women
other
colleges
soon
emulated
the
example
of
oberlin
the
university
of
utah
in
hillsdale
college
in
michigan
in
baker
university
in
kansas
in
and
the
university
of
iowa
in
new
trades
and
professions
were
opened
to
women
and
old
prejudices
against
their
activities
and
demands
slowly
gave
way
the
national
struggle
for
woman
suffrage
the
beginnings
of
organization
as
women
surmounted
one
obstacle
after
another
the
agitation
for
equal
suffrage
came
to
the
front
if
any
year
is
to
be
fixed
as
the
date
of
its
beginning
it
may
very
well
be
when
the
suffragists
of
ohio
urged
the
state
constitutional
convention
to
confer
the
vote
upon
them
with
apparent
spontaneity
there
were
held
in
the
same
year
state
suffrage
conferences
in
indiana
pennsylvania
and
massachusetts
and
connections
were
formed
among
the
leaders
of
these
meetings
at
the
same
time
the
first
national
suffrage
convention
was
held
in
worcester
massachusetts
on
the
call
of
eighty
nine
leading
men
and
women
representing
six
states
accounts
of
the
convention
were
widely
circulated
in
this
country
and
abroad
english
women
for
instance
harriet
martineau
sent
words
of
appreciation
for
the
work
thus
inaugurated
it
inspired  leading
article
in
the
westminster
review
which
deeply
interested
the
distinguished

soon
he
was
the
champion
of
woman
suffrage
in
the
british
parliament
and
the
author
of  powerful
tract
the
subjection
of
women
widely
read
throughout
the
english
speaking
world
thus
do
world
movements
grow
strange
to
relate
the
women
of
england
were
enfranchised
before
the
adoption
of
the
federal
suffrage
amendment
in
america
the
national
suffrage
convention
of
was
followed
by
an
extraordinary
outburst
of
agitation
pamphlets
streamed
from
the
press
petitions
to
legislative
bodies
were
drafted
signed
and
presented
there
were
addresses
by
favorite
orators
like
garrison
phillips
and
curtis
and
lectures
and
poems
by
men
like
emerson
longfellow
and
whittier
in
the
first
suffrage
paper
was
founded
by
the
wife
of  member
of
congress
from
rhode
island
by
this
time
the
last
barrier
to
white
manhood
suffrage
in
the
north
had
been
swept
away
and
the
woman  movement
was
gaining
momentum
every
year
the
suffrage
movement
checked
by
the
civil
war
advocates
of
woman
suffrage
believed
themselves
on
the
high
road
to
success
when
the
civil
war
engaged
the
energies
and
labors
of
the
nation
northern
women
became
absorbed
in
the
struggle
to
preserve
the
union
they
held
no
suffrage
conventions
for
five
years
they
transformed
their
associations
into
loyalty
leagues
they
banded
together
to
buy
only
domestic
goods
when
foreign
imports
threatened
to
ruin
american
markets
they
rolled
up
monster
petitions
in
favor
of
the
emancipation
of
slaves
in
hospitals
in
military
prisons
in
agriculture
and
in
industry
they
bore
their
full
share
of
responsibility
even
when
the
new
york
legislature
took
advantage
of
their
unguarded
moments
and
repealed
the
law
giving
the
mother
equal
rights
with
the
father
in
the
guardianship
of
children
they
refused
to
lay
aside
war
work
for
agitation
as
in
all
other
wars
their
devotion
was
unstinted
and
their
sacrifices
equal
to
the
necessities
of
the
hour
the
federal
suffrage
amendment
their
plans
and
activities
when
the
war
closed
were
shaped
by
events
beyond
their
control
the
emancipation
of
the
slaves
and
their
proposed
enfranchisement
made
prominent
the
question
of  national
suffrage
for
the
first
time
in
our
history
friends
of
the
colored
man
insisted
that
his
civil
liberties
would
not
be
safe
unless
he
was
granted
the
right
to
vote
the
woman
suffragists
very
pertinently
asked
why
the
same
principle
did
not
apply
to
women
the
answer
which
they
received
was
negative
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
the
federal
constitution
adopted
in
definitely
put
women
aside
by
limiting
the
scope
of
its
application
so
far
as
the
suffrage
was
concerned
to
the
male
sex
in
making
manhood
suffrage
national
however
it
nationalized
the
issue
this
was
the
signal
for
the
advocates
of
woman
suffrage
in
march
their
proposed
amendment
was
introduced
in
congress
by
george  julian
of
indiana
it
provided
that
no
citizen
should
be
deprived
of
the
vote
on
account
of
sex
following
the
language
of
the
fifteenth
amendment
which
forbade
disfranchisement
on
account
of
race
support
for
the
amendment
coming
from
many
directions
led
the
suffragists
to
believe
that
their
case
was
hopeful
in
their
platform
of
for
example
the
republicans
praised
the
women
for
their
loyal
devotion
to
freedom
welcomed
them
to
spheres
of
wider
usefulness
and
declared
that
the
demand
of
any
class
of
citizens
for
additional
rights
deserved
respectful
consideration

experience
soon
demonstrated
however
that
praise
was
not
the
ballot
indeed
the
suffragists
already
had
realized
that  tedious
contest
lay
before
them
they
had
revived
in
their
regular
national
convention
they
gave
the
name
of
the
revolution
to
their
paper
edited
by
elizabeth
cady
stanton
and
susan  anthony
they
formed  national
suffrage
association
and
organized
annual
pilgrimages
to
congress
to
present
their
claims
such
activities
bore
some
results
many
eminent
congressmen
were
converted
to
their
cause
and
presented
it
ably
to
their
colleagues
of
both
chambers
still
the
subject
was
ridiculed
by
the
newspapers
and
looked
upon
as
freakish
by
the
masses
the
state
campaigns
discouraged
by
the
outcome
of
the
national
campaign
suffragists
turned
to
the
voters
of
the
individual
states
and
sought
the
ballot
at
their
hands
gains
by
this
process
were
painfully
slow
wyoming
it
is
true
while
still  territory
granted
suffrage
to
women
in
and
continued
it
on
becoming  state
twenty
years
later
in
spite
of
strong
protests
in
congress
in
colorado
established
complete
political
equality
in
utah
the
third
suffrage
state
the
cause
suffered
many
vicissitudes
women
were
enfranchised
by
the
territorial
legislature
they
were
deprived
of
the
ballot
by
congress
in
finally
in
on
the
admission
of
utah
to
the
union
they
recovered
their
former
rights
during
the
same
year
idaho
conferred
equal
suffrage
upon
the
women
this
was
the
last
suffrage
victory
for
more
than  decade
the
suffrage
cause
in
congress
in
the
midst
of
the
meager
gains
among
the
states
there
were
occasional
flurries
of
hope
for
immediate
action
on
the
federal
amendment
between
and
the
senate
committee
reported
the
suffrage
resolution
by  favorable
majority
on
five
different
occasions
during
the
same
period
however
there
were
nine
unfavorable
reports
and
only
once
did
the
subject
reach
the
point
of  general
debate
at
no
time
could
anything
like
the
required
two
thirds
vote
be
obtained
the
changing
status
of
women
while
the
suffrage
movement
was
lagging
the
activities
of

in
other
directions
were
steadily
multiplying

other

especially
the
state
universities
of
the
west
opened
their
doors
to
women
and
women
were
received
into
the
professions
of
law
and
medicine
by
the
rapid
growth
of
public
high
schools
in
which
girls
enjoyed
the
same
rights
as
boys
education
was
extended
still
more
widely
the
number
of
women
teachers
increased
by
leaps
and
bounds
meanwhile
women
were
entering
nearly
every
branch
of
industry
and
business
how
many
of
them
worked
at
gainful
occupations
before
we
do
not
know
but
from
that
year
forward
we
have
the
records
of
the
census
between
and
the
proportion
of
women
in
the
professions
rose
from
less
than
two
per
cent
to
more
than
ten
per
cent
in
trade
and
transportation
from
per

to
per

and
in
manufacturing
from
to
per
cent
in
there
were
over
women
gainfully
employed
as
compared
with
men
when
during
the
war
on
germany
the
government
established
the
principle
of
equal
pay
for
equal
work
and
gave
official
recognition
to
the
value
of
their
services
in
industry
it
was
discovered
how
far
women
had
traveled
along
the
road
forecast
by
the
leaders
of
the
club
movement
among
women
all
over
the
country
women  societies
and
clubs
were
started
to
advance
this
or
that
reform
or
merely
to
study
literature
art
and
science
in
time
these
women  organizations
of
all
kinds
were
federated
into
city
state
and
national
associations
and
drawn
into
the
consideration
of
public
questions
under
the
leadership
of
frances
willard
they
made
temperance
reform  vital
issue
they
took
an
interest
in
legislation
pertaining
to
prisons
pure
food
public
health
and
municipal
government
among
other
things
at
their
sessions
and
conferences
local
state
and
national
issues
were
discussed
until
finally
it
seems
everything
led
to
the
quest
of
the
franchise
by
solemn
resolution
in
the
national
federation
of
women  clubs
representing
nearly
two
million
club
women
formally
endorsed

in

the

time

arrived
for  new

of

suffragists
sought
to
use
the

of

to
compel

or
both
of

national

then
came
upon

from
every
direction
from
the
suffragists
who
made  straight
appeal
on
the
grounds
of
justice
and
from
the
suffragists

besought
the

the

was  thing
of

as
president
roosevelt
later
said
in
speaking
of
the
great

strike  few
generations
ago
the
american

could
have

gone

taken

now
the

were

in

days  man
who

with  pick

might

that
outlet
was
now
closed
as
regards
the
immense
majority
the
majority
of
men
who
earned
wages
in
the
coal
industry
if
they
wished
to
progress
at
all
were
compelled
to
progress
not
by
ceasing
to
be
wage
earners
but
by
improving
the
conditions
under
which
all
the
wage
earners
of
the
country
lived
and
worked
the
disappearance
of
the
free
land
president
roosevelt
went
on
to
say
also
produced  crass
inequality
in
the
bargaining
relation
of
the
employer
and
the
individual
employee
standing
alone
the
great
coal
mining
and
coal
carrying
companies
which
employed
their
tens
of
thousands
could
easily
dispense
with
the
services
of
any
particular
miner
the
miner
on
the
other
hand
however
expert
could
not
dispense
with
the
companies
he
needed  job
his
wife
and
children
would
starve
if
he
did
not
get
one
individually
the
miners
were
impotent
when
they
sought
to
enter  wage
contract
with
the
great
companies
they
could
make
fair
terms
only
by
uniting
into
trade
unions
to
bargain
collectively
it
was
of
this
state
of
affairs
that
president
taft
spoke
when
he
favored
the
modification
of
the
common
law
so
as
to
put
employees
of
little
power
and
means
on  level
with
their
employers
in
adjusting
and
agreeing
upon
their
mutual
obligations
john  rockefeller
jr
on
the
side
of
the
great
captains
of
industry
recognized
the
same
facts
he
said
in
the
early
days
of
the
development
of
industry
the
employer
and
capital
investor
were
frequently
one
daily
contact
was
had
between
him
and
his
employees
who
were
his
friends
and
neighbors
because
of
the
proportions
which
modern
industry
has
attained
employers
and
employees
are
too
often
strangers
to
each
other
personal
relations
can
be
revived
only
through
adequate
representation
of
the
employees
representation
is  principle
which
is
fundamentally
just
and
vital
to
the
successful
conduct
of
industry
it
is
not
consistent
for
us
as
americans
to
demand
democracy
in
government
and
practice
autocracy
in
industry
with
the
developments
what
they
are
in
industry
to
day
there
is
sure
to
come  progressive
evolution
from
aristocratic
single
control
whether
by
capital
labor
or
the
state
to
democratic
cooperative
control
by
all
three
cooperation
between

and
employees
company
unions
the
changed
economic
life
described
by
the
three
eminent
men
just
quoted
was
acknowledged
by
several
great
companies
and
business
concerns
all
over
the
country
decided
efforts
were
made
to
bridge
the
gulf
which
industry
and
the
corporation
had
created
among
the
devices
adopted
was
that
of
the
company
union
in
one
of
the
western
lumber
mills
for
example
all
the
employees
were
invited
to
join  company
organization
they
held
monthly
meetings
to
discuss
matters
of
common
concern
they
elected  shop
committee
to
confer
with
the
representatives
of
the
company
and
periodically
the
agents
of
the
employers
attended
the
conferences
of
the
men
to
talk
over
matters
of
mutual
interest
the
function
of
the
shop
committee
was
to
consider
wages
hours
safety
rules
sanitation
recreation
and
other
problems
whenever
any
employee
had  grievance
he
took
it
up
with
the
foreman
and
if
it
was
not
settled
to
his
satisfaction
he
brought
it
before
the
shop
committee
if
the
members
of
the
shop
committee
decided
in
favor
of
the
man
with  grievance
they
attempted
to
settle
the
matter
with
the
company  agents
all
these
things
failing
the
dispute
was
transferred
to  grand
meeting
of
all
the
employees
with
the
employers
representatives
in
common
council  deadlock
if
it
ensued
from
such  conference
was
broken
by
calling
in
impartial
arbitrators
selected
by
both
sides
from
among
citizens
outside
the
mill
thus
the
employees
were
given  voice
in
all
decisions
affecting
their
work
and
welfare
rights
and
grievances
were
treated
as
matters
of
mutual
interest
rather
than
individual
concern
representatives
of
trade
unions
from
outside
however
were
rigidly
excluded
from
all
negotiations
between
employers
and
the
employees
profit
sharing
another
proposal
for
drawing
capital
and
labor
together
was
to
supplement
the
wage
system
by
other
ties
sometimes
lump
sums
were
paid
to
employees
who
remained
in  company  service
for  definite
period
of
years
again
they
were
given  certain
percentage
of
the
annual
profits
in
other
instances
employees
were
allowed
to
buy
stock
on
easy
terms
and
thus
become
part
owners
in
the
concern
this
last
plan
was
carried
so
far
by  large
soap
manufacturing
company
that
the
employees
besides
becoming
stockholders
secured
the
right
to
elect
representatives
to
serve
on
the
board
of
directors
who
managed
the
entire
business
so
extensive
had
profit
sharing
become
by
that
the
federal
industrial
relations
committee
appointed
by
the
president
deemed
it
worthy
of  special
study
though
opposed
by
regular
trade
unions
it
was
undoubtedly
growing
in
popularity
labor
managers
and
welfare
work
another
effort
of
employers
to
meet
the
problems
of
the
new
age
appeared
in
the
appointment
of
specialists
known
as
employment
managers
whose
task
it
was
to
study
the
relations
existing
between
masters
and
workers
and
discover
practical
methods
for
dealing
with
each
grievance
as
it
arose
by
hundreds
of
big
companies
had
recognized
this
modern
profession
and
universities
were
giving
courses
of
instruction
on
the
subject
to
young
men
and
women
in
that
year  national
conference
of
employment
managers
was
held
at
rochester
new
york
the
discussion
revealed  wide
range
of
duties
assigned
to
managers
including
questions
of
wages
hours
sanitation
rest
rooms
recreational
facilities
and
welfare
work
of
every
kind
designed
to
make
the
conditions
in
mills
and
factories
safer
and
more
humane
thus
it
was
evident
that
hundreds
of
employers
had
abandoned
the
old
idea
that
they
were
dealing
merely
with
individual
employees
and
that
their
obligations
ended
with
the
payment
of
any
wages
they
saw
fit
to
fix
in
short
they
were
seeking
to
develop  spirit
of
cooperation
to
take
the
place
of
competition
and
enmity
and
to
increase
the
production
of
commodities
by
promoting
the
efficiency
and
happiness
of
the
producers
the
rise
and
growth
of
organized
labor
the
american
federation
of
labor
meanwhile  powerful
association
of
workers
representing
all
the
leading
trades
and
crafts
organized
into
unions
of
their
own
had
been
built
up
outside
the
control
of
employers
this
was
the
american
federation
of
labor  nation
wide
union
of
unions
founded
in
on
the
basis
of
beginnings
made
five
years
before
at
the
time
of
its
establishment
it
had
approximately
members
its
growth
up
to
the
end
of
the
century
was
slow
for
the
total
enrollment
in
was
only
at
that
point
the
increase
became
marked
the
membership
reached
in
and
more
than
in
to
be
counted
in
the
ranks
of
organized
labor
were
several
strong
unions
friendly
to
the
federation
though
not
affiliated
with
it
such
for
example
were
the
railway
brotherhoods
with
more
than
half  million
members
by
the
opening
of
the
total
strength
of
organized
labor
was
put
at
about
members
meaning
if
we
include
their
families
that
nearly
one
fifth
of
the
people
of
the
united
states
were
in
some
positive
way
dependent
upon
the
operations
of
trade
unions
historical
background
this
was
the
culmination
of  long
and
significant
history
before
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
century
the
skilled
workmen
printers
shoemakers
tailors
and
carpenters
had
as
we
have
seen
formed
local
unions
in
the
large
cities
between
and
several
aggressive
steps
were
taken
in
the
american
labor
movement
for
one
thing
the
number
of
local
unions
increased
by
leaps
and
bounds
in
all
the
industrial
towns
for
another
there
was
established
in
every
large
manufacturing
city  central
labor
body
composed
of
delegates
from
the
unions
of
the
separate
trades
in
the
local
union
the
printers
or
the
cordwainers
for
example
considered
only
their
special
trade
problems
in
the
central
labor
union
printers
cordwainers
iron
molders
and
other
craftsmen
considered
common
problems
and
learned
to
cooperate
with
one
another
in
enforcing
the
demands
of
each
craft  third
step
was
the
federation
of
the
unions
of
the
same
craftsmen
in
different
cities
the
printers
of
new
york
philadelphia
boston
and
other
towns
for
instance
drew
together
and
formed  national
trade
union
of
printers
built
upon
the
local
unions
of
that
craft
by
the
eve
of
the
civil
war
there
were
four
or
five
powerful
national
unions
of
this
character
the
expansion
of
the
railway
made
travel
and
correspondence
easier
and
national
conventions
possible
even
for
workmen
of
small
means
about
an
attempt
was
made
to
federate
the
unions
of
all
the
different
crafts
into  national
organization
but
the
effort
was
premature
the
national
labor
union
the
plan
which
failed
in
was
tried
again
in
the
sixties
during
the
war
industries
and
railways
had
flourished
as
never
before
prices
had
risen
rapidly
the
demand
for
labor
had
increased
wages
had
mounted
slowly
but
steadily
hundreds
of
new
local
unions
had
been
founded
and
eight
or
ten
national
trade
unions
had
sprung
into
being
the
time
was
ripe
it
seemed
for  national
consolidation
of
all
labor  forces
and
in
the
year
after
the
surrender
of
general
lee
at
appomattox
the
national
labor
union
was
formed
at
baltimore
under
the
leadership
of
an
experienced
organizer  h
sylvis
of
the
iron
molders
the
purpose
of
the
national
labor
union
was
not
merely
to
secure
labor  standard
demands
touching
hours
wages
and
conditions
of
work
or
to
maintain
the
gains
already
won
it
leaned
toward
political
action
and
radical
opinions
above
all
it
sought
to
eliminate
the
conflict
between
capital
and
labor
by
making
workingmen
the
owners
of
shops
through
the
formation
of
cooperative
industries
for
six
years
the
national
labor
union
continued
to
hold
conferences
and
carry
on
its
propaganda
but
most
of
the
cooperative
enterprises
failed
political
dissensions
arose
and
by
the
experiment
had
come
to
an
end
the
knights
of
labor
while
the
national
labor
union
was
experimenting
there
grew
up
in
the
industrial
world  more
radical
organization
known
as
the
noble
order
of
the
knights
of
labor
it
was
founded
in
philadelphia
in
first
as  secret
society
with
rituals
signs
and
pass
words
so
that
no
spy
of
the
boss
can
find
his
way
into
the
lodge
room
to
betray
his
fellows
as
the
knights
put
it
in
form
the
new
organization
was
simple
it
sought
to
bring
all
laborers
skilled
and
unskilled
men
and
women
white
and
colored
into  mighty
body
of
local
and
national
unions
without
distinction
of
trade
or
craft
by
ten
years
after
the
national
organization
was
established
it
boasted  membership
of
over
in
philosophy
the
knights
of
labor
were
socialistic
for
they
advocated
public
ownership
of
the
railways
and
other
utilities
and
the
formation
of
cooperative
societies
to
own
and
manage
stores
and
factories
as
the
knights
were
radical
in
spirit
and
their
strikes
numerous
and
prolonged
were
often
accompanied
by
violence
the
organization
alarmed
employers
and
the
general
public
raising
up
against
itself  vigorous
opposition
weaknesses
within
as
well
as
foes
from
without
started
the
knights
on
the
path
to
dissolution
they
waged
more
strikes
than
they
could
carry
on
successfully
their
cooperative
experiments
failed
as
those
of
other
labor
groups
before
them
had
failed
and
the
rank
and
file
could
not
be
kept
in
line
the
majority
of
the
members
wanted
immediate
gains
in
wages
or
the
reduction
of
hours
when
their
hopes
were
not
realized
they
drifted
away
from
the
order
the
troubles
were
increased
by
the
appearance
of
the
american
federation
of
labor  still
mightier
organization
composed
mainly
of
skilled
workers
who
held
strategic
positions
in
industry
when
they
failed
to
secure
the
effective
support
of
the
federation
in
their
efforts
to
organize
the
unskilled
the
employers
closed
in
upon
them
then
the
knights
declined
rapidly
in
power
by
they
were  negligible
factor
and
in  short
time
they
passed
into
the
limbo
of
dead
experiments
the
policies
of
the
american
federation
unlike
the
knights
of
labor
the
american
federation
of
labor
sought
first
of
all
to
be
very
practical
in
its
objects
and
methods
it
avoided
all
kinds
of
socialistic
theories
and
attended
strictly
to
the
business
of
organizing
unions
for
the
purpose
of
increasing
wages
shortening
hours
and
improving
working
conditions
for
its
members
it
did
not
try
to
include
everybody
in
one
big
union
but
brought
together
the
employees
of
each
particular
craft
whose
interests
were
clearly
the
same
to
prepare
for
strikes
and
periods
of
unemployment
it
raised
large
funds
by
imposing
heavy
dues
and
created  benefit
system
to
hold
men
loyally
to
the
union
in
order
to
permit
action
on  national
scale
it
gave
the
superior
officers
extensive
powers
over
local
unions
while
declaring
that
employers
and
employees
had
much
in
common
the
federation
strongly
opposed
company
unions
employers
it
argued
were
affiliated
with
the
national
manufacturers
association
or
with
similar
employers
organizations
every
important
industry
was
now
national
in
scope
and
wages
and
hours
in
view
of
competition
with
other
shops
could
not
be
determined
in  single
factory
no
matter
how
amicable
might
be
the
relations
of
the
company
and
its
workers
in
that
particular
plant
for
these
reasons
the
federation
declared
company
unions
and
local
shop
committees
inherently
weak
it
insisted
that
hours
wages
and
other
labor
standards
should
be
fixed
by
general
trade
agreements
applicable
to
all
the
plants
of  given
industry
even
if
subject
to
local
modifications
at
the
same
time
the
federation
far
from
deliberately
antagonizing
employers
sought
to
enlist
their
cooperation
and
support
it
affiliated
with
the
national
civic
federation
an
association
of
business
men
financiers
and
professional
men
founded
in
to
promote
friendly
relations
in
the
industrial
world
in
brief
the
american
federation
of
labor
accepted
the
modern
industrial
system
and
by
organization
within
it
endeavored
to
secure
certain
definite
terms
and
conditions
for
trade
unionists
the
wider
relations
of
organized
labor
the
socialists
the
trade
unionism
pure
and
simple
espoused
by
the
american
federation
of
labor
seemed
to
involve
at
first
glance
nothing
but
businesslike
negotiations
with
employers
in
practice
it
did
not
work
out
that
way
the
federation
was
only
six
years
old
when  new
organization
appealing
directly
for
the
labor
vote
namely
the
socialist
labor
party
nominated  candidate
for
president
launched
into  national
campaign
and
called
upon
trade
unionists
to
desert
the
older
parties
and
enter
its
fold
the
socialistic
idea
introduced
into
national
politics
in
had
been
long
in
germination
before
the
civil
war  number
of
reformers
including
nathaniel
hawthorne
horace
greeley
and
wendell
phillips
deeply
moved
by
the
poverty
of
the
great
industrial
cities
had
earnestly
sought
relief
in
the
establishment
of
cooperative
or
communistic
colonies
they
believed
that
people
should
go
into
the
country
secure
land
and
tools
own
them
in
common
so
that
no
one
could
profit
from
exclusive
ownership
and
produce
by
common
labor
the
food
and
clothing
necessary
for
their
support
for  time
this
movement
attracted
wide
interest
but
it
had
little
vitality
nearly
all
the
colonies
failed
selfishness
and
indolence
usually
disrupted
the
best
of
them
in
the
course
of
time
this
utopian
idea
was
abandoned
and
another
set
of
socialist
doctrines
claiming
to
be
more
scientific
appeared
instead
the
new
school
of
socialists
adopting
the
principles
of  german
writer
and
agitator
karl
marx
appealed
directly
to
workingmen
it
urged
them
to
unite
against
the
capitalists
to
get
possession
of
the
machinery
of
government
and
to
introduce
collective
or
public
ownership
of
railways
land
mines
mills
and
other
means
of
production
the
marxian
socialists
therefore
became
political
they
sought
to
organize
labor
and
to
win
elections
like
the
other
parties
they
put
forward
candidates
and
platforms
the
socialist
labor
party
in
for
example
declared
in
favor
of
government
ownership
of
utilities
free
school
books
woman
suffrage
heavy
income
taxes
and
the
referendum
the
socialist
party
founded
in
with
eugene  debs
the
leader
of
the
pullman
strike
as
its
candidate
called
for
public
ownership
of
all
trusts
monopolies
mines
railways
and
the
chief
means
of
production
in
the
course
of
time
the
vote
of
the
latter
organization
rose
to
considerable
proportions
reaching
almost  million
in
it
declined
four
years
later
and
then
rose
in
to
about
the
same
figure
in
their
appeal
for
votes
the
socialists
of
every
type
turned
first
to
labor
at
the
annual
conventions
of
the
american
federation
of
labor
they
besought
the
delegates
to
endorse
socialism
the
president
of
the
federation
samuel
gompers
on
each
occasion
took
the
floor
against
them
he
repudiated
socialism
and
the
socialists
on
both
theoretical
and
practical
grounds
he
opposed
too
much
public
ownership
declaring
that
the
government
was
as
likely
as
any
private
employer
to
oppress
labor
the
approval
of
socialism
he
maintained
would
split
the
federation
on
the
rock
of
politics
weaken
it
in
its
fight
for
higher
wages
and
shorter
hours
and
prejudice
the
public
against
it
at
every
turn
he
was
able
to
vanquish
the
socialists
in
the
federation
although
he
could
not
prevent
it
from
endorsing
public
ownership
of
the
railways
at
the
convention
of
the
extreme
radicals
some
of
the
socialists
defeated
in
their
efforts
to
capture
organized
labor
and
seeing
that
the
gains
in
elections
were
very
meager
broke
away
from
both
trade
unionism
and
politics
one
faction
the
industrial
workers
of
the
world
founded
in
declared
themselves
opposed
to
all
capitalists
the
wages
system
and
craft
unions
they
asserted
that
the
working
class
and
the
employing
class
have
nothing
in
common
and
that
trade
unions
only
pitted
one
set
of
workers
against
another
set
they
repudiated
all
government
ownership
and
the
government
itself
boldly
proclaiming
their
intention
to
unite
all
employees
into
one
big
union
and
seize
the
railways
mines
and
mills
of
the
country
this
doctrine
so
revolutionary
in
tone
called
down
upon
the
extremists
the
condemnation
of
the
american
federation
of
labor
as
well
as
of
the
general
public
at
its
convention
in
the
federation
went
on
record
as
opposed
to
bolshevism  w  ism
and
the
irresponsible
leadership
that
encourages
such  policy
it
announced
its
firm
adherence
to
american
ideals
the
federation
and
political
issues
the
hostility
of
the
federation
to
the
socialists
did
not
mean
however
that
it
was
indifferent
to
political
issues
or
political
parties
on
the
contrary
from
time
to
time
at
its
annual
conventions
it
endorsed
political
and
social
reforms
such
as
the
initiative
referendum
and
recall
the
abolition
of
child
labor
the
exclusion
of
oriental
labor
old
age
pensions
and
government
ownership
moreover
it
adopted
the
policy
of
rewarding
friends
and
punishing
enemies
by
advising
members
to
vote
for
or
against
candidates
according
to
their
stand
on
the
demands
of
organized
labor
illustration

underwood
and
underwood  y
samuel
gompers
and
other
labor
leaders
this
policy
was
pursued
with
especial
zeal
in
connection
with
disputes
over
the
use
of
injunctions
in
labor
controversies
an
injunction
is  bill
or
writ
issued
by  judge
ordering
some
person
or
corporation
to
do
or
to
refrain
from
doing
something
for
example  judge
may
order  trade
union
to
refrain
from
interfering
with
non
union
men
or
to
continue
at
work
handling
goods
made
by
non
union
labor
and
he
may
fine
or
imprison
those
who
disobey
his
injunction
the
penalty
being
inflicted
for
contempt
of
court
this
ancient
legal
device
came
into
prominence
in
connection
with
nation
wide
railway
strikes
in
it
was
applied
with
increasing
frequency
after
its
effective
use
against
eugene  debs
in
the
pullman
strike
of
aroused
by
the
extensive
use
of
the
writ
organized
labor
demanded
that
the
power
of
judges
to
issue
injunctions
in
labor
disputes
be
limited
by
law
representatives
of
the
unions
sought
support
from
the
democrats
and
the
republicans
they
received
from
the
former
very
specific
and
cordial
endorsement
in
the
democratic
platform
denounced
government
by
injunction
as  new
and
highly
dangerous
form
of
oppression
mr
gompers
while
refusing
to
commit
the
federation
to
democratic
politics
privately
supported
mr
bryan
in
he
came
out
openly
and
boasted
that
eighty
per
cent
of
the
votes
of
the
federation
had
been
cast
for
the
democratic
candidate
again
in
the
same
policy
was
pursued
the
reward
was
the
enactment
in
of  federal
law
exempting
trade
unions
from
prosecution
as
combinations
in
restraint
of
trade
limiting
the
use
of
the
injunction
in
labor
disputes
and
prescribing
trial
by
jury
in
case
of
contempt
of
court
this
measure
was
hailed
by
mr
gompers
as
the
magna
carta
of
labor
and  vindication
of
his
policy
as  matter
of
fact
however
it
did
not
prevent
the
continued
use
of
injunctions
against
trade
unions
nevertheless
mr
gompers
was
unshaken
in
his
conviction
that
organized
labor
should
not
attempt
to
form
an
independent
political
party
or
endorse
socialist
or
other
radical
economic
theories
organized
labor
and
the
public
besides
its
relations
to
employers
radicals
within
its
own
ranks
and
political
questions
the
federation
had
to
face
responsibilities
to
the
general
public
with
the
passing
of
time
these
became
heavy
and
grave
while
industries
were
small
and
conflicts
were
local
in
character  strike
seldom
affected
anybody
but
the
employer
and
the
employees
immediately
involved
in
it
when
however
industries
and
trade
unions
became
organized
on  national
scale
and  strike
could
paralyze  basic
enterprise
like
coal
mining
or
railways
the
vital
interests
of
all
citizens
were
put
in
jeopardy
moreover
as
increases
in
wages
and
reductions
in
hours
often
added
directly
to
the
cost
of
living
the
action
of
the
unions
affected
the
well
being
of
all
the
food
clothing
and
shelter
of
the
whole
people
for
the
purpose
of
meeting
the
issue
raised
by
this
state
of
affairs
it
was
suggested
that
employers
and
employees
should
lay
their
disputes
before
commissions
of
arbitration
for
decision
and
settlement
president
cleveland
in  message
of
april
proposed
such  method
for
disposing
of
industrial
controversies
and
two
years
later
congress
enacted  voluntary
arbitration
law
applicable
to
the
railways
the
principle
was
extended
in
and
again
in
and
under
the
authority
of
the
federal
government
many
contentions
in
the
railway
world
were
settled
by
arbitration
the
success
of
such
legislation
induced
some
students
of
industrial
questions
to
urge
that
unions
and
employers
should
be
compelled
to
submit
all
disputes
to
official
tribunals
of
arbitration
kansas
actually
passed
such  law
in
congress
in
the
esch
cummins
railway
bill
of
the
same
year
created  federal
board
of
nine
members
to
which
all
railway
controversies
not
settled
by
negotiation
must
be
submitted
strikes
however
were
not
absolutely
forbidden
generally
speaking
both
employers
and
employees
opposed
compulsory
adjustments
without
offering
any
substitute
in
case
voluntary
arbitration
should
not
be
accepted
by
both
parties
to  dispute
immigration
and
americanization
the
problems
of
immigration
from
its
very
inception
the
american
federation
of
labor
like
the
knights
of
labor
before
it
was
confronted
by
numerous
questions
raised
by
the
ever
swelling
tide
of
aliens
coming
to
our
shores
in
its
effort
to
make
each
trade
union
all
inclusive
it
had
to
wrestle
with  score
or
more
languages
when
it
succeeded
in
thoroughly
organizing  craft
it
often
found
its
purposes
defeated
by
an
influx
of
foreigners
ready
to
work
for
lower
wages
and
thus
undermine
the
foundations
of
the
union
at
the
same
time
persons
outside
the
labor
movement
began
to
be
apprehensive
as
they
contemplated
the
undoubted
evil
as
well
as
the
good
that
seemed
to
be
associated
with
the
alien
invasion
they
saw
whole
sections
of
great
cities
occupied
by
people
speaking
foreign
tongues
reading
only
foreign
newspapers
and
looking
to
the
old
world
alone
for
their
ideas
and
their
customs
they
witnessed
an
expanding
army
of
total
illiterates
men
and
women
who
could
read
and
write
no
language
at
all
while
among
those
aliens
who
could
read
few
there
were
who
knew
anything
of
american
history
traditions
and
ideals
official
reports
revealed
that
over
twenty
per
cent
of
the
men
of
the
draft
army
during
the
world
war
could
not
read  newspaper
or
write  letter
home
perhaps
most
alarming
of
all
was
the
discovery
that
thousands
of
alien
men
are
in
the
united
states
only
on  temporary
sojourn
solely
to
make
money
and
return
home
with
their
savings
these
men
willing
to
work
for
low
wages
and
live
in
places
unfit
for
human
beings
have
no
stake
in
this
country
and
do
not
care
what
becomes
of
it
the
restriction
of
immigration
in
all
this
there
was
strictly
speaking
no
cause
for
surprise
since
the
foundation
of
our
republic
the
policy
of
the
government
had
been
to
encourage
the
coming
of
the
alien
for
nearly
one
hundred
years
no
restraining
act
was
passed
by
congress
while
two
important
laws
positively
encouraged
it
namely
the
homestead
act
of
and
the
contract
immigration
law
of
not
until
american
workingmen
came
into
open
collision
with
cheap
chinese
labor
on
the
pacific
coast
did
the
federal
government
spread
the
first
measure
of
limitation
on
the
statute
books
after
the
discovery
of
gold
and
particularly
after
the
opening
of
the
railway
construction
era  horde
of
laborers
from
china
descended
upon
california
accustomed
to
starvation
wages
and
indifferent
to
the
conditions
of
living
they
threatened
to
cut
the
american
standard
to
the
point
of
subsistence
by
the
protest
of
american
labor
was
loud
and
long
and
both
the
republicans
and
the
democrats
gave
heed
to
it
in
congress
enacted  law
prohibiting
the
admission
of
chinese
laborers
to
the
united
states
for  term
of
ten
years
later
extended
by
legislation
in  little
while
the
demand
arose
for
the
exclusion
of
the
japanese
as
well
in
this
case
no
exclusion
law
was
passed
but
an
understanding
was
reached
by
which
japan
agreed
not
to
issue
passports
to
her
laborers
authorizing
them
to
come
to
the
united
states
by
act
of
congress
in
the
president
was
empowered
to
exclude
any
laborers
who
having
passports
to
canada
hawaii
or
mexico
attempted
to
enter
our
country
these
laws
and
agreements
however
did
not
remove
all
grounds
for
the
agitation
of
the
subject
they
were
difficult
to
enforce
and
it
was
claimed
by
residents
of
the
coast
that
in
spite
of
federal
authority
oriental
laborers
were
finding
their
way
into
american
ports
moreover
several
western
states
anxious
to
preserve
the
soil
for
american
ownership
enacted
laws
making
it
impossible
for
chinese
and
japanese
to
buy
land
outright
and
in
other
ways
they
discriminated
against
orientals
such
proceedings
placed
the
federal
government
in
an
embarrassing
position
by
treaty
it
had
guaranteed
specific
rights
to
japanese
citizens
in
the
united
states
and
the
government
at
tokyo
contended
that
the
state
laws
just
cited
violated
the
terms
of
the
international
agreement
the
western
states
were
fixed
in
their
determination
to
control
oriental
residents
japan
was
equally
persistent
in
asking
that
no
badge
of
inferiority
be
attached
to
her
citizens
subjected
to
pressure
on
both
sides
the
federal
government
sought  way
out
of
the
deadlock
having
embarked
upon
the
policy
of
restriction
in
congress
readily
extended
it
in
that
same
year
it
barred
paupers
criminals
convicts
and
the
insane
three
years
later
mainly
owing
to
the
pressure
of
the
knights
of
labor
it
forbade
any
person
company
or
association
to
import
aliens
under
contract
by
an
act
of
the
contract
labor
restriction
was
made
even
more
severe
in
anarchists
were
excluded
and
the
bureau
of
immigration
was
transferred
from
the
treasury
department
to
the
department
of
commerce
and
labor
in
order
to
provide
for  more
rigid
execution
of
the
law
in
the
classes
of
persons
denied
admission
were
widened
to
embrace
those
suffering
from
physical
and
mental
defects
and
otherwise
unfit
for
effective
citizenship
when
the
department
of
labor
was
established
in
the
enforcement
of
the
law
was
placed
in
the
hands
of
the
secretary
of
labor  b
wilson
who
was  former
leader
in
the
american
federation
of
labor
the
literacy
test
still
the
advocates
of
restriction
were
not
satisfied
still
organized
labor
protested
and
demanded
more
protection
against
the
competition
of
immigrants
in
it
won  thirty
year
battle
in
the
passage
of  bill
excluding
all
aliens
over
sixteen
years
of
age
physically
capable
of
reading
who
cannot
read
the
english
language
or
some
other

including
hebrew
or
yiddish
even
president
wilson
could
not
block
it
for  two
thirds
vote
to
overcome
his
veto
was
mustered
in
congress
this
act
while
it
served
to
exclude
illiterates
made
no
drastic
cut
in
the
volume
of
immigration
indeed  material
reduction
was
resolutely
opposed
in
many
quarters
people
of
certain
nationalities
already
in
the
united
states
objected
to
every
barrier
that
shut
out
their
own
kinsmen
some
americans
of
the
old
stock
still
held
to
the
idea
that
the
united
states
should
continue
to
be
an
asylum
for
the
oppressed
of
the
earth
many
employers
looked
upon
an
increased
labor
supply
as
the
means
of
escaping
what
they
called
the
domination
of
trade
unions
in
the
babel
of
countless
voices
the
discussion
of
these
vital
matters
went
on
in

americanization
intimately
connected
with
the
subject
of
immigration
was  call
for
the
americanization
of
the
alien
already
within
our
gates
the
revelation
of
the
illiteracy
in
the
army
raised
the
cry
and
the
demand
was
intensified
when
it
was
found
that
many
of
the
leaders
among
the
extreme
radicals
were
foreign
in
birth
and
citizenship
innumerable
programs
for
assimilating
the
alien
to
american
life
were
drawn
up
and
in  national
conference
on
the
subject
was
held
in
washington
under
the
auspices
of
the
department
of
the
interior
all
were
agreed
that

of

are
the
underlying
necessity

thus
spoke
woodrow
wilson
during
his
campaign
for
election
in
this
spirit
as
president
he
gave
the
signal
for
work
by
summoning
congress
in  special
session
on
april
he
invited
the
cooperation
of
all
forward
looking
men
and
indicated
that
he
would
assume
the
role
of
leadership
as
an
evidence
of
his
resolve
he
appeared
before
congress
in
person
to
read
his
first
message
reviving
the
old
custom
of
washington
and
adams
then
he
let
it
be
known
that
he
would
not
give
his
party
any
rest
until
it
fulfilled
its
pledges
to
the
country
when
democratic
senators
balked
at
tariff
reductions
they
were
sharply
informed
that
the
party
had
plighted
its
word
and
that
no
excuses
or
delays
would
be
tolerated
domestic
legislation
financial
measures
under
this
spirited
leadership
congress
went
to
work
passing
first
the
underwood
tariff
act
of
which
made  downward
revision
in
the
rates
of
duty
fixing
them
on
the
average
about
twenty
six
per
cent
lower
than
the
figures
of
the
protective
principle
was
retained
but
an
effort
was
made
to
permit  moderate
element
of
foreign
competition
as  part
of
the
revenue
act
congress
levied  tax
on
incomes
as
authorized
by
the
sixteenth
amendment
to
the
constitution
the
tax
which
roused
such
party
passions
twenty
years
before
was
now
accepted
as  matter
of
course
having
disposed
of
the
tariff
congress
took
up
the
old
and
vexatious
currency
question
and
offered  new
solution
in
the
form
of
the
federal
reserve
law
of
december
this
measure
one
of
the
most
interesting
in
the
history
of
federal
finance
embraced
four
leading
features
in
the
first
place
it
continued
the
prohibition
on
the
issuance
of
notes
by
state
banks
and
provided
for  national
currency
in
the
second
place
it
put
the
new
banking
system
under
the
control
of  federal
reserve
board
composed
entirely
of
government
officials
to
prevent
the
growth
of  central
money
power
it
provided
in
the
third
place
for
the
creation
of
twelve
federal
reserve
banks
one
in
each
of
twelve
great
districts
into
which
the
country
is
divided
all
local
national
banks
were
required
and
certain
other
banks
permitted
to
become
members
of
the
new
system
and
share
in
its
control
finally
with  view
to
expanding
the
currency  step
which
the
democrats
had
long
urged
upon
the
country
the
issuance
of
paper
money
under
definite
safeguards
was
authorized
mindful
of
the
agricultural
interest
ever
dear
to
the
heart
of
jefferson  followers
the
democrats
supplemented
the
reserve
law
by
the
farm
loan
act
of
creating
federal
agencies
to
lend
money
on
farm
mortgages
at
moderate
rates
of
interest
within  year
had
been
lent
to
farmers
the
heaviest
borrowing
being
in
nine
western
and
southern
states
with
texas
in
the
lead
anti
trust
legislation
the
tariff
and
currency
laws
were
followed
by
three
significant
measures
relative
to
trusts
rejecting
utterly
the
progressive
doctrine
of
government
regulation
president
wilson
announced
that
it
was
the
purpose
of
the
democrats
to
destroy
monopoly
and
maintain
competition
as
the
only
effective
instrument
of
business
liberty
the
first
step
in
this
direction
the
clayton
anti
trust
act
carried
into
great
detail
the
sherman
law
of
forbidding
and
penalizing
combinations
in
restraint
of
interstate
and
foreign
trade
in
every
line
it
revealed  determined
effort
to
tear
apart
the
great
trusts
and
to
put
all
business
on  competitive
basis
its
terms
were
reinforced
in
the
same
year
by  law
creating  federal
trade
commission
empowered
to
inquire
into
the
methods
of
corporations
and
lodge
complaints
against
concerns
using
any
unfair
method
of
competition
in
only
one
respect
was
the
severity
of
the
democratic
policy
relaxed
an
act
of
provided
that
the
sherman
law
should
not
apply
to
companies
engaged
in
export
trade
the
purpose
being
to
encourage
large
corporations
to
enter
foreign
commerce
the
effect
of
this
whole
body
of
anti
trust
legislation
in
spite
of
much
labor
on
it
remained
problematical
very
few
combinations
were
dissolved
as  result
of
it
startling
investigations
were
made
into
alleged
abuses
on
the
part
of
trusts
but
it
could
hardly
be
said
that
huge
business
concerns
had
lost
any
of
their
predominance
in
american
industry
labor
legislation
by
no
mere
coincidence
the
clayton
anti
trust
law
of
made
many
concessions
to
organized
labor
it
declared
that
the
labor
of  human
being
is
not  commodity
or
an
article
of
commerce
and
it
exempted
unions
from
prosecution
as
combinations
in
restraint
of
trade
it
likewise
defined
and
limited
the
uses
which
the
federal
courts
might
make
of
injunctions
in
labor
disputes
and
guaranteed
trial
by
jury
to
those
guilty
of
disobedience
see  the
clayton
law
was
followed
the
next
year
by
the
seamen  act
giving
greater
liberty
of
contract
to
american
sailors
and
requiring
an
improvement
of
living
conditions
on
shipboard
this
was
such  drastic
law
that
shipowners
declared
themselves
unable
to
meet
foreign
competition
under
its
terms
owing
to
the
low
labor
standards
of
other
countries
still
more
extraordinary
than
the
seamen  act
was
the
adamson
law
of
fixing  standard
eight
hour
work
day
for
trainmen
on
railroads  measure
wrung
from
congress
under  threat
of  great
strike
by
the
four
railway
brotherhoods
this
act
viewed
by
union
leaders
as  triumph
called
forth  bitter
denunciation
of
trade
union
domination
but
it
was
easier
to
criticize
than
to
find
another
solution
of
the
problem
three
other
laws
enacted
during
president
wilson  administration
were
popular
in
the
labor
world
one
of
them
provided
compensation
for
federal
employees
injured
in
the
discharge
of
their
duties
another
prohibited
the
labor
of
children
under  certain
age
in
the
industries
of
the
nation  third
prescribed
for
coal
miners
in
alaska
an
eight
hour
day
and
modern
safeguards
for
life
and
health
there
were
positive
proofs
that
organized
labor
had
obtained  large
share
of
power
in
the
councils
of
the
country
federal
and
state
relations
if
the
interference
of
the
government
with
business
and
labor
represented  departure
from
the
old
idea
of
the
less
government
the
better
what
can
be
said
of  large
body
of
laws
affecting
the
rights
of
states
the
prohibition
of
child
labor
everywhere
was
one
indication
of
the
new
tendency
mr
wilson
had
once
declared
such
legislation
unconstitutional
the
supreme
court
declared
it
unconstitutional
but
congress
undaunted
carried
it
into
effect
under
the
guise
of  tax
on
goods
made
by
children
below
the
age
limit
there
were
other
indications
of
the
drift
large
sums
of
money
were
appropriated
by
congress
in
to
assist
the
states
in
building
and
maintaining
highways
the
same
year
the
farm
loan
act
projected
the
federal
government
into
the
sphere
of
local
money
lending
in
millions
of
dollars
were
granted
to
states
in
aid
of
vocational
education
incidentally
imposing
uniform
standards
throughout
the
country
evidently
the
government
was
no
longer
limited
to
the
duties
of
the
policeman
the
prohibition
amendment  still
more
significant
form
of
intervention
in
state
affairs
was
the
passage
in
december
of
an
amendment
to
the
federal
constitution
establishing
national
prohibition
of
the
manufacture
and
sale
of
intoxicating
liquors
as
beverages
this
was
the
climax
of  historical
movement
extending
over
half  century
in  national
prohibition
party
launched
three
years
before
nominated
its
first
presidential
candidate
and
inaugurated  campaign
of
agitation
though
its
vote
was
never
large
the
cause
for
which
it
stood
found
increasing
favor
among
the
people
state
after
state
by
popular
referendum
abolished
the
liquor
traffic
within
its
borders
by
at
least
thirty
two
of
the
forty
eight
were
dry
when
the
federal
amendment
was
submitted
for
approval
the
ratification
was
surprisingly
swift
in  little
more
than  year
namely
on
january
it
was
proclaimed
twelve
months
later
the
amendment
went
into
effect
colonial
and
foreign
policies
the
philippines
and
porto
rico
independence
for
the
philippines
and
larger
self
government
for
porto
rico
had
been
among
the
policies
of
the
democratic
party
since
the
campaign
of
president
wilson
in
his
annual
messages
urged
upon
congress
more
autonomy
for
the
filipinos
and  definite
promise
of
final
independence
the
result
was
the
jones
organic
act
for
the
philippines
passed
in
this
measure
provided
that
the
upper
as
well
as
the
lower
house
of
the
philippine
legislature
should
be
elected
by
popular
vote
and
declared
it
to
be
the
intention
of
the
united
states
to
grant
independence
as
soon
as  stable
government
can
be
established
this
said
president
wilson
on
signing
the
bill
is  very
satisfactory
advance
in
our
policy
of
extending
to
them
self
government
and
control
of
their
own
affairs
the
following
year
congress
yielding
to
president
wilson  insistence
passed  new
organic
act
for
porto
rico
making
both
houses
of
the
legislature
elective
and
conferring
american
citizenship
upon
the
inhabitants
of
the
island
illustration
the
caribbean
region
american
power
in
the
caribbean
while
extending
more
self
government
to
its
dominions
the
united
states
enlarged
its
sphere
of
influence
in
the
caribbean
the
supervision
of
finances
in
santo
domingo
inaugurated
in
roosevelt  administration
was
transformed
into  protectorate
under
wilson
in
dissensions
in
the
republic
led
to
the
landing
of
american
marines
to
supervise
the
elections
two
years
later
an
officer
in
the
american
navy
with
authority
from
washington
placed
the
entire
republic
in  state
of
military
occupation

proceeded
to

it
resigned
the
next
year
after
making  plea
for
the
restoration
of
independence
to
the
republic
for
all
practical
purposes
it
seemed
the
sovereignty
of
santo
domingo
had
been
transferred
to
the
united
states
in
the
neighboring
republic
of
haiti  similar
state
of
affairs
existed
in
the
summer
of  revolution
broke
out
there
one
of  long
series
beginning
in
and
our
marines
were
landed
to
restore
order
elections
were
held
under
the
supervision
of
american
officers
and  treaty
was
drawn
up
placing
the
management
of
haitian
finances
and
the
local
constabulary
under
american
authority
in
taking
this
action
our
secretary
of
state
was
careful
to
announce
the
united
states
government
has
no
purpose
of
aggression
and
is
entirely
disinterested
in
promoting
this
protectorate
still
it
must
be
said
that
there
were
vigorous
protests
on
the
part
of
natives
and
american
citizens
against
the
conduct
of
our
agents
in
the
island
in
president
wilson
was
considering
withdrawal
in
line
with
american
policy
in
the
west
indian
waters
was
the
purchase
in
of
the
danish
islands
just
off
the
coast
of
porto
rico
the
strategic
position
of
the
islands
especially
in
relation
to
haiti
and
porto
rico
made
them
an
object
of
american
concern
as
early
as
when  treaty
of
purchase
was
negotiated
only
to
be
rejected
by
the
senate
of
the
united
states
in  second
arrangement
was
made
but
this
time
it
was
defeated
by
the
upper
house
of
the
danish
parliament
the
third
treaty
brought
an
end
to
fifty
years
of
bargaining
and
the
stars
and
stripes
were
raised
over
st
croix
st
thomas
st
john
and
numerous
minor
islands
scattered
about
in
the
neighborhood

would
be
suicidal

or
an

be
erected
by
her
rivals
at

american
power
was
strengthened
by
the
establishment
of  protectorate
over

in
mexican
relations
the
extension
of
american
enterprise
southward
into
latin
america
of
which
the
operations
in
the
caribbean
regions
were
merely
one
phase
naturally
carried
americans
into
mexico
to
develop
the
natural
resources
of
that
country
under
the
iron
rule
of
general
porfirio
diaz
established
in
and
maintained
with
only  short
break
until
mexico
had
become
increasingly
attractive
to
our
business
men
on
the
invitation
of
president
diaz
they
had
invested
huge
sums
in
mexican
lands
oil
fields
and
mines
and
had
laid
the
foundations
of  new
industrial
order
the
severe
regime
instituted
by
diaz
however
stirred
popular
discontent
the
peons
or
serfs
demanded
the
break
up
of
the
great
estates
some
of
which
had
come
down
from
the
days
of
cortez
their
clamor
for
the
restoration
of
the
land
to
the
people
could
not
be
silenced
in
diaz
was
forced
to
resign
and
left

down

path
to

hailed
for  time
as

murder
he
was
accused
of
instigating

and
nearly
all
the
powers
of

accepted
the

as
lawful
the

leaving
the

for
six
years
the

recognized
by

position
which
he
vigorously
strove

was
deposed
and
murdered
and
another

these
events
right
at
our
door
could
not
fail
to
involve
the
government
of
the
united
states
in
the
disorders
many
american
citizens
lost
their
lives
american
property
was
destroyed
and

was
confiscated  new

at

moreover
the

was
in
constant
turmoil
even
in

administration
mr

felt
compelled
to
issue  solemn
warning
to
the
mexican
government
protesting
against

violation
of
american
rights
president
wilson
soon
after
his
inauguration
sent  commissioner
to
mexico
to
inquire
into
the
situation
although
he
declared  general
policy
of
watchful
waiting
he
twice
came
to
blows
with
mexican
forces
in
some
american
sailors
at
tampico
were
arrested
by  mexican
officer
the
mexican
government
although
it
immediately
released
the
men
refused
to
make
the
required
apology
for
the
incident
as  result
president
wilson
ordered
the
landing
of
american
forces
at
vera
cruz
and
the
occupation
of
the
city  clash
of
arms
followed
in
which
several
americans
were
killed
war
seemed
inevitable
but
at
this
juncture
the
governments
of
argentina
brazil
and
chile
tendered
their
good
offices
as
mediators
after  few
weeks
of
negotiation
during
which
huerta
was
forced
out
of
power
american
forces
were
withdrawn
from
vera
cruz
and
the
incident
closed
in  second
break
in
amicable
relations

in
the
spring
of
that
year  band
of

against
the
protests
of

american
forces
penetrated
deeply
into
mexico
without
effecting
the
object
of
the
undertaking
this
operation
lasted
until
january
when
the
imminence
of
war
with
germany
led
to
the
withdrawal
of
the
american
soldiers
friendly
relations
were
resumed
with
the
mexican
government
and
the
policy
of
watchful
waiting
was
continued

states
and
the
european
war
the
outbreak
of
the
war
in
the
opening
days
of
august
the
age
long
jealousies
of
european
nations
sharpened
by
new
imperial
ambitions
broke
out
in
another
general
conflict
such
as
had
shaken
the
world
in
the
days
of
napoleon
on
june
the
heir
to
the
austro
hungarian
throne
was
assassinated
at
serajevo
the
capital
of
bosnia
an
austrian
province
occupied
mainly
by
serbs
with  view
to
stopping
serbian
agitation
for
independence
austria
hungary
laid
the
blame
for
this
incident
on
the
government
of
serbia
and
made
humiliating
demands
on
that
country
germany
at
once
proposed
that
the
issue
should
be
regarded
as
an
affair
which
should
be
settled
solely
between
austria
hungary
and
serbia
meaning
that
the
small
nation
should
be
left
to
the
tender
mercies
of  great
power
russia
refused
to
take
this
view
great
britain
proposed  settlement
by
mediation
germany
backed
up
austria
to
the
limit
to
use
the
language
of
the
german
authorities
we
were
perfectly
aware
that  possible
warlike
attitude
of
austria
hungary
against
serbia
might
bring
russia
upon
the
field
and
that
it
might
therefore
involve
us
in  war
in
accordance
with
our
duties
as
allies
we
could
not
however
in
these
vital
interests
of
austria
hungary
which
were
at
stake
advise
our
ally
to
take  yielding
attitude
not
compatible
with
his
dignity
nor
deny
him
our
assistance
that
made
the
war
inevitable
every
day
of
the
fateful
august
was
crowded
with
momentous
events
on
the
st
germany
declared
war
on
russia
on
the  the
germans
invaded
the
little
duchy
of
luxemburg
and
notified
the
king
of
belgium
that
they
were
preparing
to
violate
the
neutrality
of
his
realm
on
their
way
to
paris
on
the
same
day
great
britain
anxiously
besought
by
the
french
government
promised
the
aid
of
the
british
navy
if
german
warships
made
hostile
demonstrations
in
the
channel
august  the
german
government
declared
war
on
france
the
following
day
great
britain
demanded
of
germany
respect
for
belgian
neutrality
and
failing
to
receive
the
guarantee
broke
off
diplomatic
relations
on
the
th
the
british
prime
minister
announced
that
war
had
opened
between
england
and
germany
the
storm
now
broke
in
all
its
pitiless
fury
the
state
of
american
opinion
although
president
wilson
promptly
proclaimed
the
neutrality
of
the
united
states
the
sympathies
of  large
majority
of
the
american
people
were
without
doubt
on
the
side
of
great
britain
and
france
to
them
the
invasion
of
the
little
kingdom
of
belgium
and
the
horrors
that
accompanied
german
occupation
were
odious
in
the
extreme
moreover
they
regarded
the
german
imperial
government
as
an
autocratic
power
wielded
in
the
interest
of
an
ambitious
military
party
the
kaiser
william
ii
and
the
crown
prince
were
the
symbols
of
royal
arrogance
on
the
other
hand
many
americans
of
german
descent
in
memory
of
their
ties
with
the
fatherland
openly
sympathized
with
the
central
powers
and
many
americans
of
irish
descent
recalling
their
long
and
bitter
struggle
for
home
rule
in
ireland
would
have
regarded
british
defeat
as  merited
redress
of
ancient
grievances
extremely
sensitive
to
american
opinion
but
ill
informed
about
it
the
german
government
soon
began
systematic
efforts
to
present
its
cause
to
the
people
of
the
united
states
in
the
most
favorable
light
possible
dr
bernhard
dernburg
the
former
colonial
secretary
of
the
german
empire
was
sent
to
america
as  special
agent
for
months
he
filled
the
newspapers
magazines
and
periodicals
with
interviews
articles
and
notes
on
the
justice
of
the
teutonic
cause
from  press
bureau
in
new
york
flowed  stream
of
pamphlets
leaflets
and
cartoons  magazine
the
fatherland
was
founded
to
secure
fair
play
for
germany
and
austria
several
professors
in
american
universities
who
had
received
their
training
in
germany
took
up
the
pen
in
defense
of
the
central
empires
the
german
language
press
without
exception
it
seems
the
national
german
alliance
minor
german
societies
and
lutheran
churches
came
to
the
support
of
the
german
cause
even
the
english
language
papers
though
generally
favorable
to
the
entente
allies
opened
their
columns
in
the
interest
of
equal
justice
to
the
spokesmen
for
all
the
contending
powers
of
europe
before
two
weeks
had
elapsed
the
controversy
had
become
so
intense
that
president
wilson
august
was
moved
to
caution
his
countrymen
against
falling
into
angry
disputes
every
man
he
said
who
really
loves
america
will
act
and
speak
in
the
true
spirit
of
neutrality
which
is
the
spirit
of
impartiality
and
fairness
and
friendliness
to
all
concerned
we
must
be
impartial
in
thought
as
well
as
in
action
must
put  curb
upon
our
sentiments
as
well
as
upon
every
transaction
that
might
be
construed
as  preference
of
one
party
to
the
struggle
before
another
the
clash
over
american
trade
as
in
the
time
of
the
napoleonic
wars
the
conflict
in
europe
raised
fundamental
questions
respecting
rights
of
americans
trading
with
countries
at
peace
as
well
as
those
at
war
on
this
point
there
existed
on
august  fairly
definite
body
of
principles
by
which
nations
were
bound
among
them
the
following
were
of
vital
significance
in
the
first
place
it
was
recognized
that
an
enemy
merchant
ship
caught
on
the
high
seas
was  legitimate
prize
of
war
which
might
be
seized
and
confiscated
in
the
second
place
it
was
agreed
that
contraband
of
war
found
on
an
enemy
or
neutral
ship
was  lawful
prize
any
ship
suspected
of
carrying
it
was
liable
to
search
and
if
caught
with
forbidden
goods
was
subject
to
seizure
in
the
third
place
international
law
prescribed
that  peaceful
merchant
ship
whether
belonging
to
an
enemy
or
to  neutral
country
should
not
be
destroyed
or
sunk
without
provision
for
the
safety
of
crew
and
passengers
in
the
fourth
place
it
was
understood
that  belligerent
had
the
right
if
it
could
to
blockade
the
ports
of
an
enemy
and
prevent
the
ingress
and
egress
of
all
ships
but
such  blockade
to
be
lawful
had
to
be
effective
these
general
principles
left
undetermined
two
important
matters
what
is
an
effective
blockade
and
what
is
contraband
of
war
the
task
of
answering
these
questions
fell
to
great
britain
as
mistress
of
the
seas
although
the
german
submarines
made
it
impossible
for
her
battleships
to
maintain  continuous
patrol
of
the
waters
in
front
of
blockaded
ports
she
declared
the
blockade
to
be
none
the
less
effective
because
her
navy
was
supreme
as
to
contraband
of
war
great
britain
put
such  broad
interpretation
upon
the
term
as
to
include
nearly
every
important
article
of
commerce
early
in
she
declared
even
cargoes
of
grain
and
flour
to
be
contraband
defending
the
action
on
the
ground
that
the
german
government
had
recently
taken
possession
of
all
domestic
stocks
of
corn
wheat
and
flour  new
question
arose
in
connection
with
american
trade
with
the
neutral
countries
surrounding
germany
great
britain
early
began
to
intercept
ships
carrying
oil
gasoline
and
copper
all
war
materials
of
prime
importance
on
the
ground
that
they
either
were
destined
ultimately
to
germany
or
would
release
goods
for
sale
to
germans
on
november
the
english
government
announced
that
the
germans
wore
sowing
mines
in
open
waters
and
that
therefore
the
whole
of
the
north
sea
was  military
zone
ships
bound
for
denmark
norway
and
sweden
were
ordered
to
come
by
the
english
channel
for
inspection
and
sailing
directions
in
effect
americans
were
now
licensed
by
great
britain
to
trade
in
certain
commodities
and
in
certain
amounts
with
neutral
countries
against
these
extraordinary
measures
the
state
department
at
washington
lodged
pointed
objections
saying
this
government
is
reluctantly
forced
to
the
conclusion
that
the
present
policy
of
his
majesty  government
toward
neutral
ships
and
cargoes
exceeds
the
manifest
necessity
of  belligerent
and
constitutes
restrictions
upon
the
rights
of
american
citizens
on
the
high
seas
which
are
not
justified
by
the
rules
of
international
law
or
required
under
the
principle
of
self
preservation
germany
begins
the
submarine
campaign
germany
now
announced
that
on
and
after
february
the
whole
of
the
english
channel
and
the
waters
around
great
britain
would
be
deemed  war
zone
and
that
every
enemy
ship
found
therein
would
be
destroyed
the
german
decree
added
that
as
the
british
admiralty
had
ordered
the
use
of
neutral
flags
by
english
ships
in
time
of
distress
neutral
vessels
would
be
in
danger
of
destruction
if
found
in
the
forbidden
area
it
was
clear
that
germany
intended
to
employ
submarines
to
destroy
shipping  new
factor
was
thus
introduced
into
naval
warfare
one
not
provided
for
in
the
accepted
laws
of
war  warship
overhauling  merchant
vessel
could
easily
take
its
crew
and
passengers
on
board
for
safe
keeping
as
prescribed
by
international
law
but  submarine
ordinarily
could
do
nothing
of
the
sort
of
necessity
the
lives
and
the
ships
of
neutrals
as
well
as
of
belligerents
were
put
in
mortal
peril
this
amazing
conduct
germany
justified
on
the
ground
that
it
was
mere
retaliation
against
great
britain
for
her
violations
of
international
law
the
response
of
the
united
states
to
the
ominous
german
order
was
swift
and
direct
on
february
it
warned
germany
that
if
her
commanders
destroyed
american
lives
and
ships
in
obedience
to
that
decree
the
action
would
be
very
hard
indeed
to
reconcile
with
the
friendly
relations
happily
subsisting
between
the
two
governments
the
american
note
added
that
the
german
imperial
government
would
be
held
to
strict
accountability
and
all
necessary
steps
would
be
taken
to
safeguard
american
lives
and
american
rights
this
was
firm
and
clear
language
but
the
only
response
which
it
evoked
from
germany
was  suggestion
that
if
great
britain
would
allow
food
supplies
to
pass
through
the
blockade
the
submarine
campaign
would
be
dropped
violations
of
american
rights
meanwhile
germany
continued
to
ravage
shipping
on
the
high
seas
on
january  german
raider
sank
the
american
ship
william  frye
in
the
south
atlantic
on
march  british
ship
the
falaba
was
sunk
by  submarine
and
many
on
board
including
an
american
citizen
were
killed
and
on
april  german
airplane
dropped
bombs
on
the
american
steamer
cushing
on
the
morning
of
may
americans
were
astounded
to
see
in
the
newspapers
an
advertisement
signed
by
the
german
imperial
embassy
warning
travelers
of
the
dangers
in
the
war
zone
and
notifying
them
that
any
who
ventured
on
british
ships
into
that
area
did
so
at
their
own
risk
on
that
day
the
lusitania  british
steamer
sailed
from
new
york
for
liverpool
on
may
without
warning
the
ship
was
struck
by
two
torpedoes
and
in  few
minutes
went
down
by
the
bow
carrying
to
death
persons
including
american
men
women
and
children  cry
of
horror
ran
through
the
country
the
german
papers
in
america
and  few
american
people
argued
that
american
citizens
had
been
duly
warned
of
the
danger
and
had
deliberately
taken
their
lives
into
their
own
hands
but
the
terrible
deed
was
almost
universally
condemned
by
public
opinion
the
lusitania
notes
on
may
the
department
of
state
at
washington
made
public
the
first
of
three
famous
notes
on
the
lusitania
case
it
solemnly
informed
the
german
government
that
no
warning
that
an
unlawful
and
inhumane
act
will
be
committed
can
possibly
be
accepted
as
an
excuse
or
palliation
for
that
act
or
as
an
abatement
of
the
responsibility
for
its
commission
it
called
upon
the
german
government
to
disavow
the
act
make
reparation
as
far
as
possible
and
take
steps
to
prevent
the
recurrence
of
anything
so
obviously
subversive
of
the
principles
of
warfare
the
note
closed
with  clear
caution
to
germany
that
the
government
of
the
united
states
would
not
omit
any
word
or
any
act
necessary
to
the
performance
of
its
sacred
duty
of
maintaining
the
rights
of
the
united
states
and
its
citizens
and
of
safeguarding
their
free
exercise
and
enjoyment
the
die
was
cast
but
germany
in
reply
merely
temporized
in  second
note
made
public
on
june
the
position
of
the
united
states
was
again
affirmed
william
jennings
bryan
the
secretary
of
state
had
resigned
because
the
drift
of
president
wilson  policy
was
not
toward
mediation
but
the
strict
maintenance
of
american
rights
if
need
be
by
force
of
arms
the
german
reply
was
still
evasive
and
german
naval
commanders
continued
their
course
of
sinking
merchant
ships
in  third
and
final
note
of
july
president
wilson
made
it
clear
to
germany
that
he
meant
what
he
said
when
he
wrote
that
he
would
maintain
the
rights
of
american
citizens
finally
after
much
discussion
and
shifting
about
the
german
ambassador
on
september
sent  brief
note
to
the
secretary
of
state
liners
will
not
be
sunk
by
our
submarines
without
warning
and
without
safety
of
the
lives
of
non
combatants
provided
the
liners
do
not
try
to
escape
or
offer
resistance
editorially
the
new
york
times
declared
it
is  triumph
not
only
of
diplomacy
but
of
reason
of
humanity
of
justice
and
of
truth
the
secretary
of
state
saw
in
it  recognition
of
the
fundamental
principles
for
which
we
have
contended
the
presidential
election
of
in
the
midst
of
this
crisis
came
the
presidential
campaign
on
the
republican
side
everything
seemed
to
depend
upon
the
action
of
the
progressives
if
the
breach
created
in
could
be
closed
victory
was
possible
if
not
defeat
was
certain  promise
of
unity
lay
in
the
fact
that
the
conventions
of
the
republicans
and
progressives
were
held
simultaneously
in
chicago
the
friends
of
roosevelt
hoped
that
both
parties
would
select
him
as
their
candidate
but
this
hope
was
not
realized
the
republicans
chose
and
the
progressives
accepted
charles  hughes
an
associate
justice
of
the
federal
supreme
court
who
as
governor
of
new
york
had
won  national
reputation
by
waging
war
on
machine
politicians
in
the
face
of
the
clamor
for
expressions
of
sympathy
with
one
or
the
other
of
the
contending
powers
of
europe
the
republicans
chose  middle
course
declaring
that
they
would
uphold
all
american
rights
at
home
and
abroad
by
land
and
by
sea
this
sentiment
mr
hughes
echoed
in
his
acceptance
speech
by
some
it
was
interpreted
to
mean  firmer
policy
in
dealing
with
great
britain
by
others  more
vigorous
handling
of
the
submarine
menace
the
democrats
on
their
side
renominated
president
wilson
by
acclamation
reviewed
with
pride
the
legislative
achievements
of
the
party
and
commended
the
splendid
diplomatic
victories
of
our
great
president
who
has
preserved
the
vital
interests
of
our
government
and
its
citizens
and
kept
us
out
of
war
in
the
election
which
ensued
president
wilson  popular
vote
exceeded
that
cast
for
mr
hughes
by
more
than
half  million
while
his
electoral
vote
stood
to
the
result
was
regarded
and
not
without
warrant
as  great
personal
triumph
for
the
president
he
had
received
the
largest
vote
yet
cast
for  presidential
candidate
the
progressive
party
practically
disappeared
and
the
socialists
suffered  severe
set
back
falling
far
behind
the
vote
of
president
wilson
urges
peace
upon
the
warring
nations
apparently
convinced
that
his
pacific
policies
had
been
profoundly
approved
by
his
countrymen
president
wilson
soon
after
the
election
addressed
peace
notes
to
the
european
belligerents
on
december
the
german
emperor
proposed
to
the
allied
powers
that
they
enter
into
peace
negotiations  suggestion
that
was
treated
as  mere
political
maneuver
by
the
opposing
governments
two
days
later
president
wilson
sent  note
to
the
warring
nations
asking
them
to
avow
the
terms
upon
which
war
might
be
concluded
to
these
notes
the
central
powers
replied
that
they
were
ready
to
meet
their
antagonists
in  peace
conference
and
allied
powers
answered
by
presenting
certain
conditions
precedent
to  satisfactory
settlement
on
january
president
wilson
in
an
address
before
the
senate
declared
it
to
be  duty
of
the
united
states
to
take
part
in
the
establishment
of  stable
peace
on
the
basis
of
certain
principles
these
were
in
short
peace
without
victory
the
right
of
nationalities
to
freedom
and
self
government
the
independence
of
poland
freedom
of
the
seas
the
reduction
of
armaments
and
the
abolition
of
entangling
alliances
the
whole
world
was
discussing
the
president  remarkable
message
when
it
was
dumbfounded
to
hear
on
january
that
the
german
ambassador
at
washington
had
announced
the
official
renewal
of
ruthless
submarine
warfare
the
united
states
at
war
steps
toward
war
three
days
after
the
receipt
of
the
news
that
the
german
government
intended
to
return
to
its
former
submarine
policy
president
wilson
severed
diplomatic
relations
with
the
german
empire
at
the
same
time
he
explained
to
congress
that
he
desired
no
conflict
with
germany
and
would
await
an
overt
act
before
taking
further
steps
to
preserve
american
rights
god
grant
he
concluded
that
we
may
not
be
challenged
to
defend
them
by
acts
of
willful
injustice
on
the
part
of
the
government
of
germany
yet
the
challenge
came
between
february
and
april
six
american
merchant
vessels
were
torpedoed
in
most
cases
without
any
warning
and
without
regard
to
the
loss
of
american
lives
president
wilson
therefore
called
upon
congress
to
answer
the
german
menace
the
reply
of
congress
on
april
was  resolution
passed
with
only  few
dissenting
votes
declaring
the
existence
of  state
of
war
with
germany
austria
hungary
at
once
severed
diplomatic
relations
with
the
united
states
but
it
was
not
until
december
that
congress
acting
on
the
president  advice
declared
war
also
on
that
vassal
of
the
german
government
american
war
aims
in
many
addresses
at
the
beginning
and
during
the
course
of
the
war
president
wilson
stated
the
purposes
which
actuated
our
government
in
taking
up
arms
he
first
made
it
clear
that
it
was  war
of
self
defense
the
military
masters
of
germany
he
exclaimed
denied
us
the
right
to
be
neutral
proof
of
that
lay
on
every
hand
agents
of
the
german
imperial
government
had
destroyed
american
lives
and
american
property
on
the
high
seas
they
had
filled
our
communities
with
spies
they
had
planted
bombs
in
ships
and
munition
works
they
had
fomented
divisions
among
american
citizens
though
assailed
in
many
ways
and
compelled
to
resort
to
war
the
united
states
sought
no
material
rewards
the
world
must
be
made
safe
for
democracy
its
peace
must
be
planted
upon
the
tested
foundations
of
political
liberty
we
have
no
selfish
ends
to
serve
we
desire
no
conquest
no
dominion
we
seek
no
indemnities
for
ourselves
in  very
remarkable
message
read
to
congress
on
january
president
wilson
laid
down
his
famous
fourteen
points
summarizing
the
ideals
for
which
we
were
fighting
they
included
open
treaties
of
peace
openly
arrived
at
absolute

and
an
association
of

to
afford
mutual
guarantees
to
all

great
and
small
on  later
occasion
president
wilson
elaborated
the
last
point
namely
the
formation
of  league
of
nations
to
guarantee
peace
and
establish
justice
among
the
powers
of
the
world
democracy
the
right
of
nations
to
determine
their
own
fate  covenant
of
enduring
peace
these
were
the
ideals
for
which
the
american
people
were
to
pour
out
their
blood
and
treasure
the
selective
draft
the
world
war
became  war
of
nations
the
powers
against
which
we
were
arrayed
had
every
able
bodied
man
in
service
and
all
their
resources
human
and
material
thrown
into
the
scale
for
this
reason
president
wilson
summoned
the
whole
people
of
the
united
states
to
make
every
sacrifice
necessary
for
victory
congress
by
law
decreed
that
the
national
army
should
be
chosen
from
all
male
citizens
and
males
not
enemy
aliens
who
had
declared
their
intention
of
becoming
citizens
by
the
first
act
of
may
it
fixed
the
age
limits
at
twenty
one
to
thirty
one
inclusive
later
in
august
it
extended
them
to
eighteen
and
forty
five
from
the
men
of
the
first
group
so
enrolled
were
chosen
by
lot
the
soldiers
for
the
world
war
who
with
the
regular
army
and
the
national
guard
formed
the
american
expeditionary
force
upholding
the
american
cause
on
the
battlefields
of
europe
the
whole
nation
said
the
president
must
be  team
in
which
each
man
shall
play
the
part
for
which
he
is
best
fitted
liberty
loans
and
taxes
in
order
that
the
military
and
naval
forces
should
be
stinted
in
no
respect
the
nation
was
called
upon
to
place
its
financial
resources
at
the
service
of
the
government
some
urged
the
conscription
of
wealth
as
well
as
men
meaning
the
support
of
the
war
out
of
taxes
upon
great
fortunes
but
more
conservative
counsels
prevailed
four
great
liberty
loans
were
floated
all
the
agencies
of
modern
publicity
being
employed
to
enlist
popular
interest
the
first
loan
had
four
and  half
million
subscribers
the
fourth
more
than
twenty
million
combined
with
loans
were
heavy
taxes  progressive
tax
was
laid
upon
incomes
beginning
with
four
per
cent
on
incomes
in
the
lower
ranges
and
rising
to
sixty
three
per
cent
of
that
part
of
any
income
above  progressive
tax
was
levied
upon
inheritances
an
excess
profits
tax
was
laid
upon
all
corporations

partnerships
rising
in
amount
to
sixty
per
cent
of
the
net
income
in
excess
of
thirty
three
per
cent
on
the
invested
capital
this
said  distinguished
economist
is
the
high
water
mark
in
the
history
of
taxation
never
before
in
the
annals
of
civilization
has
an
attempt
been
made
to
take
as
much
as
two
thirds
of  man  income
by
taxation
mobilizing
material
resources
no
stone
was
left
unturned
to
provide
the

and
transportation
required
in
the
gigantic
undertaking
between
the

of

gave
the

to
fix

to
take
almost
any
steps
necessary

prevent

by  series
of
measures
enlarging
the
principles
of
the

taken
such  wise
and
humane
view
of
its
obligations
to
those
who

or
on

and
the

known
as

vigorous
opposition
in
the
senate
where
twenty
four
republicans
and
two
democrats
voted
against
it
senator
johnson
of
california
denounced
it
as  law
to
suppress
the
freedom
of

to
prevent

no
matter
who
he
is

in
view
of
the
restlessness
of
european
labor
during
the
war
and
especially
the
proletarian
revolution
in
russia
in
november
some
anxiety
was
early
expressed
as
to
the
stand
which
organized
labor
might
take
in
the
united
states
it
was
however
soon
dispelled
samuel
gompers
speaking
for
the
american
federation
of
labor
declared
that
this
is
labor  war
and
pledged
the
united
support
of
all
the
unions
there
was
some
dissent
the
socialist
party
denounced
the
war
as  capitalist
quarrel
but
all
the
protests
combined
were
too
slight
to
have
much
effect
american
labor
leaders
were
sent
to
europe
to
strengthen
the
wavering
ranks
of
trade
unionists
in
war
worn
england
france
and
italy
labor
was
given
representation
on
the
important
boards
and
commissions
dealing
with
industrial
questions
trade
union
standards
were
accepted
by
the
government
and
generally
applied
in
industry
the
department
of
labor
became
one
of
the
powerful
war
centers
of
the
nation
in  memorable
address
to
the
american
federation
of
labor
president
wilson
assured
the
trade
unionists
that
labor
conditions
should
not
be
made
unduly
onerous
by
the
war
and
received
in
return  pledge
of
loyalty
from
the
federation
recognition
of
labor  contribution
to
winning
the
war
was
embodied
in
the
treaty
of

which
provided
for  permanent
international
organization
to

wide
effort
of
labor
to
improve
social
conditions
the
league
of
nations
has
for
its
object
the
establishment
of
universal
peace
runs
the
preamble
to
the
labor
section
of
the
treaty
and
such  peace
can
be
established
only
if
it
is
based
upon
social
justice
the
failure
of
any
nation
to
adopt
humane
conditions
of
labor
is
an
obstacle
in
the
way
of
other
nations
which
desire
to
improve
the
conditions
in
their
own
countries
the
american
navy
in
the
war
as
soon
as
congress
declared
war
the
fleet
was
mobilized
american
ports
were
thrown
open
to
the
warships
of
the
allies
immediate
provision
was
made
for
increasing
the
number
of
men
and
ships
and  contingent
of

vessels
was
sent
to
cooperate
with
the
british
and
french

special
effort
was
made
to
stimulate
the

convoys
were
provided
to

before
the
end
of
the

more
than
three
hundred
american
vessels
and
officers
and
men
were
operating
in
european

though
the
german
fleet
failed
to
come
out
and
challenge
the
sea
power
of
the
allies
the
battleships
of
the
united
states
were
always
ready
to
do
their
full
duty
in
such
an
event
as
things
turned
out
the
service
of
the
american
navy
was
limited
mainly
to
helping
in
the
campaign
that
wore
down
the
submarine
menace
to
allied
shipping
the
war
in
france
owing
to
the
peculiar
character
of
the
warfare
in
france
it
required  longer
time
for
american
military
forces
to
get
into
action
but
there
was
no
unnecessary
delay
soon
after
the
declaration
of
war
steps
were
taken
to
give
military
assistance
to
the
allies
the

as
soon
as
the

enrolled
under
the

were
ready
it
became  flood
during
the
period
of
the

the
army
was
enlarged
from
about
men
to
of
whom
more
than
were
in
france
when
the
armistice
was
signed
although
american
troops
did
not
take
part
on  large
scale
until

of
the

nothing

save

five
days

the
end
came
on

should
be
placed

arose
in

it
was
this
arrangement
that
led

delegation
to
withhold
their
signatures
from
the
treaty
the
league
of
nations
high
among
the
purposes
which
he
had
in
mind
in
summoning
the
nation
to
arms
president
wilson
placed
the
desire
to
put
an
end
to
war
all
through
the
united
states
the
people
spoke
of
the
war
to
end
war
no
slogan
called
forth  deeper
response
from
the
public
the
president
himself
repeatedly
declared
that  general
association
of
nations
must
be
formed
to
guard
the
peace
and
protect
all
against
the
ambitions
of
the
few
as  see
it
he
said
in
his
address
on
opening
the
fourth
liberty
loan
campaign
the
constitution
of
the
league
of
nations
and
the
clear
definition
of
its
objects
must
be  part
in  sense
the
most
essential
part
of
the
peace
settlement
itself
nothing
was
more
natural
therefore
than
wilson  insistence
at
paris
upon
the
formation
of
an
international
association
indeed
he
had
gone
to
europe
in
person
largely
to
accomplish
that
end
part
one
of
the
treaty
with
germany
the
covenant
of
the
league
of
nations
was
due
to
his
labors
more
than
to
any
other
influence
within
the
league
thus
created
were
to
be
embraced
all
the
allied
and
associated
powers
and
nearly
all
the
neutrals
by  two
thirds
vote
of
the
league
assembly
the
excluded
nations
might
be
admitted
the
agencies
of
the
league
of
nations
were
to
be
three
in
number  permanent

located
at
geneva

assembly
consisting

one
delegate
from
each
country
dominion
or
self
governing

including

and  council
consisting
of

states
great
britain
france
italy
and
japan
and
four
other
representatives
selected
by
the
assembly
from
time
to
time
the
duties
imposed
on
the
league
and
the
obligations
accepted
by
its
members
were
numerous
and
important
the
council
was
to
take
steps
to
formulate  scheme
for
the
reduction
of
armaments
and
to
submit  plan
for
the
establishment
of  permanent
court
of
international
justice
the
members
of
the
league
article  were
to
respect
and
preserve
as
against
external
aggression
the
territorial
integrity
and
existing
political
independence
of
all
the
associated
nations
they
were
to
submit
to
arbitration
or
inquiry
by
the
council
all
disputes
which
could
not
be
adjusted
by
diplomacy
and
in
no
case
to
resort
to
war
until
three
months
after
the
award
should
any
member
disregard
its
covenants
its
action
would
be
considered
an
act
of
war
against
the
league
which
would
accordingly
cut
off
the
trade
and
business
of
the
hostile
member
and
recommend
through
the
council
to
the
several
associated
governments
the
military
measures
to
be
taken
in
case
the
decision
in
any
arbitration
of  dispute
was
unanimous
the
members
of
the
league
affected
by
it
were
to
abide
by
it
such
was
the
settlement
at
paris
and
such
was
the
association
of
nations
formed
to
promote
the
peace
of
the
world
they
were
quickly
approved
by
most
of
the
powers
and
the
first
assembly
of
the
league
of
nations
met
at
geneva
late
in
the
treaty
in
the
united
states
when
the
treaty
was
presented
to
the
united
states
senate
for
approval  violent
opposition
appeared
in
that
chamber
the
republicans
had  slight
majority
and  two
thirds
vote
was
necessary
for
ratification
the
sentiment
for
and
against
the
treaty
ran
mainly
along
party
lines
but
the
republicans
were
themselves
divided
the
major
portion
known
as
reservationists
favored
ratification
with
certain
conditions
respecting
american
rights
while  small
though
active
minority
rejected
the
league
of
nations
in
its
entirety
announcing
themselves
to
be
irreconcilables
the
grounds
of
this
republican
opposition
lay
partly
in
the
terms
of
peace
imposed
on
germany
and
partly
in
the
covenant
of
the
league
of
nations
exception
was
taken
to
the
clauses
which
affected
the
rights
of
american
citizens
in
property
involved
in
the
adjustment
with
germany
but
the
burden
of
criticism
was
directed
against
the
league
article  guaranteeing
against
external
aggression
the
political
independence
and
territorial
integrity
of
the
members
of
the
league
was
subjected
to  specially
heavy
fire
while
the
treatment
accorded
to
china
and
the
sections
affecting
american
internal
affairs
were
likewise
attacked
as
unjust
and
dangerous
as
an
outcome
of
their
deliberations
the
republicans
proposed  long
list
of
reservations
which
touched
upon
many
of
the
vital
parts
of
the
treaty
these
were
rejected
by
president
wilson
as
amounting
in
effect
to  nullification
of
the
treaty
as  deadlock
ensued
the
treaty
was
definitely
rejected
owing
to
the
failure
of
its
sponsors
to
secure
the
requisite
two
thirds
vote
illustration
europe
the
league
of
nations
in
the
campaign
of
at
this
juncture
the
presidential
campaign
of
opened
the
republicans
while
condemning
the
terms
of
the
proposed
league
endorsed
the
general
idea
of
an
international
agreement
to
prevent
war
their
candidate
senator
warren
harding
of
ohio
maintained  similar
position
without
saying
definitely
whether
the
league
devised
at
paris
could
be
recast
in
such  manner
as
to
meet
his
requirements
the
democrats
on
the
other
hand
while
not
opposing
limitations
clarifying
the
obligations
of
the
united
states
demanded
the
immediate
ratification
of
the
treaty
without
reservations
which
would
impair
its
essential
integrity
the
democratic
candidate
governor
james  cox
of
ohio
announced
his
firm
conviction
that
the
united
states
should
go
into
the
league
without
closing
the
door
to
mild
reservations
he
appealed
to
the
country
largely
on
that
issue
the
election
of
senator
harding
in
an
extraordinary
landslide
coupled
with
the
return
of  majority
of
republicans
to
the
senate
made
uncertain
american
participation
in
the
league
of
nations
the
united
states
and
international
entanglements
whether
america
entered
the
league
or
not
it
could
not
close
its
doors
to
the
world
and
escape
perplexing
international
complications
it
had
ever
increasing
financial
and
commercial
connections
with
all
other
countries
our
associates
in
the
recent
war
were
heavily
indebted
to
our
government
the
prosperity
of
american
industries
depended
to  considerable
extent
upon
the
recovery
of
the
impoverished
and
battle
torn
countries
of
europe
there
were
other
complications
no
less
specific
the
united
states
was
compelled
by
force
of
circumstances
to
adopt  russian
policy
the
government
of
the
czar
had
been
overthrown
by  liberal
revolution
which
in
turn
had
been
succeeded
by
an
extreme
communist
dictatorship
the
bolsheviki
or
majority
faction
of
the
socialists
had
obtained
control
of
the
national
council
of
peasants
workingmen
and
soldiers
called
the
soviet
and
inaugurated  radical
regime
they
had
made
peace
with
germany
in
march
thereupon
the
united
states
joined
england
france
and
japan
in
an
unofficial
war
upon
them
after
the
general
settlement
at
paris
in
our
government
while
withdrawing
troops
from
siberia
and
archangel
continued
in
its
refusal
to
recognize
the
bolshevists
or
to
permit
unhampered
trade
with
them
president
wilson
repeatedly
denounced
them
as
the
enemies
of
civilization
and
undertook
to
lay
down
for
all
countries
the
principles
which
should
govern
intercourse
with
russia
further
international
complications
were
created
in
connection
with
the
world
war
wholly
apart
from
the
terms
of
peace
or
the
league
of
nations
the
united
states
had
participated
in  general
european
conflict
which
changed
the
boundaries
of
countries
called
into
being
new
nations
and
reduced
the
power
and
territories
of
the
vanquished
accordingly
it
was
bound
to
face
the
problem
of
how
far
it
was
prepared
to
cooperate
with
the
victors
in
any
settlement
of
europe  difficulties
by
no
conceivable
process
therefore
could
america
be
disentangled
from
the
web
of
world
affairs
isolation
if
desirable
had
become
impossible
within
three
hundred
years
from
the
founding
of
the
tiny
settlements
at
jamestown
and
plymouth
america
by
virtue
of
its
institutions
its
population
its
wealth
and
its
commerce
had
become
first
among
the
nations
of
the
earth
by
moral
obligations
and
by
practical
interests
its
fate
was
thus
linked
with
the
destiny
of
all
mankind
summary
of
democracy
and
the
world
war
the
astounding
industrial
progress
that
characterized
the
period
following
the
civil
war
bequeathed
to
the
new
generation
many
perplexing
problems
connected
with
the
growth
of
trusts
and
railways
the
accumulation
of
great
fortunes
the
increase
of
poverty
in
the
industrial
cities
the
exhaustion
of
the
free
land
and
the
acquisition
of
dominions
in
distant
seas
as
long
as
there
was
an
abundance
of
land
in
the
west
any
able
bodied
man
with
initiative
and
industry
could
become
an
independent
farmer
people
from
the
cities
and
immigrants
from
europe
had
always
before
them
that
gateway
to
property
and
prosperity
when
the
land
was
all
gone
american
economic
conditions
inevitably
became
more
like
those
of
europe
though
the
new
economic
questions
had
been
vigorously
debated
in
many
circles
before
his
day
it
was
president
roosevelt
who
first
discussed
them
continuously
from
the
white
house
the
natural
resources
of
the
country
were
being
exhausted
he
advocated
their
conservation
huge
fortunes
were
being
made
in
business
creating
inequalities
in
opportunity
he
favored
reducing
them
by
income
and
inheritance
taxes
industries
were
disturbed
by
strikes
he
pressed
arbitration
upon
capital
and
labor
the
free
land
was
gone
he
declared
that
labor
was
in  less
favorable
position
to
bargain
with
capital
and
therefore
should
organize
in
unions
for
collective
bargaining
there
had
been
wrong
doing
on
the
part
of
certain
great
trusts
those
responsible
should
be
punished
the
spirit
of
reform
was
abroad
in
the
land
the
spoils
system
was
attacked
it
was
alleged
that
the
political
parties
were
dominated
by
rings
and

the
united

senate
was
called  millionaires
club
poverty
and
misery
were

in

these
and  hundred
other

were
adopted
and

america
improve

the
spirit
of
reform
broke
into
both
political
parties
it
appeared
in
many
statutes
enacted
by
congress
under
president
taft  leadership
it
disrupted
the
republicans
temporarily
in
when
the
progressive
party
entered
the
field
it
led
the
democratic
candidate
in
that
year
governor
wilson
to
make  progressive
appeal
to
the
voters
it
inspired  considerable
program
of
national

administrations
in
the

four
important

equally
great
changes

major
portion
of

passed
into

loomed
upon
the
horizon
their
struggles
their
rights
and
their
place
in
the
economy
of
the

raised
problems
of
the
first
magnitude
while
the
country
was
engaged
in  heated
debate
upon
its
domestic
issues
the
world
war
broke
out
in

in
as  hundred
years
before
american
rights
upon
the
high

became
involved
at
once
they
were
invaded
on
both
sides
but
germany
in
addition
to
assailing
american
ships
and
property
ruthlessly
destroyed
american
lives
she
set
at
naught
the
rules
of
civilized
warfare
upon

warnings
from
president

were
without

nothing
could
stay
the
hand
of
the
german

after
long
and
patient
negotiations
president
wilson
in
called
upon
the
nation
to
take
up
arms
against
an
assailant
that
had
in
effect
declared
war
upon
america
the
answer
was
swift
and
firm
the
national
resources
human
and
material
were
mobilized
the
navy
was
enlarged  draft
army
created
huge
loans
floated
heavy
taxes
laid
and
the
spirit
of
sacrifice
called
forth
in  titanic
struggle
against
an
autocratic
power
that
threatened
to
dominate
europe
and
the
world
in
the
end
american
financial

took
part
in
the

he
sought
to
redeem
his
pledge
to
end

by
forming  league
of
nations
to
keep
the
peace
in
the
treaty
drawn
at
the

was  covenant
binding
the

this
treaty
the
president
offered
to
the

senate
for
ratification
and
to
his
country
for
approval
once
again
as
in
the
days
of
the

in  topical
syllabus
as  result
of  wholesome
reaction
against
the
purely
chronological
treatment
of
history
there
is
now  marked
tendency
in
the
direction
of  purely
topical
handling
of
the
subject
the
topical
method
however
may
also
be
pushed
too
far
each
successive
stage
of
any
topic
can
be
understood
only
in
relation
to
the
forces
of
the
time
for
that
reason
the
best
results
are
reached
when
there
is  combination
of
the
chronological
and
the
topical
methods
it
is
therefore
suggested
that
the
teacher
first
follow
the
text
closely
and
then
review
the
subject
with
the

of
this

preface
to
sixth
edition
much
has
happened
since
this
manual
was
last
revised
and
many
surgical
lessons
have
been
learned
in
the
hard
school
of
war
some
may
yet
have
to
be
unlearned
and
others
have
but
little
bearing
on
the
problems
presented
to
the
civilian
surgeon
save
in
its
broadest
principles
the
surgery
of
warfare
is  thing
apart
from
the
general
surgery
of
civil
life
and
the
exhaustive
literature
now
available
on
every
aspect
of
it
makes
it
unnecessary
that
it
should
receive
detailed
consideration
in  manual
for
students
in
preparing
this
new
edition
therefore
we
have
endeavoured
to
incorporate
only
such
additions
to
our
knowledge
and
resources
as
our
experience
leads
us
to
believe
will
prove
of
permanent
value
in
civil
practice
for
the
rest
the
text
has
been
revised
condensed
and
in
places
rearranged  number
of
old
illustrations
have
been
discarded
and  greater
number
of
new
ones
added
descriptions
of
operative
procedures
have
been
omitted
from
the
manual
as
they
are
to
be
found
in
the
companion
volume
on
operative
surgery
the
third
edition
of
which
appeared
some
months
ago
we
have
retained
the
basle
anatomical
nomenclature
as
extended
experience
has
confirmed
our
preference
for
it
for
the
convenience
of
readers
who
still
employ
the
old
terms
these
are
given
in
brackets
after
the
new
this
edition
of
the
manual
appears
in
three
volumes
the
first
being
devoted
to
general
surgery
the
other
two
to
regional
surgery
this
arrangement
has
enabled
us
to
deal
in  more
consecutive
manner
than
hitherto
with
the
surgery
of
the
extremities
including
fractures
and
dislocations
we
have
once
more
to
express
our
thanks
to
colleagues
in
the
edinburgh
school
and
to
other
friends
for
aiding
us
in
providing
new
illustrations
and
for
other
valuable
help
as
well
as
to

to
prolong
human
life
and
to
alleviate
suffering
are
the
ultimate
objects
of
scientific
medicine
the
two
great
branches
of
the
healing
art
medicine
and
surgery
are
so
intimately
related
that
it
is
impossible
to
draw  hard
and
fast
line
between
them
but
for
convenience
surgery
may
be
defined
as
the
art
of
treating
lesions
and
malformations
of
the
human
body
by
manual
operations
mediate
and
immediate
to
apply
his
art
intelligently
and
successfully
it
is
essential
that
the
surgeon
should
be
conversant
not
only
with
the
normal
anatomy
and
physiology
of
the
body
and
with
the
various
pathological
conditions
to
which
it
is
liable
but
also
with
the
nature
of
the
process
by
which
repair
of
injured
or
diseased
tissues
is
effected
without
this
knowledge
he
is
unable
to
recognise
such
deviations
from
the
normal
as
result
from
mal
development
injury
or
disease
or
rationally
to
direct
his
efforts
towards
the
correction
or
removal
of
these
process
of
repair
the
process
of
repair
in
living
tissue
depends
upon
an
inherent
power
possessed
by
vital
cells
of
reacting
to
the
irritation
caused
by
injury
or
disease
the
cells
of
the
damaged
tissues
under
the
influence
of
this
irritation
undergo
certain
proliferative
changes
which
are
designed
to
restore
the
normal
structure
and
configuration
of
the
part
the
process
by
which
this
restoration
is
effected
is
essentially
the
same
in
all
tissues
but
the
extent
to
which
different
tissues
can
carry
the
recuperative
process
varies
simple
structures
such
as
skin
cartilage
bone
periosteum
and
tendon
for
example
have  high
power
of
regeneration
and
in
them
the
reparative
process
may
result
in
almost
perfect
restitution
to
the
normal
more
complex
structures
on
the
other
hand
such
as
secreting
glands
muscle
and
the
tissues
of
the
central
nervous
system
are
but
imperfectly
restored
simple
cicatricial
connective
tissue
taking
the
place
of
what
has
been
lost
or
destroyed
any
given
tissue
can
be
replaced
only
by
tissue
of  similar
kind
and
in  damaged
part
each
element
takes
its
share
in
the
reparative
process
by
producing
new
material
which
approximates
more
or
less
closely
to
the
normal
according
to
the
recuperative
capacity
of
the
particular
tissue
the
normal
process
of
repair
may
be
interfered
with
by
various
extraneous
agencies
the
most
important
of
which
are
infection
by
disease
producing
micro
organisms
the
presence
of
foreign
substances
undue
movement
of
the
affected
part
and
improper
applications
and
dressings
the
effect
of
these
agencies
is
to
delay
repair
or
to
prevent
the
individual
tissues
carrying
the
process
to
the
furthest
degree
of
which
they
are
capable
in
the
management
of
wounds
and
other
diseased
conditions
the
main
object
of
the
surgeon
is
to
promote
the
natural
reparative
process
by
preventing
or
eliminating
any
factor
by
which
it
may
be
disturbed
healing
by
primary
union
the
most
favourable
conditions
for
the
progress
of
the
reparative
process
are
to
be
found
in  clean
cut
wound
of
the
integument
which
is
uncomplicated
by
loss
of
tissue
by
the
presence
of
foreign
substances
or
by
infection
with
disease
producing
micro
organisms
and
its
edges
are
in
contact
such  wound
in
virtue
of
the
absence
of
infection
is
said
to
be
aseptic
and
under
these
conditions
healing
takes
place
by
what
is
called
primary
union
the
healing
by
first
intention
of
the
older
writers
granulation
tissue
the
essential
and
invariable
medium
of
repair
in
all
structures
is
an
elementary
form
of
new
tissue
known
as
granulation
tissue
which
is
produced
in
the
damaged
area
in
response
to
the
irritation
caused
by
injury
or
disease
the
vital
reaction
induced
by
such
irritation
results
in
dilatation
of
the
vessels
of
the
part
emigration
of
leucocytes
transudation
of
lymph
and
certain
proliferative
changes
in
the
fixed
tissue
cells
these
changes
are
common
to
the
processes
of
inflammation
and
repair
no
hard
and
fast
line
can
be
drawn
between
these
processes
and
the
two
may
go
on
together
it
is
however
only
when
the
proliferative
changes
have
come
to
predominate
that
the
reparative
process
is
effectively
established
by
the
production
of
healthy
granulation
tissue
formation
of
granulation
tissue
when  wound
is
made
in
the
integument
under
aseptic
conditions
the
passage
of
the
knife
through
the
tissues
is
immediately
followed
by
an
oozing
of
blood
which
soon
coagulates
on
the
cut
surfaces
in
each
of
the
divided
vessels  clot
forms
and
extends
as
far
as
the
nearest
collateral
branch
and
on
the
surface
of
the
wound
there
is  microscopic
layer
of
bruised
and
devitalised
tissue
if
the
wound
is
closed
the
narrow
space
between
its
edges
is
occupied
by
blood
clot
which
consists
of
red
and
white
corpuscles
mixed
with  quantity
of
fibrin
and
this
forms  temporary
uniting
medium
between
the
divided
surfaces
during
the
first
twelve
hours
the
minute
vessels
in
the
vicinity
of
the
wound
dilate
and
from
them
lymph
exudes
and
leucocytes
migrate
into
the
tissues
in
from
twenty
four
to
thirty
six
hours
the
capillaries
of
the
part
adjacent
to
the
wound
begin
to
throw
out
minute
buds
and
fine
processes
which
bridge
the
gap
and
form  firmer
but
still
temporary
connection
between
the
two
sides
each
bud
begins
in
the
wall
of
the
capillary
as  small
accumulation
of
granular
protoplasm
which
gradually
elongates
into  filament
containing  nucleus
this
filament
either
joins
with  neighbouring
capillary
or
with  similar
filament
and
in
time
these
become
hollow
and
are
filled
with
blood
from
the
vessels
that
gave
them
origin
in
this
way  series
of
young
capillary
loops
is
formed
the
spaces
between
these
loops
are
filled
by
cells
of
various
kinds
the
most
important
being
the
fibroblasts
which
are
destined
to
form
cicatricial
fibrous
tissue
these
fibroblasts
are
large
irregular
nucleated
cells
derived
mainly
from
the
proliferation
of
the
fixed
connective
tissue
cells
of
the
part
and
to  less
extent
from
the
lymphocytes
and
other
mononuclear
cells
which
have
migrated
from
the
vessels
among
the
fibroblasts
larger
multi
nucleated
cells
giant
cells
are
sometimes
found
particularly
when
resistant
substances
such
as
silk
ligatures
or
fragments
of
bone
are
embedded
in
the
tissues
and
their
function
seems
to
be
to
soften
such
substances
preliminary
to
their
being
removed
by
the
phagocytes
numerous
polymorpho
nuclear
leucocytes
which
have
wandered
from
the
vessels
are
also
present
in
the
spaces
these
act
as
phagocytes
their
function
being
to
remove
the
red
corpuscles
and
fibrin
of
the
original
clot
and
this
performed
they
either
pass
back
into
the
circulation
in
virtue
of
their
amoeboid
movement
or
are
themselves
eaten
up
by
the
growing
fibroblasts
beyond
this
phagocytic
action
they
do
not
appear
to
play
any
direct
part
in
the
reparative
process
these
young
capillary
loops
with
their
supporting
cells
and
fluids
constitute
granulation
tissue
which
is
usually
fully
formed
in
from
three
to
five
days
after
which
it
begins
to
be
replaced
by
cicatricial
or
scar
tissue
formation
of
cicatricial
tissue
the
transformation
of
this
temporary
granulation
tissue
into
scar
tissue
is
effected
by
the
fibroblasts
which
become
elongated
and
spindle
shaped
and
produce
in
and
around
them  fine
fibrillated
material
which
gradually
increases
in
quantity
till
it
replaces
the
cell
protoplasm
in
this
way
white
fibrous
tissue
is
formed
the
cells
of
which
are
arranged
in
parallel
lines
and
eventually
become
grouped
in
bundles
constituting
fully
formed
white
fibrous
tissue
in
its
growth
it
gradually
obliterates
the
capillaries
until
at
the
end
of
two
three
or
four
weeks
both
vessels
and
cells
have
almost
entirely
disappeared
and
the
original
wound
is
occupied
by
cicatricial
tissue
in
course
of
time
this
tissue
becomes
consolidated
and
the
cicatrix
undergoes  certain
amount
of
contraction
cicatricial
contraction
healing
of

while
these
changes
are
taking
place
in
the
deeper
parts
of
the
wound
the
surface
is
being
covered
over
by
epidermis
growing
in
from
the
margins
within
twelve
hours
the
cells
of
the
rete
malpighii
close
to
the
cut
edge
begin
to
sprout
on
to
the
surface
of
the
wound
and
by
their
proliferation
gradually
cover
the
granulations
with  thin
pink
pellicle
as
the
epithelium
increases
in
thickness
it
assumes  bluish
hue
and
eventually
the
cells
become
cornified
and
the

assumes  greyish

clinical
aspects
so
long
as
the
process
of
repair
is
not
complicated
by
infection
with
micro
organisms
there
is
no
interference
with
the
general
health
of

modifications
of
the
process
of

the
process
of
repair
by
primary
union
above
described
is
to
be
looked
upon
as
the
type
of
all
reparative
processes
such
modifications
as
are
met
with
depending
merely
upon
incidental
differences
in
the
conditions
present
such
as
loss
of
tissue
infection
by
micro
organisms
etc
repair
after
loss
or
destruction
of
tissue
when
the
edges
of  wound
cannot
be
approximated
either
because
tissue
has
been
lost
for
example
in
excising  tumour
or
because  drainage
tube
or
gauze
packing
has
been
necessary  greater
amount
of
granulation
tissue
is
required
to
fill
the
gap
but
the
process
is
essentially
the
same
as
in
the
ideal
method
of
repair
the
raw
surface
is
first
covered
by  layer
of
coagulated
blood
and
fibrin
an
extensive
new
formation
of
capillary
loops
and
fibroblasts
takes
place
towards
the
free
surface
and
goes
on
until
the
gap
is
filled
by  fine
velvet
like
mass
of
granulation
tissue
this
granulation
tissue
is
gradually
replaced
by
young
cicatricial
tissue
and
the
surface
is
covered
by
the
ingrowth
of
epithelium
from
the
edges
this
modification
of
the
reparative
process
can
be
best
studied
clinically
in  recent
wound
which
has
been
packed
with
gauze
when
the
plug
is
introduced
the
walls
of
the
cavity
consist
of
raw
tissue
with
numerous
oozing
blood
vessels
on
removing
the
packing
on
the
fifth
or
sixth
day
the
surface
is
found
to
be
covered
with
minute
red
papillary
granulations
which
are
beginning
to
fill
up
the
cavity
at
the
edges
the
epithelium
has
proliferated
and
is
covering
over
the
newly
formed
granulation
tissue
as
lymph
and
leucocytes
escape
from
the
exposed
surface
there
is  certain
amount
of
serous
or
sero
purulent
discharge
on
examining
the
wound
at
intervals
of  few
days
it
is
found
that
the
granulation
tissue
gradually
increases
in
amount
till
the
gap
is
completely
filled
up
and
that
coincidently
the
epithelium
spreads
in
and
covers
over
its
surface
in
course
of
time
the
epithelium
thickens
and
as
the
granulation
tissue
is
slowly
replaced
by
young
cicatricial
tissue
which
has  peculiar
tendency
to
contract
and
so
to
obliterate
the
blood
vessels
in
it
the
scar
that
is
left
becomes
smooth
pale
and
depressed
this
method
of
healing
is
sometimes
spoken
of
as
healing
by
granulation
although
as
we
have
seen
it
is
by
granulation
that
all
repair
takes
place
healing
by
union
of
two
granulating
surfaces
in
gaping
wounds
union
is
sometimes
obtained
by
bringing
the
two
surfaces
into
apposition
after
each
has
become
covered
with
healthy
granulations
the
exudate
on
the
surfaces
causes
them
to
adhere
capillary
loops
pass
from
one
to
the
other
and
their
final
fusion
takes
place
by
the
further
development
of
granulation
and
cicatricial
tissue
reunion
of
parts
entirely
separated
from
the
body
small
portions
of
tissue
such
as
the
end
of  finger
the
tip
of
the
nose
or  portion
of
the
external
ear
accidentally
separated
from
the
body
if
accurately
replaced
and
fixed
in
position
occasionally
adhere
by
primary
union
in
the
course
of
operations
also
portions
of
skin
fascia
or
bone
or
even  complete

may
be
transplanted
and
unite
by
primary
union
healing
under  scab
when  small
superficial
wound
is
exposed
to
the
air
the
blood
and
serum
exuded
on
its
surface
may
dry
and
form  hard
crust
or
scab
which
serves
to
protect
the
surface
from
external
irritation
in
the
same
way
as
would  dry
pad
of
sterilised
gauze
under
this
scab
the
formation
of
granulation
tissue
its
transformation
into
cicatricial
tissue
and
the
growth
of
epithelium
on
the
surface
go
on
until
in
the
course
of
time
the
crust
separates
leaving  scar
healing
by
blood
clot
in
subcutaneous
wounds
for
example
tenotomy
in
amputation
wounds
and
in
wounds
made
in
excising
tumours
or
in
operating
upon
bones
the
space
left
between
the
divided
tissues
becomes
filled
with
blood
clot
which
acts
as  temporary
scaffolding
in
which
granulation
tissue
is
built
up
capillary
loops
grow
into
the
coagulum
and
migrated
leucocytes
from
the
adjacent
blood
vessels
destroy
the
red
corpuscles
and
are
in
turn
disposed
of
by
the
developing
fibroblasts
which
by
their
growth
and
proliferation
fill
up
the
gap
with
young
connective
tissue
it
will
be
evident
that
this
process
only
differs
from
healing
by
primary
union
in
the
amount
of
blood
clot
that
is
present
presence
of  foreign
body
when
an
aseptic
foreign
body
is
present
in

e a
piece
of
unabsorbable
chromicised
catgut
the
healing
process
may
be
modified
after
primary
union
has
taken
place
the
scar
may
broaden
become
raised
above
the
surface
and
assume  bluish
brown
colour
the
epidermis
gradually
thins
and
gives
way
revealing
the
softened
portion
of
catgut
which
can
be
pulled
out
in
pieces
after
which
the
wound
rapidly
heals
and
resumes  normal
appearance
repair
in
individual
tissues
skin
and
connective
tissue
the
mode
of
regeneration
of
these
tissues
under
aseptic
conditions
has
already
been
described
as
the
type
of
ideal
repair
in
highly
vascular
parts
such
as
the
face
the
reparative
process
goes
on
with
great
rapidity
and
even
extensive
wounds
may
be
firmly
united
in
from
three
to
five
days
where
the
anastomosis
is
less
free
the
process
is
more
prolonged
the
more
highly
organised
elements
of
the
skin
such
as
the
hair
follicles
the
sweat
and
sebaceous
glands
are
imperfectly
reproduced
hence
the
scar
remains
smooth
dry
and
hairless
epithelium
epithelium
is
only
reproduced
from
pre
existing
epithelium
and
as  rule
from
one
of  similar
type
although
metaplastic
transformation
of
cells
of
one
kind
of
epithelium
into
another
kind
can
take
place
thus  granulating
surface
may
be
covered
entirely
by
the
ingrowing
of
the
cutaneous
epithelium
from
the
margins
or
islets
originating
in
surviving
cells
of
sebaceous
glands
or
sweat
glands
or
of
hair
follicles
may
spring
up
in
the
centre
of
the
raw
area
such
islets
may
also
be
due
to
the
accidental
transference
of
loose
epithelial
cells
from
the
edges
even
the
fluid
from  blister
in
virtue
of
the
isolated
cells
of
the
rete
malpighii
which
it
contains
is
capable
of
starting
epithelial
growth
on  granulating

hairs
and
nails
may
be
completely
regenerated
if  sufficient
amount
of
the
hair
follicles
or
of
the
nail
matrix
has
escaped
destruction
the
epithelium
of  mucous
membrane
is
regenerated
in
the
same
way
as
that
on  cutaneous
surface
epithelial
cells
have
the
power
of
living
for
some
time
after
being
separated
from
their
normal
surroundings
and
of
growing
again
when
once
more
placed
in
favourable
circumstances
on
this
fact
the
practice
of
skin
grafting
is
based  cartilage
when
an
articular
cartilage
is
divided
by
incision
or
by
being
implicated
in  fracture
involving
the
articular
end
of  bone
it
is
repaired
by
ordinary
cicatricial
fibrous
tissue
derived
from
the
proliferating
cells
of
the
perichondrium
cartilage
being  non
vascular
tissue
the
reparative
process
goes
on
slowly
and
it
may
be
many
weeks
before
it
is
complete
it
is
possible
for  metaplastic
transformation
of
connective
tissue
cells
into
cartilage
cells
to
take
place
the
characteristic
hyaline
matrix
being
secreted
by
the
new
cells
this
is
sometimes
observed
as
an
intermediary
stage
in
the
healing
of
fractures
especially
in
young
bones
it
may
also
take
place
in
the
regeneration
of
lost
portions
of
cartilage
provided
the
new
tissue
is
so
situated
as
to
constitute
part
of  joint
and
to
be
subjected
to
pressure
by
an
opposing
cartilaginous
surface
this
is
illustrated
by
what
takes
place
after
excision
of
joints
where
it
is
desired
to
restore
the
function
of
the
articulation
by
carrying
out
movements
between
the
constituent
parts
the
fibrous
tissue
covering
the
ends
of
the
bones
becomes
moulded
into
shape
its
cells
take
on
the
characters
of
cartilage
cells
and
forming  matrix
so
develop  new
cartilage
conversely
it
is
observed
that
when
articular
cartilage
is
no
longer
subjected
to
pressure
by
an
opposing
cartilage
it
tends
to
be
transformed
into
fibrous
tissue
as
may
be
seen
in
deformities
attended
with
displacement
of
articular
surfaces
such
as
hallux
valgus
and
club
foot
after
fractures
of
costal
cartilage
or
of
the
cartilages
of
the
larynx
the
cicatricial
tissue
may
be
ultimately
replaced
by
bone
tendons
when  tendon
is
divided
for
example
by
subcutaneous
tenotomy
the
end
nearer
the
muscle
fibres
is
drawn
away
from
the
other
leaving  gap
which
is
speedily
filled
by
blood
clot
in
the
course
of  few
days
this
clot
becomes
permeated
by
granulation
tissue
the
fibroblasts
of
which
are
derived
from
the
sheath
of
the
tendon
the
surrounding
connective
tissue
and
probably
also
from
the
divided
ends
of
the
tendon
itself
these
fibroblasts
ultimately
develop
into
typical
tendon
cells
and
the
fibres
which
they
form
constitute
the
new
tendon
fibres
under
aseptic
conditions
repair
is
complete
in
from
two
to
three
weeks
in
the
course
of
the
reparative
process
the
tendon
and
its
sheath
may
become
adherent
which
leads
to
impaired
movement
and
stiffness
if
the
ends
of
an
accidentally
divided
tendon
are
at
once
brought
into
accurate
apposition
and
secured
by
sutures
they
unite
directly
with  minimum

of

not
seem

are
at
once
brought
into

by

takes

with  minimum
of
intervening
fibrous

the
nuclei
of
the
muscle
fibres
in
close
proximity
to
this
young
cicatricial
tissue
proliferate
and  few
new
muscle
fibres
may
be
developed
but
any
gross
loss
of
muscular
tissue
is
replaced
by  fibrous
cicatrix
it
would
appear
that
portions
of
muscle
transplanted
from
animals
to
fill
up
gaps
in
human
muscle
are
similarly
replaced
by
fibrous
tissue
when  muscle
is
paralysed
from
loss
of
its
nerve
supply
and
undergoes
complete
degeneration
it
is
not
capable
of
being
regenerated
even
should
the
integrity
of
the

be
restored
and
so
its

is
permanently
lost

the
regeneration
of

incomplete

taking
the
place
of
the

been
destroyed
in

of
the

for
example
the

is
filled
by
fibrous
tissue
but
towards
the
periphery
of
the

the
liver
cells
proliferate
and  certain
amount
of
regeneration
takes
place
in
the
kidney
also
repair
mainly
takes
place
by
cicatricial
tissue
and
although  few
collecting
tubules
may
be
reformed
no
regeneration
of
secreting
tissue
takes
place
after
the
operation
of
decapsulation
of
the
kidney  new
capsule
is
formed
and
during
the
process
young
blood
vessels
permeate
the
superficial
parts
of
the
kidney
and
temporarily
increase
its
blood
supply
but
in
the
consolidation
of
the
new
fibrous
tissue
these
vessels
are
ultimately
obliterated
this
does
not
prove
that
the
operation
is
useless
as
the
temporary
improvement
of
the

serve
to

while
the

at
which

heal
is
remarkably
constant
there
are
certain
factors
that
influence
it

direction
or
the
other
healing
is
more
rapid
when
the

are
in

when
there
is  minimum

between

when
the

is
in

and
the
vitality
of
the

has
not
been
impaired
wounds
heal
slightly
more
quickly
in
the
young
than
in
the
old
although
the
difference
is
so
small
that
it
can
only
be
demonstrated
by
the
most
careful
observations
certain
tissues
take
longer
to
heal
than
others
for
example  fracture
of
one
of
the
larger
long
bones
takes
about
six
weeks
to
unite
and
divided
nerve
trunks
take
much
longer
about  year
wounds
of
certain
parts
of
the
body
heal
more
quickly
than
others
those
of
the
scalp
face
and
neck
for
example
heal
more
quickly
than
those
over
the
buttock
or
sacrum
probably
because
of
their
greater
vascularity
the
extent
of
the
wound
influences
the
rate
of
healing
it
is
only
natural
that  long
and
deep
wound
should
take
longer
to
heal
than  short
and
superficial
one
because
there
is
so
much
more
work
to
be
done
in
the
conversion
of
blood
clot
into
granulation
tissue
and
this
again
into
scar
tissue
that
will
be
strong
enough
to
stand
the
strain
on
the
edges
of
the
wound
the
transplantation
or
grafting
of
tissues
conditions
are
not
infrequently
met
with
in
which
healing
is
promoted
and
restoration
of
function
made
possible
by
the
transference
of  portion
of
tissue
from
one
part
of
the
body
to
another
the
tissue
transferred
is
known
as
the
graft
or
the
transplant
the
simplest
example
of
grafting
is
the
transplantation
of
skin
in
order
that
the
graft
may
survive
and
have  favourable
chance
of
taking
as
it
is
called
the
transplanted
tissue
must
retain
its
vitality
until
it
has
formed
an
organic
connection
with
the
tissue
in
which
it
is
placed
so
that
it
may
derive
the
necessary
nourishment
from
its
new
bed
when
these
conditions
are
fulfilled
the
tissues
of
the
graft
continue
to
proliferate
producing
new
tissue
elements
to
replace
those
that
are
lost
and
making
it
possible
for
the
graft
to
become
incorporated
with
the
tissue
with
which
it
is
in
contact
dead
tissue
on
the
other
hand
can
do
neither
of
these
things
it
is
only
capable
of
acting
as  model
or
at
the
most
as  scaffolding
for
such
mobile
tissue
elements
as
may
be
derived
from
the
parent
tissue
with
which
the
graft
is
in
contact  portion
of
sterilised
marine
sponge
for
example
may
be
observed
to
become
permeated
with
granulation
tissue
when
it
is
embedded
in
the
tissues  successful
graft
of
living
tissue
is
not
only
capable
of
regeneration
but
it
acquires  system
of
lymph
and
blood
vessels
so
that
in
time
it
bleeds
when
cut
into
and
is
permeated
by
new
nerve
fibres
spreading
in
from
the
periphery
towards
the
centre
it
is
instructive
to
associate
the
period
of
survival
of
the
different
tissues
of
the
body
after
death
with
their
capacity
of
being
used
for
grafting
purposes
the
higher
tissues
such
as
those
of
the
central
nervous
system
and
highly
specialised
glandular
tissues
like
those
of
the
kidney
lose
their
vitality
quickly
after
death
and
are
therefore
useless
for
grafting
connective
tissues
on
the
other
hand
such
as
fat
cartilage
and
bone
retain
their
vitality
for
several
hours
after
death
so
that
when
they
are
transplanted
they
readily
take
and
do
all
that
is
required
of
them
the
same
is
true
of
the
skin
and
its
appendages
sources
of
grafts
it
is
convenient
to
differentiate
between
autoplastic
grafts
that
is
those
derived
from
the
same
individual
homoplastic
grafts
derived
from
another
animal
of
the
same
species
and
heteroplastic
grafts
derived
from
an
animal
of
another
species
other
conditions
being
equal
the
prospects
of
success
are
greatest
with
autoplastic
grafts
and
these
are
therefore
preferred
whenever
possible
there
are
certain
details
making
for
success
that
merit
attention
the
graft
must
not
be
roughly
handled
or
allowed
to
dry
or
be
subjected
to
chemical
irritation
it
must
be
brought
into
accurate
contact
with
the
new
soil
no
blood
clot
intervening
between
the
two
no
movement
of
the
one
upon
the
other
should
be
possible
and
all
infection
must
be
excluded
it
will
be
observed
that
these
are
exactly
the
same
conditions
that
permit
of
the
primary
healing
of
wounds
with
which
of
course
the
healing
of
grafts
is
exactly
comparable
preservation
of
tissues
for
grafting
it
was
at
one
time
believed
that
tissues
might
be
taken
from
the
operating
theatre
and
kept
in
cold
storage
until
they
were
required
it
is
now
agreed
that
tissues
which
have
been
separated
from
the
body
for
some
time
inevitably
lose
their
vitality
become
incapable
of
regeneration
and
are
therefore
unsuited
for
grafting
purposes
if
it
is
intended
to
preserve  portion
of
tissue
for
future
grafting
it
should
be
embedded
in
the
subcutaneous
tissue
of
the
abdominal
wall
until
it
is
wanted

methods
of
skin
grafting
two
methods
are
employed
one
in
which
the
epidermis
is
mainly
or
exclusively
employed
epidermis
or
epithelial
grafting
the
other
in
which
the
graft
consists
of
the
whole
thickness
of
the
true
skin
cutis
grafting
epidermis
or
epithelial
grafting
the
method
introduced
by
the
late
professor
thiersch
of
leipsic
is
that
almost
universally
practised
it
consists
in
transplanting
strips
of
epidermis
shaved
from
the
surface
of
the
skin
the
razor
passing
through
the
tips
of
the
papillae
which
appear
as
tiny
red
points
yielding  moderate
ooze
of
blood
the
strips
are
obtained
from
the
front
and
lateral
aspects
of
the
thigh
or
upper
arm
the
skin
in
those
regions
being
pliable
and
comparatively
free
from
hairs
they
are
cut
with  sharp
hollow
ground
razor
or
with
thiersch  grafting
knife
the
blade
of
which
is
rinsed
in
alcohol
and
kept
moistened
with
warm
saline
solution
the
cutting
is
made
easier
if
the
skin
is
well
stretched
and
kept
flat
and
perfectly
steady

to
ensure
uniform
strips
being
cut
the
razor
is
kept
parallel
with
the
surface
and
used
with  short
rapid
sawing
movement
so
that
with  little
practice
grafts
six
or
eight
inches
long
by
one
or
two
inches
broad
can
readily
be
cut
the

is
obtained
by
injections
of  solution
of

novocain
into
the
line
of

middle
cutaneous
nerves
the
disinfection
of
the
skin
is
carried
out
on
the
usual
lines
any
chemical
agent
being
finally
got
rid
of
however
by
means
of
alcohol
followed
by

solution
the
strips
of

wrinkle
up
on

which
they
should
be
made
to
form  complete

of
the
area

another
some
blunt
instrument
is
used
to

to
ensure
accurate

and
of
that
also
from
which
the
grafts
have
been
taken
gauze
soaked
in
liquid
paraffin
the
patent
variety
known
as
ambrine
is
excellent
appears
to
be
the
best
the
gauze
should
be
moistened
every
other
day
or
so
with
fresh
paraffin
so
that
at
the
end
of  week
when
the
grafts
should
have
united
the
gauze
can
be
removed
without
risk
of
detaching
them
dental
wax
is
another
useful
type
of
dressing
as
is
also
picric
acid
solution
over
the
gauze
there
is
applied  thick
layer
of
cotton
wool
and
the
whole
dressing
is
kept
in
place
by  firmly
applied
bandage
and
in
the
case
of
the
limbs
some
form
of
splint
should
be
added
to
prevent
movement  dressing
may
be
dispensed
with
altogether
the
grafts
being
protected
by  wire
cage
such
as
is
used
after
vaccination
but
they
tend
to
dry
up
and
come
to
resemble  scab
when
the
grafts
have
healed
it
is
well
to
protect
them
from
injury
and
to
prevent
them
drying
up
and
cracking
by
the
liberal
application
of
lanoline
or
vaseline
the
new
skin
is
at
first
insensitive
and
is
fixed
to
the
underlying
connective
tissue
or
bone
but
in
course
of
time
from
six
weeks
onwards
sensation
returns
and
the
formation
of
elastic
tissue
beneath
renders
the
skin
pliant
and
movable
so
that
it
can
be
pinched
up
between

sometimes
an
advantage

the
dressing

the
after

are
the

as
in

there
is  degree
of
uncertainty
about
the

retaining
its

long
enough
to
permit
of
its
deriving
the

be  complete
absence

there
must
be
no

owing
to
the
uncertainty
in
the
results
of
cutis

the
two
stage
or
indirect
method
has
been
introduced
and
its
almost
uniform
success
has
led
to
its
sphere
of
application
being
widely
extended
the
flap
is
raised
as
in
the
direct
method
but
is
left
attached
at
one
of
its
margins
for  period
ranging
from
to
days
until
its
blood
supply
from
its
new
bed
is
assured
the
detachment
is
then
made
complete
the
blood
supply
of
the
proposed
flap
may
influence
its
selection
and
the
way
in
which
it
is
fashioned
for
example  flap
cut
from
the
side
of
the
head
to
fill  defect
in
the
cheek
having
in
its
margin
of
attachment
or
pedicle
the
superficial
temporal
artery
is
more
likely
to
take
than  flap
cut
with
its
base
above
another
modification
is
to
raise
the
flap
but
leave
it
connected
at
both
ends
like
the
piers
of  bridge
this
method
is
well
suited
to
defects
of
skin
on
the
dorsum
of
the
fingers
hand
and
forearm
the
bridge
of
skin
is
raised
from
the
abdominal
wall
and
the
hand
is
passed
beneath
it
and
securely
fixed
in
position
after
an
interval
of
to
days
when
the
flap
is
assured
of
its
blood
supply
the
piers
of
the

are
divided

is
usually
easy
to
bring
the
edges
of
the
gap
in
the
abdominal
wall
together
even
in
children
the
skin
flap
on
the
dorsum
of
the
hand
appears
rather
thick
and
prominent
almost
like
the
pad
of  boxing
glove
for
some
time
but
the
restoration
of
function
in
the
capacity
to
flex
the
fingers
is
gratifying

the
extreme
illustration

divided
after

adhered
the
indirect
element
of
this
method
of
skin
grafting
may
be
carried
still
further
by
transferring
the
flap

then
after

of
these
one
of
the
most
important
is
undue
movement
of
the
affected
part
the
first
and
great
requisite
for
the
restoration
of
injured
parts
is
rest
said
john
hunter
and
physiological
and
mechanical
rest
as
the
chief
of
natural
therapeutic
agents
was
the
theme
of
john
hilton  classical
work
rest
and
pain
in
this
connection
it
must
be
understood
that
rest
implies
more
than
the
mere
state
of
physical
repose
all
physiological
as
well
as
mechanical
function
must
be
prevented
as
far
as
is
possible
for
instance
the
constituent
bones
of  joint
affected
with
tuberculosis
must
be
controlled
by
splints
or
other
appliances
so
that
no
movement
can
take
place
between
them
and
the
limb
may
not
be
used
for
any
purpose
physiological
rest
may
be
secured
to
an
inflamed
colon
by
making
an
artificial
anus
in
the

the
activity
of  diseased
kidney
may
be
diminished
by
regulating
the
quantity
and
quality
of
the
fluids
taken
by
the
patient
another
source
of
interference
with
repair
in
wounds
is
irritation
either
by
mechanical
agents
such
as
rough
unsuitable
dressings
bandages
or
ill
fitting
splints
or
by
chemical
agents
in
the
form
of
strong
lotions
or
other
applications
an
unhealthy
or
devitalised
condition
of
the
patient  tissues
also
hinders
the
reparative
process
bruised
or
lacerated
skin
heals
less
kindly
than
skin
cut
with  smooth
sharp
instrument
and
persistent
venous
congestion
of  part
such
as
occurs
for
example
in
the
leg
when
the
veins
are
varicose
by
preventing
the
access
of
healthy
blood
tends
to
delay
the
healing
of
open
wounds
the
existence
of
grave
constitutional
disease
such
as
bright  disease
diabetes
syphilis
scurvy
or
alcoholism
also
impedes
healing
infection
by
disease
producing
micro
organisms
or
pathogenic
bacteria
is
however
the
most
potent
factor
in
disturbing
the
natural
process
of
repair
in
wounds
surgical
bacteriology
the
influence
of
micro
organisms
in
the
causation
of
disease
and
the
role
played
by
them
in
interfering
with
the
natural
process
of
repair
are
so
important
that
the
science
of
applied
bacteriology
has
now
come
to
dominate
every
department
of
surgery
and
it
is
from
the
standpoint
of
bacteriology
that
nearly
all
surgical
questions
have
to
be
considered
the
term
sepsis
as
now
used
in
clinical
surgery
no
longer
retains
its
original
meaning
as
synonymous
with
putrefaction
but
is
employed
to
denote
all
conditions
in
which
bacterial
infection
has
taken
place
and
more
particularly
those
in
which
pyogenic
bacteria
are
present
in
the
same
way
the
term
aseptic
conveys
the
idea
of
freedom
from
all
forms
of
bacteria
putrefactive
or
otherwise
and
the
term
antiseptic
is
used
to
denote  power
of
counteracting
bacteria
and
their
products
general

remarkable
for
their
tenacity
of
life

for
the
resistance
they
offer
to

those
that
resemble  rod
bacilli
the
spiral

cocci
or
micrococci
are
minute
round

motile
they
multiply
by
fission
and
when
they
divide
in
such  way
that
the
resulting
cells
remain
in
pairs
are
called
diplococci
of
which
the
bacteria
of
gonorrhoea
and
pneumonia
are
examples
fig
when
they
divide
irregularly

are
known
as
staphylococci

pathogenic
properties
of
bacteria
we
are
now
only
concerned
with
pathogenic
bacteria
that
is
bacteria
capable
of
producing
disease
in
the
human
subject
this
capacity
depends
upon
two
sets
of
factors
certain
features
peculiar
to
the
invading
bacteria
and
others
peculiar
to
the
host
many
bacteria
have
only
the
power
of
living
upon
dead
matter
and
are
known
as
saphrophytes
such
as
do
nourish
in
living
tissue
are
by
distinction
known
as
parasites
the
power  given
parasitic
micro
organism
has
of
multiplying
in
the
body
and
giving
rise
to
disease
is
spoken
of
as
its
virulence
and
this
varies
not
only
with
different
species
but
in
the
same
species
at
different
times
and
under
varying
circumstances
the
actual
number
of
organisms
introduced
is
also
an
important
factor
in
determining
their
pathogenic
power
healthy
tissues
can
resist
the
invasion
of  certain
number
of
bacteria
of  given
species
but
when
that
number
is
exceeded
the
organisms
get
the
upper
hand
and
disease
results
when
the
organisms
gain
access
directly
to
the
blood
stream
as  rule
they
produce
their
effects
more
certainly
and
with
greater
intensity
than
when
they
are
introduced
into
the
tissues
further
the
virulence
of
an
organism
is
modified
by
the
condition
of
the
patient
into
whose
tissues
it
is
introduced
so
long
as  person
is
in
good
health
the
tissues
are
able
to
resist
the
attacks
of
moderate
numbers
of
most
bacteria
any
lowering
of
the
vitality
of
the
individual
however
either
locally
or
generally
at
once
renders
him
more
susceptible
to
infection
thus
bruised
or
torn
tissue
is
much
more
liable
to
infection
with
pus
producing
organisms
than
tissues
clean
cut
with  knife
also
after
certain
diseases
the
liability
to
infection
by
the
organisms
of
diphtheria
pneumonia
or
erysipelas
is
much
increased
even
such
slight
depression
of
vitality
as
results
from
bodily
fatigue
or
exposure
to
cold
and
damp
may
be
sufficient
to
turn
the
scale
in
the
battle
between
the
tissues
and
the
bacteria
age
is
an
important
factor
in
regard
to
the
action
of
certain
bacteria
young
subjects
are
attacked
by
diphtheria
tuberculosis
acute
osteomyelitis
and
some
other
diseases
with
greater
frequency
and
severity
than
those
of
more
advanced
years
in
different
races
localities
environment
and
seasons
the
pathogenic
powers
of
certain
organisms
such
as
those
of
erysipelas
diphtheria
and
acute
osteomyelitis
vary
considerably
there
is
evidence
that  mixed
infection
that
is
the
introduction
of
more
than
one
species
of
organism
for
example
the
tubercle
bacillus
and  pyogenic
staphylococcus
increases
the
severity
of
the
resulting
disease
if
one
of
the
varieties
gain
the
ascendancy
the
poisons
produced
by
the
others
so
devitalise
the
tissue
cells
and
diminish
their
power
of
resistance
that
the
virulence
of
the
most
active
organisms
is
increased
on
the
other
hand
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
the
products
of
certain
organisms
antagonise
one
another
for
example
an
attack
of
erysipelas
may
effect
the
cure
of  patch
of
tuberculous
lupus
lastly
in
patients
suffering
from
chronic
wasting
diseases
bacteria
may
invade
the
internal
organs
by
the
blood
stream
in
enormous
numbers
and
with
great
rapidity
during
the
period
of
extreme
debility
which
shortly
precedes
death
the
discovery
of
such
collections
of
organisms
on
post
mortem
examination
may
lead
to
erroneous
conclusions
being
drawn
as
to
the
cause
of
death
results
of
bacterial
growth
some
organisms
such
as
those
of
tetanus
and
erysipelas
and
certain
of
the
pyogenic
bacteria
show
little
tendency
to
pass
far
beyond
the
point
at
which
they
gain
an
entrance
to
the
body
others
on
the
contrary
for
example
the
tubercle
bacillus
and
the
organism
of
acute
osteomyelitis
although
frequently
remaining
localised
at
the
seat
of
inoculation
tend
to
pass
to
distant
parts
lodging
in
the
capillaries
of
joints

or

there
producing
their
deleterious

when

of

under

it
would

that

tends
to
interfere
with
the
continued
life
and
growth
of
the
organisms
themselves
and
in
this
way
the
natural
cure
of
certain
diseases
is
brought
about
outside

bacteria
may
be
killed
by

phagocytosis
in

the

they

to
this

metchnikoff
gave
the
name
of
phagocytosis
and
he
recognised
two
forms
of
phagocytes
the
microphages
which
are
the
polymorpho
nuclear
leucocytes
of
the

and
the
macrophages
which
include
the

hyaline
leucocytes

corpuscles
during
the
process
of

the
polymorpho

leucocytes
in

increase
greatly
in
numbers
leucocytosis
as
well
as
in
their
phagocytic
action
and
in
the
course
of
destroying
the
bacteria
they
produce
certain
ferments
which
enter
the
blood
serum
these
are
known
as
opsonins
or
alexins
and
they
act
on
the
bacteria
by  process
comparable
to
narcotisation
and
render
them
an
easy
prey
for
the
phagocytes
artificial

can
be
induced
by
the
introduction
of
protective
substances
obtained
from
an
animal
which
has
been

immunised
the
process
by
which
passive
immunity
is
acquired
depends
upon
the
fact
that
as  result

the

between
the

the

give
rise
leucocytosis
most
bacterial
diseases
as
well
as
certain
other
pathological
conditions
are
associated
with
an
increase
in
the
number
of
leucocytes
in
the
blood
throughout
the
circulatory
system
this
condition
of
the
blood
which
is
known
as
leucocytosis
is
believed
to
be
due
to
an
excessive
output
and
rapid
formation
of
leucocytes
by
the
bone
marrow
and
it
probably
has
as
its
object
the
arrest
and
destruction
of
the
invading
organisms
or
toxins
to
increase
the
resisting
power
of
the
system
to
pathogenic
organisms
an
artificial
leucocytosis
may
be
induced
by
subcutaneous
injection
of  solution
of
nucleinate
of
soda
minims

the

in

under

conditions

when
leucocytosis
is

the
number
may
range
from
to
or
even
higher
is
looked
upon
as  high
degree
of
leucocytosis
according
to
ehrlich
the
following
may
be
taken
as
the
standard

the
clinical
importance
of  leucocytosis
it
is
not
sufficient
merely
to
count
the
aggregate
number
of
leucocytes
present  differential
count
must
be
made
to
determine
which
variety
of
cells
is
in
excess
in
the
majority
of
surgical
affections
it
is
chiefly
the
granular
polymorpho
nuclear
neutrophile
leucocytes
that
are
in
excess
ordinary
leucocytosis
in
some
cases
and
particularly
in
parasitic
diseases
such
as
trichiniasis
and
hydatid
disease
the
eosinophile
leucocytes
also
show  proportionate
increase
eosinophilia
the
term
lymphocytosis
is
applied
when
there
is
an
increase
in
the
number
of
circulating
lymphocytes
as
occurs
for
example
in
lymphatic
leucaemia
and
in
certain
cases
of
syphilis
leucocytosis
is
met
with
in
nearly
all
acute
infective
diseases
and
in
acute
pyogenic
inflammatory
affections
particularly
in
those
attended
with
suppuration
in
exceptionally
acute
septic
conditions
the
extreme
virulence
of
the
toxins
may
prevent
the
leucocytes
reacting
and
leucocytosis
may
be
absent
the
absence
of
leucocytosis
in  disease
in
which
it
is
usually
present
is
therefore
to
be
looked
upon
as  grave
omen
particularly
when
the
general
symptoms
are
severe
in
some
cases
of
malignant
disease
the
number
of
leucocytes
is
increased
to
or  few
hours
after  severe
haemorrhage
also
there
is
usually  leucocytosis
of
from
to
which
lasts
for
three
or
four
days
lyon
in
cases
of
haemorrhage
the
leucocytosis
is
increased
by
infusion
of
fluids
into
the
circulation
after
all
operations
there
is
at
least  transient
leucocytosis
post
operative
leucocytosis  i
dawson
the
leucocytosis
begins
soon
after
the
infection
manifests
itself
for
example
by
shivering
rigor
or
rise
of
temperature
the
number
of
leucocytes
rises
somewhat
rapidly
increases
while
the
condition
is
progressing
and
remains
high
during
the
febrile
period
but
there
is
no
constant
correspondence
between
the
number
of
leucocytes
and
the
height
of
the
temperature
the
arrest
of
the
inflammation
and
its
resolution
are
accompanied
by  fall
in
the
number
of
leucocytes
while
the
occurrence
of
suppuration
is
attended
with  further
increase
in
their
number
in
interpreting
the
blood
count
it
is
to
be
kept
in
mind
that  physiological
leucocytosis
occurs
within
three
or
four
hours
of
taking  meal
especially
one
rich
in
proteins
from
to
being
added
to
the
normal
number
in
this
digestion
leucocytosis
the
increase
is
chiefly
in
the
polynuclear
neutrophile
leucocytes
immediately
before
and
after
delivery
particularly
in
primiparae
there
is
usually  moderate
degree
of
leucocytosis
if
the
labour
is
normal
and
the
puerperium
uncomplicated
the
number
of
leucocytes
regains
the
normal
in
about  week
lactation
has
no
appreciable
effect
on
the
number
of
leucocytes
in
new
born
infants
the
leucocyte
count
is
abnormally
high
ranging
from
to
in
children
under
one
year
of
age
the
normal
average
is
from
to
absence
of
leucocytosis
leucopenia
in
certain
infective
diseases
the
number
of
leucocytes
in
the
circulating
blood
is
abnormally
low
or
and
this
condition
is
known
as
leucopenia
it
occurs
in
typhoid
fever
especially
in
the
later
stages
of
the
disease
in
tuberculous
lesions
unaccompanied
by
suppuration
in
malaria
and
in
most
cases
of
uncomplicated
influenza
the
occurrence
of
leucocytosis
in
any
of
these
conditions
is
to
be
looked
upon
as
an
indication
that  mixed
infection
has
taken
place
and
that
some
suppurative
process
is
present
the
absence
of
leucocytosis
in
some
cases
of
virulent
septic
poisoning
has
already
been
referred
to
it
will
be
evident
that
too
much
reliance
must
not
be
placed
upon  single
observation
particularly
in
emergency
cases
whenever
possible  series
of
observations
should
be
made

being
examined
about
four
hours
after

and
about

the
clinical
significance
of
the
blood
count
in
individual
diseases
will
be
further
referred
to
the

reaction
the

count
may
be
supplemented
by
staining
films
of
the
blood
with  watery
solution
of
iodine
and
potassium
iodide
in
all
advancing
purulent
conditions
in
septic
poisonings
in

and
in
cancerous
growths
associated
with
ulceration  certain
number
of
the
polynuclear
leucocytes
are
stained  brown
or
reddish
brown
colour
due
to
the
action
of
the

clinical

general

chronic
inflammation
inflammation
may
be
defined
as
the
series
of
vital
changes
that
occurs
in
the
tissues
in
response
to
irritation
these
changes
represent
the
reaction
of
the
tissue
elements
to
the
irritant
and
constitute
the
attempt
made
by
nature
to
arrest
or
to
limit
its
injurious
effects
and
to
repair
the
damage
done
by
it
the
phenomena
which
characterise
the
inflammatory
reaction
can
be
induced
by
any
form
of
irritation
such
for
example
as
mechanical
injury
the
application
of
heat
or
of
chemical
substances
or
the
action
of
pathogenic
bacteria
and
their
toxins
and
they
are
essentially
similar
in
kind
whatever
the
irritant
may
be
the
extent
to
which
the
process
may
go
however
and
its
effects
on
the
part
implicated
and
on
the
system
as  whole
vary
with
different
irritants
and
with
the
intensity
and
duration
of
their
action  mechanical  thermal
or  chemical
irritant
acting
alone
induces  degree
of
reaction
directly
proportionate
to
its
physical
properties
and
so
long
as
it
does
not
completely
destroy
the
vitality
of
the
part
involved
the
changes
in
the
tissues
are
chiefly
directed
towards
repairing
the
damage
done
to
the
part
and
the
inflammatory
reaction
is
not
only
compatible
with
the
occurrence
of
ideal
repair
but
may
be
looked
upon
as
an
integral
step
in
the
reparative
process
the
irritation
caused
by
infection
with
bacteria
on
the
other
hand
is
cumulative
as
the
organisms
not
only
multiply
in
the
tissues
but
in
addition
produce
chemical
poisons
toxins
which
aggravate
the
irritative
effects
the
resulting
reaction
is
correspondingly
progressive
and
has
as
its
primary
object
the
expulsion
of
the
irritant
and
the
limitation
of
its
action
if
the
natural
protective
effort
is
successful
the
resulting
tissue
changes
subserve
the
process
of
repair
but
if
the
bacteria
gain
the
upper
hand
in
the
struggle
the
inflammatory
reaction
becomes
more
intense
certain
of
the
tissue
elements
succumb
and
the
process
for
the
time
being
is  destructive
one
during
the
stage
of
bacterial
inflammation
reparative
processes
are
in
abeyance
and
it
is
only
after
the
inflammation
has
been
allayed
either
by
natural
means
or
by
the
aid
of
the
surgeon
that
repair
takes
place
in
applying
the
antiseptic
principle
to
the
treatment
of
wounds
our
main
object
is
to
exclude
or
to
eliminate
the
bacterial
factor
and
so
to
prevent
the
inflammatory
reaction
going
beyond
the
stage
in
which
it
is
protective
and
just
in
proportion
as
we
succeed
in
attaining
this
object
do
we
favour
the
occurrence
of
ideal
repair
sequence
of
changes
in
bacterial
inflammation
as
the
form
of
inflammation
with
which
we
are
most
concerned
is
that
due
to
the
action
of
bacteria
in
describing
the
process
by
which
the
protective
influence
of
the
inflammatory
reaction
is
brought
into
play
we
shall
assume
the
presence
of  bacterial
irritant
the
introduction
of  colony
of
micro
organisms
is
quickly
followed
by
an
accumulation
of
wandering
cells
and
proliferation
of
connective
tissue
cells
in
the
tissues
at
the
site
of
infection
the
various
cells
are
attracted
to
the
bacteria
by  peculiar
chemical
or
biological
power
known
as
chemotaxis
which
seems
to
result
from
variations
in
the
surface
tension
of
different
varieties
of
cells
probably
caused
by
some
substance
produced
by
the
micro
organisms
changes
in
the
blood
vessels
then
ensue
the
arteries
becoming
dilated
and
the
rate
of
the
current
in
them
being
for  time
increased
active
hyperaemia
soon
however
the
rate
of
the
blood
flow
becomes
slower
than
normal
and
in
course
of
time
the
current
may
cease
stasis
and
the
blood
in
the
vessels
may
even
coagulate
thrombosis
coincidently
with
these
changes
in
the
vessels
the
leucocytes
in
the
blood
of
the
inflamed
part
rapidly
increase
in
number
and
they
become
viscous
and
adhere
to
the
vessel
wall
where
they
may
accumulate
in
large
numbers
in
course
of
time
the
leucocytes
pass
through
the
vessel
wall
emigration
of
leucocytes
and
move
towards
the
seat
of
infection
giving
rise
to  marked
degree
of
local
leucocytosis
through
the
openings
by
which
the
leucocytes
have
escaped
from
the
vessels
red
corpuscles
may
be
passively
extruded
diapedesis
of
red
corpuscles
these
processes
are
accompanied
by
changes
in
the
endothelium
of
the
vessel
walls
which
result
in
an
increased
formation
of
lymph
which
transudes
into
the
meshes
of
the
connective
tissue
giving
rise
to
an
inflammatory
oedema
or
if
the
inflammation
is
on  free
surface
forming
an
inflammatory
exudate
the
quantity
and
characters
of
this
exudate
vary
in
different
parts
of
the
body
and
according
to
the
nature
virulence
and
location
of
the
organisms
causing
the
inflammation
thus
it
may
be
serous
as
in
some
forms
of
synovitis
sero
fibrinous
as
in
certain
varieties
of
peritonitis
the
fibrin
tending
to
limit
the
spread
of
the
inflammation
by
forming
adhesions
croupous
when
it
coagulates
on  free
surface
and
forms  false
membrane
as
in
diphtheria
haemorrhagic
when
mixed
with
blood
or
purulent
when
suppuration
has
occurred
the
protective
effects
of
the
inflammatory
reaction
depend
for
the
most
part
upon
the
transudation
of
lymph
and
the
emigration
of
leucocytes
the
lymph
contains
the
opsonins
which
act
on
the
bacteria
and
render
them
less
able
to
resist
the
attack
of
the
phagocytes
as
well
as
the
various
protective
antibodies
which
neutralise
the
toxins
the
polymorph
leucocytes
are
the
principal
agents
in
the
process
of
phagocytosis  and
together
with
the
other
forms
of
phagocytes
they
ingest
and
destroy
the
bacteria
if
the
attempt
to
repel
the
invading
organisms
is
successful
the
irritant
effects
are
overcome
the
inflammation
is
arrested
and
resolution
is
said
to
take
place
certain
of
the
vascular
and
cellular
changes
are
now
utilised
to
restore
the
condition
to
the
normal
and
repair
ensues
after
the
manner
already
described
in
certain
situations
notably
in
tendon
sheaths
in
the
cavities
of
joints
and
in
the
interior
of
serous
cavities
for
example
the
pleura
and
peritoneum
the
restoration
to
the
normal
is
not
perfect
adhesions
forming
between
the
opposing
surfaces
if
however
the
reaction
induced
by
the
infection
is
insufficient
to
check
the
growth
and
spread
of
the
organisms
or
to
inhibit
their
toxin
production
local
necrosis
of
tissue
may
take
place
either
in
the
form
of
suppuration
or
of
gangrene
or
the
toxins
absorbed
into
the
circulation
may
produce
blood
poisoning
which
may
even
prove
fatal
clinical
aspects
of
inflammation
it
must
clearly
be
understood
that
inflammation
is
not
to
be
looked
upon
as  disease
in
itself
but
rather
as
an
evidence
of
some
infective
process
going
on
in
the
tissues
in
which
it
occurs
and
of
an
effort
on
the
part
of
these
tissues
to
overcome
the
invading
organisms
and
their
products
the
chief
danger
to
the
patient
lies
not
in
the
reactive
changes
that
constitute
the
inflammatory
process
but
in
the
fact
that
he
is
liable
to
be
poisoned
by
the
toxins
of
the
bacteria
at
work
in
the
inflamed
area
since
the
days
of
celsus
first
century  d
heat
redness
swelling
and
pain
have
been
recognised
as
cardinal
signs
of
inflammation
and
to
these
may
be
added
interference
with
function
in
the
inflamed
part
and
general
constitutional
disturbance
variations
in
these
signs
and
symptoms
depend
upon
the
acuteness
of
the
condition
the
nature
of
the
causative
organism
and
of
the
tissue
attacked
the
situation
of
the
part
in
relation
to
the
surface
and
other
factors
the
heat
of
the
inflamed
part
is
to
be
attributed
to
the
increased
quantity
of
blood
present
in
it
and
the
more
superficial
the
affected
area
the
more
readily
is
the
local
increase
of
temperature
detected
by
the
hand
this
clinical
point
is
best
tested
by
placing
the
palm
of
the
hand
and
fingers
for  few
seconds
alternately
over
an
uninflamed
and
an
inflamed
area
otherwise
under
similar
conditions
as
to
coverings
and
exposure
in
this
way
even
slight
differences
may
be
recognised
redness
similarly
is
due
to
the
increased
afflux
of
blood
to
the
inflamed
part
the
shade
of
colour
varies
with
the
stage
of
the
inflammation
being
lighter
and
brighter
in
the
early
hyperaemic
stages
and
darker
and
duskier
when
the
blood
flow
is
slowed
or
when
stasis
has
occurred
and
the
oxygenation
of
the
blood
is
defective
in
the
thrombotic
stage
the
part
may
assume  purplish
hue
the
swelling
is
partly
due
to
the
increased
amount
of
blood
in
the
affected
part
and
to
the
accumulation
of
leucocytes
and
proliferated
tissue
cells
but
chiefly
to
the
exudate
in
the
connective
tissue
inflammatory
oedema
the
more
open
the
structure
of
the
tissue
of
the
part
the
greater
is
the
amount
of
swelling
witness
the
marked
degree
of
oedema
that
occurs
in
such
parts
as
the
scrotum
or
the
eyelids
pain

seldom
absent
in
inflammation
tenderness
that
is
pain
elicited
on
pressure
is
one
of
the
most
valuable
diagnostic
signs
we
possess
and
is
often
present
before
pain
is
experienced
by
the
patient
that
the
area
of
tenderness
corresponds
to
the
area
of
inflammation
is
almost
an
axiom
of
surgery
pain
and
tenderness
are
due
to
the
irritation
of
nerve
filaments
of
the
part
rendered
all
the
more
sensitive
by
the
abnormal
conditions
of
their
blood
supply
in
inflammatory
conditions
of
internal
organs
for
example
the
abdominal
viscera
the
pain
is
frequently
referred
to
other
parts
usually
to
an
area
supplied
by
branches
from
the
same
segment
of
the
cord
as
that
supplying
the
inflamed
part
for
purposes
of
diagnosis
attention
should
be
paid
to
the
terms
in
which
the
patient
describes
his
pain
for
example
the
pain
caused
by
an
inflammation
of
the
skin
is
usually
described
as
of  burning
or
itching
character
that
of
inflammation
in
dense
tissues
like
periosteum
or
bone
or
in
encapsuled
organs
as
dull
boring
or
aching
when
inflammation
is
passing
on
to
suppuration
the
pain
assumes  throbbing
character
and
as
the
pus
reaches
the
surface
or
points
as
it
is
called
sharp
darting
or
lancinating
pains
are
experienced
inflammation
involving  nerve
trunk
may
cause  boring
or  tingling
pain
while
the
implication
of  serous
membrane
such
as
the
pleura
or
peritoneum
gives
rise
to  pain
of  sharp
stabbing
character
interference
with
the
function
of
the
inflamed
part
is
always
present
to  greater
or
less
extent
constitutional
disturbances
under
the
term
constitutional
disturbances
are
included
the
presence
of
fever
or
elevation
of
temperature
certain
changes
in
the
pulse
rate
and
the
respiration
gastro
intestinal
and
urinary
disturbances
and
derangements
of
the
central
nervous
system
these
are
all
due
to
the
absorption
of
toxins
into
the
general
circulation
temperature  marked
rise
of

is
one
of
the
most
constant
and
important
concomitants
of
acute
inflammatory
conditions
and
the

forms  fairly
reliable
index
of
the
state
of
the

with
the
nerve
centres
in
the
medulla
that
regulate
the
balance
between
the
production
and
the
loss
of

heat
clinically
the
temperature
is
estimated
by
means
of  self

thermometer
placed
for
from
one
to
five
minutes
in
close
contact
with
the
skin
in
the
axilla
or
in

sometimes
the
thermometer
is
inserted
into
the

where
however
the
temperature
is
normally  f
higher

may
be
about  f
the

is
more
easily

than
in

and
may
become
markedly
elevated  or  f
from
comparatively
slight
causes
in
the
aged
it
is
less
liable
to
change
so
that  rise
to  or  f
is
to
be
looked
upon
as
indicating  high
state
of
fever  sudden
rise
of
temperature
is
usually
associated
with  feeling
of
chilliness
down
the
back
and
in
the
limbs
which
may
be
so
marked
that
the
patient
shivers
violently
while
the
skin
becomes
cold

this
is  nervous
reaction
due
to  want
of
correspondence
between

temperature
of
the
body
and
is
known
clinically
as  rigor
when
the
temperature
rises
gradually
the
chill
is
usually
slight
and
may
be
unobserved
even
during
the
cold
stage
however
the
internal
temperature
is
already
raised
and
by
the
time
the

is
always
increased
in

the
natural
defensive
processes
as
well
as
to
counteract
the
local
and
general
effects
of
the

and
to
relieve

the
ideal
means
of
helping
the
tissues
is
by
removing
the
focus
of
infection
and
when
this
can
be
done
as
for
example
in  carbuncle
or
an
anthrax
pustule
the
infected
area
may
be
completely
excised
when
the
focus
is
not
sufficiently
limited
to
admit
of
this
the
infected
tissue
may
be
scraped
away
with
the

spoon
or
destroyed
by
caustics
or
by
the
actual
cautery
if
this
is
inadvisable
the
organisms
may
be
attacked
by
strong
antiseptics
such
as
pure

when
such
direct
means
as
the
above
are

much
can
be
done
to
aid
the
tissues
in
their
struggle
by
improving
the
condition
of
the
circulation
in
the
inflamed
area
so
as
to
ensure
that  plentiful
supply
of
fresh
arterial
blood
reaches
it
the
beneficial
effects
of

depend
on

experimentally
that
repeated

is
now
believed
that
the
so
called

act
in

the
method
of

has
been
properly

having
put
the

on  scientific
and
rational
basis
recognising
the

was
led
to
study
the
effects
of
increasing
the
hyperaemia
by
artificial
means
as  result
of
his
observations
he
has
formulated  method
of
treatment
which
consists
in
inducing
an
artificial
hyperaemia
in
the
inflamed
area
either
by
obstructing
the

an

two
hours
out

in
the
intervals
the
limb
is
elevated
to

to
empty

make

subsides
the
period
during

treatment
should
be
continued
for
some
days
after

are

with
which
owing
to

cannot
at

be
satisfactorily
classified
the
best
defined
group
is
that
of
the
granulomata
which
includes
such
important
diseases
as
tuberculosis
and
syphilis
and
in
which
different
types
of
chronic
inflammation
are
caused
by
infection
with  specific
organism
all
having
the
common
character
however
that
abundant

is
formed
in
which
cellular
changes
are
more
in
evidence
than
changes
in

and
in
which
the

and
necrosis
of
the
granulation
tissue
results
in
the
breaking
down
and
destruction
of
the
tissue
in
which
it
is
formed
another
group
is
that
in
which
chronic
inflammation
is
due
to
mild
or
attenuated
forms
of
pyogenic
infection
affecting
especially
the
lymph
glands
and
the
bone
marrow
in
the
glands
of
the

for
example
associated
with
various
forms
of

different
types
of
chronic
lymphadenitis
are
met
with
they
do
not
frankly
suppurate
as
do
the
acute
types
but
are
attended
with  hyperplasia
of
the
tissue
elements
which
results
in
enlargement
of
the
affected
glands
of  persistent
and
sometimes
of  relapsing
character
similar
varieties
of
osteomyelitis
are
met
with
that
do
not
like
the
acute
forms
go
on
to
suppuration
or
to
death
of

but
result
in
thickening
of
the
bone
affected
both
on
the
surface
and
in
the
interior
resulting
in
obliteration
of
the
medullary
canal  third
group
of
chronic
inflammations
are
those
that
begin
as
an
acute
pyogenic
inflammation
which
instead
of
resolving
completely
persists
in  chronic
form
it
does
so
apparently
because
there
is
some
factor
aiding
the
organisms
and
handicapping
the
tissues
such
as
the
presence
of  foreign
body  piece
of
glass
or

or  piece
of

in
these
circumstances
the
inflammation
persists
in  chronic
form
attended
with
the
formation
of
fibrous
tissue
and
in
the
case
of
bone
with
the
formation
of
new
bone
in
excess
it
will
be
evident
that
in
this
group
chronic
inflammation
and
repair
are
practically
interchangeable
terms
there
are
other
groups
of
chronic
inflammation
the
origin
of
which
continues
to

the
formation
of

leads
to
changes
in
the
secreting

resulting
in
the
formation
of

lastly
there
are
still
other
types
of
chronic
inflammation
attended
with
the
formation
of

on
such  liberal
scale
as

is
known
as

it
is  yellowish

acute
circumscribed
abscess
any
tissue
of
the

may
be
the
seat
of
an
acute
abscess
and
there
are
many
routes
by
which
the
bacteria
may
gain
access
to
the
affected
area
for
example
an
abscess
in
the
integument
or
subcutaneous
cellular
tissue
usually
results
from
infection
by
organisms
which
have
entered
through  wound
or
abrasion
of
the
surface
or
along
the
ducts
of
the
skin
an
abscess
in
the
breast
from
organisms
which
have
passed
along
the
milk
ducts
opening
on
the
nipple
or
along
the
lymphatics
which
accompany
these
an
abscess
in  lymph

is
usually
due

infection
passing
by
way
of
the
lymph
channels
from

area
of
skin
or
mucous

drained
by
them
abscesses
in
internal
organs
such
as
the
kidney
liver
or
brain
usually
result
from
organisms
carried
in
the
blood
stream
from
some
focus
of
infection
elsewhere
in
the
body  knowledge
of
the
possible
avenues
of
infection
is
of
clinical
importance
as
it
may
enable
the
source
of  given
abscess
to
be
traced
and
dealt
with
in
suppuration
in
the
fallopian
tube
pyosalpynx
for
example
the
fact
that
the
most
common
origin
of
the
infection
is
in
the
genital
passage
leads
to
examination
for
vaginal
discharge
and
if
none
is
present
the
abscess
is
probably
due
to
infection
carried
in
the
blood
stream
from
some
primary
focus
about
the
mouth
such
as  gumboil
or
an
infective
sore
throat
the
exact
location
of
an
abscess
also
may
furnish  key
to
its
source
in
axillary
abscess
for
example
if
the
suppuration
is
in
the
lymph
glands
the
infection
has
come
through
the
afferent
lymphatics
if
in
the
cellular
tissue
it
has
spread
from
the
neck
or
chest
wall
if
in
the
hair
follicles
it
is  local
infection
through
the
skin
formation
of
an
abscess
when
pyogenic
bacteria
are
introduced
into
the
tissue
there
ensues
an
inflammatory
reaction
which
is
characterised
by
dilatation
of
the
blood
vessels
exudation
of
large
numbers
of
leucocytes
and
proliferation
of
connective
tissue
cells
these
wandering
cells
soon
accumulate
round
the
focus
of
infection
and
form  protective
barrier
which
tends
to
prevent
the
spread
of
the
organisms
and
to
restrict
their
field
of
action
within
the
area
thus
circumscribed
the
struggle
between
the
bacteria
and
the
phagocytes
takes
place
and
in
the
process
toxins
are
formed
by
the
organisms  certain
number
of
the
leucocytes
succumb
and
becoming
degenerated
set
free
certain
proteolytic
enzymes
or
ferments
the
toxins
cause
coagulation
necrosis
of
the
tissue
cells
with
which
they
come
in
contact
the
ferments
liquefy
the
exudate
and
other
albuminous
substances
and
in
this
way
pus
is
formed
if
the
bacteria
gain
the
upper
hand
this
process
of
liquefaction
which
is
characteristic
of
suppuration
extends
into
the
surrounding
tissues
the
protective
barrier
of
leucocytes
is
broken
down
and
the
suppurative
process
spreads  fresh
accession
of
leucocytes
however
forms  new
barrier
and
eventually
the
spread
is
arrested
and
the
collection
of
pus
so
hemmed
in
constitutes
an
abscess
owing
to
the
swelling
and
condensation
of
the
parts
around
the
pus
thus
formed
is
under
considerable
pressure
and
this
causes
it
to
burrow
along
the
lines
of
least
resistance
in
the
case
of  subcutaneous
abscess
the
pus
usually
works
its
way
towards
the
surface
and
points
as
it
is
called
where
it
approaches
the
surface
the
skin
becomes
soft
and
thin
and
eventually
sloughs
allowing
the
pus
to
escape
an
abscess
forming
in
the
deeper
planes
is
prevented
from
pointing
directly
to
the
surface
by
the
firm
fasciae
and
other
fibrous
structures
the
pus
therefore
tends
to
burrow
along
the
line
of
the
blood
vessels
and
in
the
connective
tissue
septa
till
it
either
finds  weak
spot
or
causes  portion
of
fascia
to
undergo
necrosis
and
so
reaches
the
surface
accordingly
many
abscess
cavities
resulting
from
deep
seated
suppuration
are
of
irregular
shape
with
pouches
and
loculi
in
various
directions
an
arrangement
which
interferes
with
their
successful
treatment
by
incision
and
drainage
the
relief
of
tension
which
follows
the
bursting
of
an
abscess
the
removal
of
irritation
by
the
escape
of

an

vary
with
the
seat
of
the
abscess
when
it
is
situated
superficially
for

in

and
various
fallacies
are
to
be
guarded
against
in
applying
this

clinically
when
for

the

is
to

in

that
when

certainly
occurred

the

of

may
be
employed
an

introduced
and
the
subsequent
treatment
carried
out
as

and
treated
by
the

method
it
is
seldom
advisable
to
wash
out
an

and
squeezing
out
the

is
also
to
be
avoided
lest
the
protective
zone
be
broken
down
and
the

be
diffused
into
the
surrounding

the
importance
of
taking
precautions
against
further
infection
in
opening
an
abscess
can
scarcely
be
exaggerated
and
the
rapidity
with
which
healing
occurs
when
the
access
of
fresh
bacteria
is
prevented
is
in
marked
contrast
to
what
occurs
when
such
precautions
are
neglected
and
further

is
allowed
to
take
place
acute

if
in
the
course
of

itself
and
the

changes
as

take
place
modified
however
by
the
fact
that
the

can
more
readily
reach
the
surface
in
from
twenty
four
to
forty
eight
hours
the

is
conscious
of  sensation

at
the

time
he
feels
generally

it
may

his

it
is
found
that
the

for
some

around
are

are
most
intense
in

of
the

the
edges
of

moist
any
stitches
that
may
have
been
introduced
are
tight
and
the
deep
ones
may
be

which
is
increased
by

be
cut
pus
escapes
the

and
its

are
found
to
be

the
open

is
the
only
safe
means
of
treating
such
wounds
the
infected
surface
may
be
sponged
over
with
pure
carbolic
acid
the
excess
of
which
is
washed
off
with
absolute
alcohol
and
the

either
drained
by
tubes
or
packed
with
iodoform
gauze
the
practice
of
scraping
such
surfaces
with
the
sharp
spoon
squeezing
or
even
of
washing
them
out
with
antiseptic
lotions
is
attended
with
the
risk
of
further
diffusing
the
organisms
in
the
tissue
and
is
only
to
be
employed
under
exceptional
circumstances
continuous
irrigation
of
infected
wounds
or
their
immersion
in
antiseptic
baths
is
sometimes
useful
the
free
opening
up
of
the
wound
is
almost
immediately
followed
by  fall
in
the
temperature
the
surrounding
inflammation
subsides
the

of

lessens
and

takes
place
by
the

as  rule
do
not
appear
for
seven
or
eight
days
after
the
operation
and
it
may
be
not
till
after
the

have
united
the
suppuration

strictly
localised
to
the

of
the

where

was
employed
for
stitches
or
ligatures
and
shows
little
tendency
to
spread
the
infected
part
however
is
often
long
of
healing
the
irritation
in
these
cases
is
probably
due
to
toxins
in
the
catgut
and
not
to
bacteria
when
suppuration
occurs
in
connection
with
buried

of
unabsorbable
materials
such
as

the

may
arise
from
the

more
frequently
perhaps
from
the

disinfected
the

but
in

the

prognosis
the
occurrence
of
septicaemia
is
the
most
serious
risk
and
it
is
in
cases
of
diffuse
suppurative
cellulitis
that
this
form
of
blood
poisoning
assumes
its
most
aggravated
forms
the
toxins
of
the
streptococci
are
exceedingly
virulent
and
induce
local
death
of
tissue
so
rapidly
that
the
protective
emigration
of
leucocytes
fails
to
take
place
in
some
cases
the
passage
of
masses
of
free
cocci
in
the
lymphatics
or
of
infective
emboli
in
the
blood
vessels
leads
to
the
formation
of
pyogenic
abscesses
in
vital
organs
such
as
the
brain
lungs
liver
kidneys
or
other
viscera
haemorrhage
from
erosion
of
arterial
or
venous
trunks
may
take
place
and
endanger
life
treatment
the
treatment
of
diffuse
cellulitis
depends
to  large
extent
on
the
situation
and
extent
of
the
affected
area
and
on
the
stage
of
the
process
in
the
limbs
for
example
where
the
application
of  constricting

is
practicable
bier  method
of

excellent
results
if

moist
dressing
placed
over
the
wounds
to
absorb
the

the
whole

be
covered
with
gauze
wrung
out

the
dressing
is
changed
as
often
as
necessary
and
in
the
intervals
when
the

off
gentle

should
be
carried
out
to

the
formation
of

have
found
the
immersion
of

should
be
placed
in
the
attitude
which
in
the
event
of

interfere
with
its
usefulness
the

be
necessary
to
make
one

and
to
insert

several
varieties

while
it
is
convenient
to
describe

separately
it
is
to
be
clearly
understood
that
clinically
they
merge
one
into

is
squeezed
or
knocked
against
anything
in
the
course
of  few

swollen
there
is
continuous
pain
which
soon
assumes  throbbing
character
particularly
when
the

and
may
be
so
severe
as
to
prevent
sleep
and
the
patient
may
feel
generally
out
of

if  constricting

is
applied
at
this
stage
the
infection
can
usually
be
checked
and
the
occurrence
of
suppuration
prevented
if
this
fails
or
if
the
condition
is
allowed
to
go
untreated
the
inflammatory

increases
and
terminates

the
main
incidence
of
the

is
on
the

of
the
flexor

it
is
not
always
possible
to
determine
whether
it
started
there

some
cases
both
connective

planes
are
involved

becomes
red
painful
and

the
swelling
spreading
to

the
involvement
of
the

is
usually
indicated
by
the
patient
being
unable
to
flex
the
finger
and
by
the
pain
being
increased

to
do
so

subperiosteal
whitlow
this

is
usually
an
extension
of

begins
in

of
the
terminal
phalanx
it
may
lead
to
necrosis
of  portion
or
even
of
the
entire

this
is
usually
recognised
by
the
persistence
of

have
passed
off

by
feeling

is
often
seriously
impaired

is
true
that  chronic

is
sometimes
met
with
for
example
in
the

and
in
the
marrow
of
long
bones
in
the
great
majority
of
instances
the

of

with
tuberculosis  sinus

sinus  sinus
is  track
leading
from  focus
of

it
usually
represents
the
path
by
which
the

escapes
from
an
abscess
cavity

has
been
prevented
from

from
mechanical
causes

tissue
and
when
it
is

may
be
dragged
below
the

by
contraction
of
the
scar
tissue
around
it
as  sinus
will
persist
until
the
obstacle
to

such
as  piece
of

acting
mechanically
or
by
keeping
up
discharge
and
if
the
body
is
removed
the
sinus
usually
heals
the
presence
of  foreign
body
is
often
suggested
by  mass
of
redundant
granulations
at
the
mouth
of
the
sinus

passes
through  muscle
the
repeated
contractions
tend
to
prevent
healing
until

is
kept
at

put
out

its
fibres
the
sinuses
associated
with
empyema
are
prevented
from
healing
by
the
rigidity
of
the
chest
wall

will
only
close
after
an
operation
which
admits
of
the
cavity
being
obliterated
in
any
case
it
is
necessary
to
disinfect
the
track

it
may
be
to
remove
the
unhealthy
granulations
lining
it
by
means
of
the
sharp
spoon
or
to
excise
it
bodily
to
encourage
healing
from
the
bottom
the
cavity
should
be
packed
with
bismuth
or
iodoform
gauze
the
healing
of
long
and
tortuous
sinuses
is
often
hastened
by
the
injection
of

disfigurement
is
likely
to
follow
from
cicatricial
contraction
for
example
in  sinus
over
the
lower
jaw
associated
with  carious

the
sinus
should
be
excised
and
the
raw
surfaces
approximated
with

an
abnormal

we
have
here
to
consider
under

terms
sapraemia
septicaemia
and
pyaemia
certain
general
effects
of
pyogenic
infection
which
although
their
clinical
manifestations
may
vary
are
all
associated
with
the
action
of
the
same
forms
of

may
occur
separately
or
in
combination

one
may
follow
on
and
merge
into
another
sapraemia
or
septic
intoxication
is
the
name
applied
to  form
of
poisoning
resulting
from
the
absorption
into
the
blood
of
the
toxic
products
of
pyogenic
bacteria
these
products
which
are
of
the
nature
of
alkaloids
act
immediately
on
their
entrance
into
the
circulation
and
produce
effects
in
direct
proportion
to
the
amount
absorbed
as
the
toxins
are
gradually
eliminated
from
the
body
the
symptoms
abate
and
if
no
more
are
introduced
they
disappear
sapraemia
in
these
respects
therefore
is
comparable
to
poisoning
by
any
other
form
of
alkaloid
such
as
strychnin
or
morphin
clinical
features
the
symptoms
of
sapraemia
seldom
manifest
themselves
within
twenty
four
hours
of
an
operation
or

because
it
takes
some
time
for
the
bacteria
to
produce  sufficient
dose
of
their
poisons

not

seat
of
infection
but
also
from

metastatic
collections
like
septicaemia
this
condition
is
due
to
pyogenic
bacteria
the

pyogenes
being

found
the

is
usually
in  wound
for

cases
occur
in

takes
place
through
