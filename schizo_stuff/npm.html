<li> Add a "repository" field (follow the pattern from Table 3.2 on that same page)
<li> run "npm pack" on the command line to create a zip file 
<li> run "npm publish" to publish at npmjs.com
<li> You can find lots of <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/">documentation</a> for npm including information on how to update your project.
<li> If you screw up, you can unpublish the project, update the version number and publish it again.
<li> Now create a new directory in your home directory called test.  cd into that directory and type "npm install [npm name]".  This should install your code in the new directory.
